SEATTLE (AP) -- Two vehicles that fell into a sinkhole caused 
by a water main break in North Seattle were towed to street 
level Thursday to allow city workers to repair a 10-by-15-foot 
gap in the University Bridge's foundation.

Bikes and pedestrians were allowed back on the bridge at 7 a.m.
 and cars started moving across the span around 3 p.m., said
 Gregg H. Hirakawa, spokesman for the city Transportation 
Department.

"We're still asking motorists to use caution in the area" because
 there's still a lot of work being done, he said.

Hirakawa said the corner of the bridge where city workers poured
 a slurry of concrete and sand was designed to carry a maximum
 load of 300 tons - when it's not missing part of its foundation.

"We do have a section of the bridge that is being supported by
 open space, and air is not a good support," he said.

The bridge, used by 31,400 vehicles daily, didn't collapse because
most of its weight was distributed elsewhere, Hirakawa explained.

The flood of water Wednesday also opened up a sinkhole 8 to 10
 feet deep and 30 to 40 feet wide that swallowed two cars and
 closed the lone street to more than 50 houseboats.

City workers have turned a walkway into a temporary road to give
 houseboat residents and repair crews access to the area, 
Hirakawa said. It will take a few more days to repair the
 sinkhole, he said.

The 2-foot-diameter cast iron pipe may have been leaking since
 Tuesday, but the rupture became evident shortly after 7:30 a.m.
 Wednesday when a muddy cascade emerged near the southern 
foundation of the bridge, which was closed within minutes.
