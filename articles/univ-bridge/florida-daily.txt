SEATTLE (AP) - A water main break responsible for a sinkhole
 that swallowed two cars also created a large gap in a nearby
 bridge's foundation that workers were filling in Thursday, 
city officials said.

University Bridge over Portage Bay was opened to bikes and
 pedestrians Thursday but remained closed to vehicle traffic 
as the 10-by-15-foot gap was filled in, a job that was expected
 to be finished that night, said Gregg H. Hirakawa, spokesman 
for the city Transportation Department.

"We do have a section of the bridge that is being supported by
 open space, and air is not a good support," Hirakawa said. The
 bridge, which is used by about 31,400 vehicles daily, won't 
collapse because most of its weight is distributed elsewhere, 
he added.

The bridge was closed Wednesday morning after the rupture of
 a 90-year-old water main unleashed a muddy cascade near the
 span's southern foundation. The sinkhole the flooding opened 
up on a nearby street is 8 to 10 feet deep and 30 to 40 feet 
wide.

Jorge Maya, kitchen manager at a nearby Red Robin restaurant,
 said he tried to move his Dodge minivan as the asphalt 
slumped around it but wound up having to flee as his car sank
 into the muddy hole.

"It was scary," Maya said.

It took until late Wednesday afternoon to restore water service
 to areas south of the bridge, a key route to the University of
 Washington.
