SEATTLE -- Seattle officials said there was no structural damage
 to the University Bridge from a broken water main that
 undermined an area under the bridge's southern end.

The bridge reopened to vehicle traffic on Thursday afternoon, 
31 hours after the main broke and caused a sinkhole that
 swallowed two cars.

Transportation crews continue to repair the sinkhole. Crews built
 a temporary bypass to reconnect people cut off when the water
 washed away the only road in and out of their Portage Bay
 neighborhood. It runs through the nearby Red Robin restaurant 
parking lot.

"We're still asking motorists to use caution in the area" because
 there's still a lot of work being done, said Gregg H. Hirakawa,
 spokesman for the city Transportation Department.

Hirakawa said the corner of the bridge where city workers poured
 a slurry of concrete and sand was designed to carry a maximum
 load of 300 tons -- when it's not missing part of its
 foundation.

"We do have a section of the bridge that is being supported by
 open space, and air is not a good support," he said.

The bridge, used by 31,400 vehicles daily, didn't collapse 
because most of its weight was distributed elsewhere, Hirakawa
 explained.

The 2-foot-diameter cast iron pipe may have been leaking since
 Tuesday, but the rupture became evident shortly after 7:30 a.m.
 Wednesday when a muddy cascade emerged near the southern 
foundation of the bridge, which was closed within minutes.
