It's the second major water main break in as many weeks in the
 Seattle area. This time, a 24-inch diameter line scoured out
 a hole so large it ate two cars.


A 10-foot long crack formed in the 95-year-old cast iron pipe.

Jorge Maya tried to get his minivan away when the leak started 
at 7:30 Wednesday morning.

Jorge says, "The car started going down, and I jumped out of
 my car. I was very scared."

The size of the pit is amazing, estimated at 9 feet deep and
 30 to 40 feet long.

Underground telephone lines were cut, and a gas line threatened.

But a big concern is whether the approach to the University 
Bridge was undermined.

Gregg Hirakawa of the Seattle Department of Transportation says,
 "We have determined there is some undermining under this
 structure. We've put underwater cameras down there, and the
 undermining is such that we have to go down there to make a
 final determination.

Just last week, another water main broke under Dexter Avenue 
north, a 20 inch diameter line.

The events are rare, but are two lines breaking in two weeks
 just a wierd coincidence, or is Seattle's fresh water 
infrastructure taking a turn for the worse?

Gregg Hirakawa says, "The industry standard is 100 years. 
The analysis we're doing indicates that the life in our system
 is probably 150 to 200 years old."
