Cars rattle again over University Bridge
Water main break had closed span

The University Bridge reopened to vehicles Thursday afternoon, after workers finished filling a gaping earthen hole and commuters endured two mornings of traffic woes.

The busy bridge, used by more than 30,000 cars a day, was closed Wednesday morning after a large water main burst under its southern end, creating a sinkhole that devoured two unoccupied cars.

The hole included a significant amount of soil erosion under the bridge's southeastern support. Transportation workers finished filling that void with more than 40 cubic yards of concrete and sand Thursday.

"We're happy that it did not cause damage to the structural integrity of the bridge," said Mary Beth Turner, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of Transportation. "We're sorry that it did inconvenience all the residents in that area. That's an area where we've had slides several times before, so they're kind of used to the drill."

Although the bridge is considered structurally sound, transportation workers will continue to measure movement in the supports.

The bridge's 3 p.m. reopening came in time for the annual boating festivities this weekend. The event, which celebrates the opening of boating season, involves the closure of the nearby Montlake Bridge to car traffic.

Elsewhere, city crews had much to do. The broken main spilled 3 million gallons of water, creating a sinkhole measuring about 30 feet wide by 50 feet long. It washed out Portage Bay Place East, a small road accessed by residents of about 100 homes, most of them houseboats.

Utility crews will also repair the broken water main -- a cast-iron, 24-inch-diameter pipe -- and inspect it for why it cracked. The pipe was laid in 1917, but cast-iron mains are often expected to last 150 to 200 years.

"It's been through some pretty big earthquakes," said Joe Mickelson, a Seattle Public Utilities water-operations director.

He said the rerouted water is working fine for now, but the pipe needs to be fixed to accommodate increased summer water demand.

On Thursday, transportation workers were paving an alternative road for residents through the steep parking lot of Red Robin, a popular fixture in the Eastlake neighborhood.

With the din of excavators and bulldozers around him, the restaurant's facilities manager, John Allen, shrugged.

"You just kind of have to take it with a smile," he said. "You take the good with the bad."

Houseboat resident Ellyn Swanson was grateful that her water and gas were back on. As she walked her dog, Penny, the one inconvenience she had now was that Penny couldn't go under the bridge -- something she likes to do.

"It's all nice and quiet now," Swanson said.

Blaine Hammond, who also lives on a houseboat, said he was glad he had just shopped for groceries before the water main ruptured. City crews had allowed residents a short opportunity to move cars off the washed-out road Wednesday, but Hammond had been busy at the time.

Hammond often walked the University Bridge for errands. As he walked it Thursday morning, he enjoyed the sun and an unusually quiet span.
