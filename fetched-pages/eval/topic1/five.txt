http://./topic1/five.txt	MEXICO CITY - A raven-haired Miss Japan, Riyo Mori, was crowned Miss Universe 2007 yesterday in a contest marked by protests, a banned dress and the withdrawal of one beauty queen on the ground the pageant degrades women.		Mori, 20, the 56th winner of the title, was given her US$250,000 diamond-and-pearl crown by last year's winner, Zuleyka Rivera of Puerto Rico, watched by a live audience of 10,000 and some 600 million television viewers worldwide.		A lifelong ballet dancer from a village near Mount Fuji, Mori wore a striking black gown with colored lapels for the final. Winning surpassed the ambition of her grandmother, who told her as a child she wanted her to be Miss Japan one day.		"My mind went blank," she said of the winning moment.		During the evening gown parade, Miss USA, Rachel Smith, slipped on the runway and landed on her bottom, although the slip didn't stop her earning fifth place.		This year's contest was marked by controversy, with a handful of Mexicans booing Smith in the run-up to the finals because of what they saw as US unfriendliness toward illegal immigrants.
