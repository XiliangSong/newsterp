http://./topic2/two.txt	2 whales thought to have returned to ocean		By Eric Bailey	Tribune Newspapers: Los Angeles Times	Published May 31, 2007		SACRAMENTO -- Disappearing just as quietly as they arrived, a pair of wounded humpback whales that spent more than two weeks wandering up the Sacramento River appear to have slipped back into the sea, officials said Wednesday.		The mother and calf, who had cruised aimlessly as far inland as the Port of Sacramento, were last spotted Tuesday evening off Tiburon, 5 miles northeast of the Golden Gate Bridge.

But while it is possible they took another wrong turn and headed into the southern waters of San Francisco Bay, authorities are hopeful they made their escape to the Pacific Ocean.		"They arrived here quietly, and if they've made their way outside the Golden Gate, they've gone out quietly," said Bernadette Fees, a California Fish and Game spokeswoman.		If so, it marked the end of a rhapsodic sojourn by a pair that captured international attention and enticed tens of thousands of Northern Californians to perch on riverbank levees for a glimpse.		The mother and calf arrived in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta on May 13, their backsides bearing fresh wounds likely caused by a run-in with a ship. Repeated attempts to herd the whales past a bridge across the Sacramento River in Rio Vista failed, but on Sunday they began their return trip to the sea without prodding.
