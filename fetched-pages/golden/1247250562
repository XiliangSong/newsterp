Gardeners have been warned that using pesticides increases the risk of developing Parkinson's disease by more than 40 per cent. An EU-funded study - one of the biggest of its kind - confirms suspicions that chemicals found in everyday products are doing untold damage to health. The study's author, Aberdeen University expert Dr Finlay Dick, called for more research to pin down products and chemicals responsible for damaging the brain. Parkinson's disease affects 120,000 Britons, with 10,000 new cases each year. Although it is most common in the over-60s, the brain disorder can strike at any time. Sufferers include actor Michael J Fox, who was just 30 when diagnosed, and former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali. For the latest study, researchers questioned 3,000 men and women, a third of whom had Parkinson's or similar conditions. The Scottish, Swedish, Italian, Romanian and Maltese volunteers were asked about their use of pesticides such as fly sprays and weedkillers over their lives, both at work and at home. They were also asked if they had ever been knocked unconscious, if they smoked, and if any family members had Parkinson's. Analysis of the results revealed that those who had used pesticides the most were 41 per cent more likely to have developed Parkinson's than those who had never been exposed to the chemicals. Even low levels of exposure raised the risk by 13 per cent. Those who had suffered repeated blows to the head were more than two and a half times more likely to have developed Parkinson's. Even a single knock-out blow raised the risk by 35 per cent, the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine-reported. Having a family history of Parkinson's also raised the odds of developing the disease. However, smoking appeared to have a protective effect, a finding which echoes many previous studies. The reason for this is thought to be that the balance of chemicals in the brain that leads to people becoming addicted to cigarettes also makes them less likely to develop Parkinson's - not that any substance in cigarettes wards off disease. Dr Kieran Breen, of the Parkinson's Disease Society, said: "The important finding from this study is that Parkinson's is not caused by any one factor, but instead a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors." Peter Sanguinetti, of the Crop Protection Association, which represents pesticide manufacturers, said that product safety is a priority. He stressed, however, that the latest study did not find conclusive evidence of a link between pesticides and Parkinson's. No comments have so far been submitted.

The Southern African country is among the worst hit by the HIV/Aids pandemic, killing more than 3 000 people every week and accounting for 70% of hospital admissions. But Zimbabwe, in the grips of a deep recession, has also become one of the few Aids bright spots on the continent after its HIV prevalence rate declined to 18,1% last year from 25% six years ago. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said the number of people receiving the life-prolonging medicines has increased from 60 000 in December to 80 000 this month but that the government would add another 40 000 patients by the end of the year. "Currently the number of people on ARVs has grown to 80 000 since December last year and we hope to achieve our target of getting 120 000 by the end of the year," Parirenyatwa told the government controlled Parirenyatwa said that at least 300 000 people living with HIV/Aids were in urgent need of ARVs. Zimbabwe's drive to increase access to ARVs has been hampered by a severe shortage of foreign currency, itself a sign of an economic crisis that has pushed inflation past 3 700% and increased poverty levels. The crisis has been particularly felt in the health sector, where basic drugs are in short supply while strikes for better pay by doctors and nurses have worsened the situation. President Robert Mugabe -- who says Zimbabwe is showing the way for Africa in the fight against HIV/Aids -- rejects charges of mismanagement and blames the West for sabotaging the economy as punishment for seizing white-owned farms to distribute to black Zimbabweans. - Reuters Zimbabwe to boost police force for elections Most of detained Zim opposition activists freed Mugabe ready to seize foreign firms news on your cellphone (R1 one-off) or find out more Listen to the new M&G Online podcast Add M&G Online news to your website or blog Get M&G Online news in your RSS reader For more news, go to the M&G Online home page Find your match now!

They may not know they can possibly drink their way to safer skin. Bells and a breeze offer an afternoon of relaxation in the sun. But to protect yourself from sun damage and skin cancer Dermatologist Dr. Bryan Chen warns that you should follow this advice, "The use of sunscreens to cover up the best that you can from the sun, the use of hats during the day, and try to avoid the sun during the hours of 10 in the morning to two in the afternoon when the sun intensity is the greatest outdoors." He adds, "That, in combination with drinking tea, I think would be useful." Drinking just one cup of tea a day will lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer,squamos and basal cell carcinoma, reports the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dr. Chen says, "Teas have long been known to contain antioxidants in them, and also chemicals called polyfenals." In the first human study of more than 2,000 people, tea&#39;s antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun&#39;s ultraviolet rays. But, Dr Chen says tea isn&#39;t the cure all for skin cancer; "Just because you drink tea doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a 100% protection against the development of skin cancer. You really do need to do it in combination with other protective measures protect yourself from the sun." Scientists found the more tea you drink each day and over the years, the better the skin protection. It doesn&#39;t matter if the tea is hot or cold, and all types of tea offered protection, including green, black and herbal tea.

EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou did not move to impose strict rules on food companies - like those used to reduce smoking - when he unveiled his plans to combat obesity. But he warned the industry against complacency. "Industry must realise that time is running out if we are to get results at EU level. We have given them enough incentive to become more energetic and involved, or risk legislation," Mr Kyprianou said. "But it is still my belief that self-regulation gets quicker results as we all know the length of time it can take to introduce legislation." Of the 300 million adults worldwide who are technically obese or overweight, more than 15 million live in the EU. EU figures show an estimated three million European schoolchildren are now obese. Obesity could affect one in 10 children in Europe and Central Asia by 2010. Some consumer groups and non-governmental organisations had sought greater action by Brussels in its strategy paper, released today, such as tighter advertising regulations and more specific rules on food labelling. "It seems that the Commission has taken the easy way out by adopting a voluntary approach, combined with policy of wait-and-see," said Jim Murray, director of European Consumers' Organisation BEUC. "We were expecting a much more robust commitment from the Commission, taking a strong stance on nutritional labelling and introducing a binding approach to tackle the issue of advertising to children." The document upholds the model of an "obesity platform", set up by the executive Commission in 2005 following its first discussion paper on the issue. This approach brings industry, consumer groups and health experts together to find ways to combat obesity. But it emphasises self-regulation and pulls away from delivering legislation from Brussels. Both CIAA, which represents Europe's food and drink industry, and the Association of the Chocolate, Biscuit and Confectionery Industries (CAOBISCO) welcomed Wednesday's announcement. "Industry has been moving forward on this and will continue to do so. But at the end of the day its not about good and bad food, it's about good and bad diet," said David Zimmer, CAOBISCO general secretary and executive member of CIAA. Since the formation of the platform, a number of CIAA members, such as Coca Cola and Pepsi said they have stopped airing ads for children under 12 and taken vending machines out of primary schools. The paper said the Commission proposed a revision of nutrition labelling, programs to promote healthy eating, and a study on sport, among other measures. An initial report by the Commission is due in 2010.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/17-6&fd=R&url=http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/health/feeds/hscout/2007/05/30/hscout605049.html&cid=1116794948&ei=m-xeRuzZAoL0rQOB45zVDQ Parkinson's Linked to Pesticides, Head Trauma - Forbes.com Parkinson's Linked to Pesticides, Head Trauma 05.30.07, 12:00 AM ET WEDNESDAY, May 30 (HealthDay News) -- Pesticides and head injury can both bump up risks for Parkinson's disease, European researchers report. Moreover, odds for the illness increase as exposure to these brain insults rises, the report found. For example, "Those who were heavily exposed to pesticides had a 41 percent increased risk of developing Parkinson&#39;s disease, and those with lower exposure had a 13 percent increased risk," said lead researcher Dr. Finlay Dick, from the Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine at Aberdeen University Medical School, Aberdeen, U.K. In addition, people who were knocked unconscious even once had a 35 percent increased risk of developing Parkinson&#39;s, Dick said. That finding has real implications for sports such as boxing, the researchers said. In fact, professional boxing legend Muhammad Ali, 65, now suffers from advanced Parkinson&#39;s disease. The findings are published in the May 30 online edition of Occupational and Environmental Medicine According to the National Parkinson Foundation, 1.5 million Americans currently have the degenerative illness, which strikes men and women in roughly equal numbers, usually after the age of 65. In the study, Dick&#39;s team collected data on 959 people with Parkinson&#39;s or Parkinson&#39;s-like syndromes and almost 2,000 people without the condition. All the people were questioned about their exposure to pesticides as well as iron, copper and manganese. They were also asked if they had ever having been knocked unconscious or had a family history of Parkinson&#39;s disease. The team found that people who had been exposed to low levels of pesticides were 13 percent more likely to have Parkinson&#39;s compared to people who had never been exposed. And people exposed to high levels of pesticides were 41 percent more likely to develop the condition. Dick&#39;s group also found that Parkinson&#39;s disease occurred 35 percent more often in people who had been knocked unconscious once compared with those who had never been knocked out, and more than two-and-a-half times more frequently in people who had been knocked out more often. In terms of pesticides, the researchers don&#39;t know which compounds are most likely to increase the risk for Parkinson&#39;s, Dick said. More research is needed, he added. One take-home message: avoiding head injury is a good way to cut Parkinson&#39;s risk. "This has implications for contact sports, particularly for things like boxing," Dick said. One expert lauded the research. "This study adds to a growing body of evidence that points toward an association between exposure to environmental issues being related to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson&#39;s disease," said Dr. Michael S. Okun, the medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation. He speculated that environmental exposures may trigger genes that spur the illness. "In some way, environmental exposures are affecting a series of events that unfold in the human brain that result in neurodegenerative diseases," he said. While the causes of Parkinson&#39;s aren&#39;t known, Okun believes that it is a combination of factors, such as a genetic predisposition for the disease, coupled with environmental triggers. "It would be a mistake to assume that this is a disease linked directly to pesticides or linked directly to genes and to close the door on potential interactions between them," he said.

The suspects met in chat rooms on web and made dates with victims for sex parties. There victims were drugged with Gamma Hydroxy Butyrate (GHB), a neuroactive drug which make people high, and then injected with HIV-infected blood, according to police in Groningen. One of the suspects had a large amount of GHB in his possession. The remaining three suspects also had quantities of the drug, police said Wednesday. The police first received reports about the parties in June last year. The first victim filed a report in February. The suspects were all arrested in early May.

I know I would, but I am all too aware of the risks carried by UV rays. American Academy of Dermatology , there are more than one million cases of skin cancer diagnosed every year in the U.S., and one's level of sun exposure is the most preventable risk factor for the disease. Artificial methods such as tanning beds and sunlamps are just as dangerous, due to their UV-ray emission. There is one safe way, though -- faking a sun-kissed glow with self-tanning creams, sprays or wipes. The Top 10 Rocket Stocks for This Week Five Stocks With Serious 'Catch-Upside' Dykstra: A Marvellous Call on Semis 30 Stocks on Sale The Top 10 Biotech Short Squeezes There are several different ways to apply these products. If you're the type who enjoys the pampering experience, I would recommend looking at your local spa for self-tanning treatment options. But if you just want a quick dose of color, go to a department or beauty store and select from an array of products from such brands as ), Clinique, Neutrogena and Clarins (about $15-$40). Even though self-tanning products are designed for easy, at-home application, the process does require a bit of practice. Lise Jorgensen, vice president of global skincare product development at Estee Lauder recommends the following steps for an even, desirable result: Exfoliate beforehand: Smooth skin helps the color develop more evenly and last longer. Apply evenly, concentrating on one area at a time. Go lightly on areas where color can develop darker, such as elbows, knees and ankles. Blend thoroughly using small circular motions. Immediately wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. Allow body formulas to dry completely before dressing. Always take your time when applying the self tanners. "Use an even coating on the shoulders, arms and legs," says Kaheem Todmann, a skincare specialist at Clarins. And beware of products that are excessively thick. " [They] can make the skin appear muddy or dirty," says Todmann. So how do self-tanning products work? Most contain a chemical called dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which reacts with the amino acids found in certain proteins in our skin. "The reaction forms a colored complex which gives the skin a tanned appearance," explains Jorgensen. DHA has been approved as a safe cosmetic ingredient by the Food and Drug Administration for decades.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070531.whospital31/BNStory/National/home&cid globeandmail.com: Neonatal unit shut after infection kills baby Letters to the Editor Neonatal unit shut after infection kills baby Globe and Mail Update May 31, 2007 at 3:34 AM EDT &#151; A highly feared bacterial infection has killed a premature baby at a downtown Toronto hospital, sparking special hygiene measures and the closing of a neonatal intensive care unit. The infant died of bacteremia, commonly known as blood poisoning, at Mount Sinai Hospital after acquiring serratia, a particularly harmful pathogen that can cause severe infections in babies, Allison McGeer, the hospital's director of infection control, confirmed in a telephone interview Wednesday. &ldquo;This is one of the organisms we really worry about it,&rdquo; Dr. McGeer said. &ldquo;... This is not an organism you take any chances with.&rdquo; In this case, the infant, described as weighing between about one and three pounds (500 and 1,500 grams), succumbed to the infection over the weekend. The gender of the child could not be provided, due to patient confidentiality, said Jodi Salem, the hospital's spokeswoman. A second baby, who also tested positive for serratia, an organism found fairly commonly in the bowels of adults, is in isolation at Mount Sinai but is not seriously ill. &ldquo;It is so awful for new parents, such a tragedy that these babies die,&rdquo; Dr. McGeer said. &ldquo;It's also extremely hard on the staff who work in the unit because every one of those babies is their baby, too.&rdquo; The death of the infant, described as very premature, has prompted special infection-control procedures, including improved hand hygiene and the wearing of gowns and gloves in the 54-bed neonatal intensive care unit, which cares for some of the most fragile babies in the province. Mount Sinai's level 3 neonatal unit, where the most fragile infants are admitted, remained closed last night. Late yesterday afternoon, the hospital reopened level 2 of the neonatal intensive care unit, Dr. McGeer said. Since Monday, there have been three transfers of patients, including pregnant and new mothers, which would have had to happen anyway as the neonatal care unit is at maximum capacity. The baby's death is a tragedy for parents who will mourn a lost future. But it comes at a time when Mount Sinai plans to renovate its neonatal intensive care unit to fix a problem endemic to many Canadian hospitals: too many sick babies in cramped spaces. To minimize infection, experts recommend there be 10 feet between incubators. But hospitals built decades ago, such as Mount Sinai, have only four to five feet between these babies, Dr. McGeer said. Mount Sinai is contemplating whether they should have separate rooms altogether. From an infection-control point of view, experts recommend babies in neonatal intensive care units be in a single room that is 150 square feet and that all babies be 10 feet apart. But that design could potentially spell problems for monitoring them as it could be more difficult to provide treatment to them quickly in an emergency. &ldquo;There's nothing that happened to this baby where mistakes were made or there were obvious problems in care,&rdquo; said Dr. McGeer, adding that Mount Sinai's rate of hospital-acquired infections is very low. &ldquo;Does that mean when we move to single rooms in our new NICU [neonatal intensive care unit] that wouldn't have been one of the deaths that would happen? I can't tell you that. There's really no way of knowing which of those babies is going to be the baby who doesn't die.&rdquo; Though it may sound a rare occurrence, hospital-acquired infections are frighteningly common. They are the fourth-leading cause of death, with 8,000 to 12,000 Canadians dying of them every year, according to Dick Zoutman, physician director of the Community and Hospital Infection Control Association of Canada. &ldquo;People die one at a time,&rdquo; Dr. Zoutman said in a telephone interview from Kingston yesterday, &ldquo;but it's bigger than car accidents, it's bigger than breast cancer, it's bigger than colon cancer. It's huge.&rdquo; Crucial to minimizing serratia infections is hand hygiene, facility design and adequate space, he said. Though serratia is &ldquo;not the most common infection, it is the most feared outbreak in neonatal units,&rdquo; Dr. Zoutman said, adding that when it sweeps through neonatal intensive care units, it can cause pneumonia, meningitis and bacteremia, such as in this most recent case. Treatment is with intravenous antibiotics, which race to stamp out the virulent organism as it travels through the bloodstream. Serratia is known to stimulate an immense immune system reaction: a patient becomes delirious, blood pressure drops and septic shock and organ failure follows. Dr. Zoutman said much more research needs to take place on hospital-acquired infections, and that the federal government should establish a $10-million-a-year research fund for the next 10 years. The problems of hospital-acquired infections are &ldquo;diverse and complex,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But we have an abundance of evidence that a lot of it is preventable.&rdquo; Serratia marcescens has a strong history of involvement... I don't think the hospital has determined what caused... My sympathies to the grieving family. No one plans... I agree with dawson. I do not know about Mt Senai,...

Click me to Worse health outcomes for seniors who wait longer for hip surgery: study Anne-Marie Tobin, Canadian Press Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 TORONTO (CP) - Almost two-thirds of seniors who suffer a broken hip go under the knife within a day or two, and they tend to have better outcomes than those who wait longer for an operation, said a report released Wednesday. Overall, the study by the Canadian Institute for Health Information found that nearly 25,000 seniors were admitted to hospital in Canada in 2005-2006 with a broken hip. Hospitalizations for hip fractures were down 13 per cent from five years earlier. But the report found that eight per cent of seniors admitted to hospitals outside Quebec with hip fractures spent four or more days in hospital before having surgery. Those who had to wait longer than the next day for surgery were 22 per cent more likely to die in hospital within 30 days of admission. "We find that there is a group that we could perhaps do a better job on," said Dr. Michael Dunbar, an orthopedic surgeon in Halifax who routinely sees elderly patients showing up in hospital in "significant amounts of pain" after a fall. "We've identified some low-hanging fruit, a group that is waiting and subsequently is not having as good an outcome, particularly with respect to mortality. So it's an area where we could do better." Numerous factors can contribute to delays. Dunbar said they can occur because a patient has to be taken off blood-thinners before surgery, or may require a cardiac assessment first. Jennifer Zelmer, vice-president of research and analysis at CIHI, said the statistics were adjusted for these "patient factors," and the report revealed a number of other concerns related to wait times. "If you were transferred from one hospital to another, or if you're admitted to a larger hospital, or an afternoon or evening admit, or an admission on a weekday as opposed to a weekend, those patients were more likely to have their surgery later than others," said Zelmer, one of the authors of the report. The fact that surgery occurs more quickly when a person is admitted on a weekend might come as a surprise, but Zelmer said it has to do with the fact that someone is specifically on call on the weekend to handle trauma cases and can help a patient immediately. "Whereas on a weekday, they may be in the middle of a hip replacement, for example, or a scheduled surgery," she said. Dunbar agreed, noting that elective surgery isn't normally scheduled on weekends, so surgeons can start working on emergency cases such as fractured hips first thing in the morning. Broken hips are dealt with more quickly in small hospitals, the report found. "Seventy-four per cent, for example, got same day or next day surgery if they were admitted to a small hospital," Zelmer said. The number was 67 per cent for a medium or large community hospital, and 57 per cent for teaching hospitals. As for regional variations, those in Prince Edward Island, British Columbia and Nova Scotia were more likely to have surgery quickly, while patients in Manitoba and Saskatchewan were behind the national average.

Sounds totally sci-fi freaky, doesn&#39;t it? Sadly, it&#39;s dead serious and coming to a milk carton near you! It was one thing to to make them lower in carbohydrates a couple of years back. But what they&#39;re doing to cows just to artificially lower the fat content of their milk takes weird science to a whole new level! We have the New Zealand-based biotechnology company ViaLactia to thank for stumbling across almost by accident a cow they named Marge in 2001 which has a gene mutation allowing it to produce milk with 1% milk naturally rather than the 3.5% milk that traditional cows make for whole milk. This new low-fat milk produced by this one-of-a-kind cow supposedly has more omega-3 fats and the butter created from it is spreadable even when it&#39;s cold. Ooooooh!

But if you're like most, your number is woefully low when it comes to protecting your skin from sun damage and potentially skin cancer. Only 35% of the public scored above average on a recent American Academy of Dermatology national poll, which measured people's sun smarts. In Pictures: How Sun Smart Is Your City? The "Rays: Your Grade" survey polled 3,342 respondents, 50% men and 50% women, in 32 U.S. metropolitan regions covering 29 states during February. Locations were ranked based on residents' answers to 17 questions testing their knowledge, attitudes and behaviors regarding tanning and sun protection. Not surprisingly many of the high-ranking cities-- --feel the warmth of the sun year-round and have strong public awareness campaigns. But despite their more variable climates, topped the list in sun smarts. Dr. Sandra Read, former president of the Washington D.C. Dermatological Society and spokeswoman for the American Academy of Dermatology, said that's because the areas have highly educated and motivated patient populations. "They hear something on NPR while they're driving to my office," Read says, "and they say, 'Tell me about that.' " High-Performance Summer Sporting Gear Worst Cities For Spring Allergies The places at the bottom of the list--those determined to be the least sun savvy--include About 49% of Chicago residents said they believe that given their skin type they don't have to worry about sun exposure, and 59% said they thought getting a base tan is a healthy way to protect skin from sun damage. Neither is true. "My first line of defense is--if you lived in Chicago in our crazy weather, you'd want to be in the sun too," says Dr. Carolyn Jacob of Chicago Cosmetic Surgery and Dermatology and an associate clinical instructor in dermatology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Chicago is also a city full of young people who think, like many elsewhere, having a tan makes you look good, Jacob says. They just haven't seen the damage it's causing yet. Ask a dermatologist about the mistakes people make when it comes to protecting their skin from the sun and you'll get an earful. No matter where you live, they say, you've probably got some room for improvement. Dr. Joshua Fox, founder and director of Advanced Dermatology and The Center for Laser and Cosmetic Surgery in New York, says even before sunscreen the first step is avoiding the sun, particularly from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Instead of going to the beach at midday, why not wait until the late afternoon? And don't be fooled by talk about how avoiding the sun will lead to a vitamin D deficiency. Most people get more than enough vitamin D through their diets, but if not, a five-minute walk will do the trick, Jacob says. These healthy summer desserts will keep your taste buds happy and your waistline slim. If you are in the sun, wear protective clothing or at least hats and bathing suits with more rather than less coverage. Minnesota-based retailer Coolibar, for instance, sells clothing and with an ultraviolet protection factor of 50+, meaning they protect against ultraviolet A and ultraviolet B waves. To choose the right sunscreen, Dr. Coyle Connolly, president of New Jersey-based medical esthetic clinic Connolly Skin Care, recommends people see a dermatologist, who can suggest the best product for oily, dry or sensitive skin, and your lifestyle. Beyond checking the SPF value, look for a label that promises UVA protection since SPF indicates sun protection only from UVB rays. Good ingredients to look for include avobenzone, titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. Neutrogena has new products containing Helioplex, a complex that stabilizes avobenzone, which breaks down in sunlight. L'Oreal sells sunscreen made with Mexoryl SX, a filter that's protective against short UVA waves. And a number of sunscreens also now contain antioxidants, which can protect the body from the damaging effect free radicals, a byproduct of exposure to ultraviolet light. Whatever you choose, make sure you're applying a shot glass worth and reapplying about every two hours. Fox says your bottle should not last you the whole summer. People also commonly interpret a higher SPF to indicate more effective sun protection, when it only refers to how much longer you can withstand sun exposure vs. no protection. SPF values don't take into account the fact that you're sweating or wiping off sunscreen with a towel either. Dr. Arielle Kauvar, associate professor of dermatology at the New York University School of Medicine, says people should always wear a minimum of SPF 15 with UVA protection, no matter the climate, since UVA exposure is year-round. UVA rays cause 90% of the changes we identify as signs of aging, such as brown spots, dull and sagging skin, and wrinkles, Kauvar says. If you need a reason to avoid them, tanning salons are known for using beds that emit primarily UVA rays. "We're hoping if people aren't worried about skin cancer," she says, "at least they understand that this sun exposure is what's making them wrinkled." After The Damage Is Done There are steps you can take to care for your skin post-sunbathing. While there's no proof you'll be able to prevent melanoma, you might regenerate your skin's appearance. If your burn is fresh, experts recommend taking an anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen to help with the pain and avoiding sun exposure. Within a day, consider calling your dermatologist to see if it's possible to get a treatment like GentleWaves, which delivers low-intensity light energy to boost collagen and reduce sun damage, fine lines and wrinkles. In less than a minute an $80 to $150 application treats the whole face, says Dr. David McDaniel, director of the Institute of Anti-Aging Research in Virginia Beach, Va. After the fact, creams like can combat wrinkles and sun damaged skin, Jacob says. There are also prescription medications, such as Efudex, that can treat the earliest stages of squamous cell carcinoma, says Kauvar. Deep laser peels and microdermabrasion are other options. The key is to talk to your doctor, and while you're at it, get a skin examination once a year. More than 54% of the adults surveyed by the American Academy of Dermatology said they'd never been screened for skin cancer by a health care provider. And if you keep spending time in the sun, don't be surprised by the results. "If you're swimming with sharks," Connolly says, "you'll get bit every now and then."

Schmidt-Wolf, M.D. Laurence Moore, M.D., Ph.D. Robert J. Motzer, M.D. the Global ARCC Trial Interferon alfa is widely used for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma but has limited efficacy and tolerability. Temsirolimus, a specific inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase, may benefit patients with this disease. In this multicenter, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned 626 patients with previously untreated, poor-prognosis metastatic renal-cell carcinoma to receive 25 mg of intravenous temsirolimus weekly, 3 million U of interferon alfa (with an increase to 18 million U) subcutaneously three times weekly, or combination therapy with 15 mg of temsirolimus weekly plus 6 million U of interferon alfa three times weekly. The primary end point was overall survival in comparisons of the temsirolimus group and the combination-therapy group with the interferon group. Patients who received temsirolimus alone had longer overall survival (hazard ratio for death, 0.73; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58 to 0.92; P=0.008) and progression-free survival Overall survival in the combination-therapy group did not differ significantly from that in the interferon group (hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.76 to 1.20; P=0.70). Median overall survival times in the interferon group, the temsirolimus group, and the combination-therapy group were 7.3, 10.9, and 8.4 months, respectively. Rash, peripheral edema, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia were more common in the temsirolimus group, whereas asthenia was more common in the interferon group. There were fewer patients with serious adverse events in the temsirolimus group than in the interferon group (P=0.02). As compared with interferon alfa, temsirolimus improved overall survival among patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma and a poor prognosis. The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival.

"Using a water pipe to smoke tobacco is not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking," the U.N. health agency said in a seven-page document on the practice. "Contrary to ancient lore and popular belief, the smoke that emerges from a water pipe contains numerous toxicants known to cause lung cancer, heart disease and other diseases." The WHO "advisory note" warned using water pipes to consume the tobacco usually exposes a person to more smoke over a longer period of time than do cigarettes. Preliminary research suggests hookah smoking poses many of the same dangers as cigarettes and may involve "some unique health risks," the agency said. A hookah is a bowl connected to a vase of water with a long tube and mouthpiece. The tobacco sits inside the bowl with a layer of foil and a hot coal on top. The tobacco is never lit, instead heated by the charcoal, which smokers say produces a vapor different from smoke. The hookah, used for centuries in North Africa, the Middle East and Central and South Asia, has become increasingly popular in the United States, Europe and Brazil, particularly among college students and young adults. WHO says the trend is partly due to "unfounded assumptions" of its safety, and misleading commercial marketing.

Scientists in New Zealand report they've found a genetic mutation that causes some cows to produce healthier, lower-fat milk. &#40;Justin Sullivan/Getty Images&#41; WELLINGTON, New Zealand May 28, 2007 (AP) New Zealand scientists are breeding a herd of cows that produce lower-fat milk after the chance discovery of a natural gene mutation in one animal. Milk from the cows is also high in health-boosting omega-3 fatty acids and makes butter that spreads as easily as margarine even when chilled, biotechnology company Vialactia said Monday. Heart Attack Relief? The Truth About Omega-3 Omega-3 fatty acids linked to denser bones in men Making Fats Good for You Scientists discovered a cow, later named Marge by researchers, carrying the mutant gene in a dairy herd they were testing in 2001, Vialactia chief scientist Russell Snell said. Vialactia, a subsidiary of the Fonterra Cooperative Group, one of the world's largest milk companies, bought the cow for 300 New Zealand dollars ($218) and moved it to a research site. While she looked like any other Friesian cow, testing revealed that Marge's milk contained about 1 percent fat, compared with about 3.5 percent for whole milk. Offspring from the cow also produce low-fat milk, showing the genetic trait is dominant, Snell said. Scientists have yet to isolate the exact chemical pathway responsible for the naturally produced low-fat milk, Snell said. "Every now and then nature throws up these sorts of things and it was simply a case of us being in the right place at the right time," he said. The company expects the first commercial herd of cows supplying natural low-fat milk and spreadable butter for the market by 2011. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

People exposed to low levels of pesticides had a 13 per cent higher risk of developing the disease, and those exposed to high levels a 41 per cent greater risk, researchers from Aberdeen University found." /> Pesticides increase Parkinson&rsquo;s risk-Life & Style-Health-TimesOnline Our exclusive four-step guide to giving up before the ban Navigation - link to other main sections from here No wonder I'll die alone. All I do is ask questions Pesticides increase Parkinson&rsquo;s risk Nigel Hawkes, Health Editor The risk of developing Parkinson&rsquo;s disease is increased by exposure to pesticides, a study has found. People exposed to low levels of pesticides had a 13 per cent higher risk of developing the disease, and those exposed to high levels a 41 per cent greater risk, researchers from Aberdeen University found. The researchers compared the lifetime experiences of almost 1,000 Parkinson&rsquo;s sufferers with almost 2,000 unaffected people in Scotland, Italy, Sweden, Romania and Malta. The method did not establish which pesticides the sufferers had been exposed to, as most of them could not provide such information. Being knocked out in a boxing ring or suffering an accident that causes unconsciousness is even likelier to bring on Parkinson&rsquo;s. Those who had suffered a single knockout had a 35 per cent greater chance of developing the disease, while those who had been knocked out more than once more than doubled their risk. Country walk made my illness worse The boxer Muhammad Ali, three times heavyweight champion of the world, suffers from Parkinson&rsquo;s syndrome &mdash; a related condition &mdash; which most medical experts believe was caused by his experiences in the ring. The latest study, by the European Commission, aimed to identify factors that can accelerate or cause the disease. The results are published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Kieran Breen, director of research and development for the Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Society, said that the findings reinforced the belief that the disease was caused by more than one factor. He said: &ldquo;The association between pesticides and Parkinson&rsquo;s has been recognised for some time. The results of this study compound the results of a 2006 study of 147,000 people, conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health, which also found the incidence of Parkinson&rsquo;s to be slightly higher in people who reported previous exposure to pesticides.&rdquo; Georgina Downs, of the UK Pesticides Campaign, said that it was not surprising that study after study linked pesticides to chronic neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. &ldquo;This study has found that the risk of developing Parkinson&rsquo;s disease increases according to the level of exposure to pesticides,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This is highly significant in relation to the long-term exposure of rural residents living near sprayed fields.&rdquo; She said that it would be difficult to establish which pesticides were responsible as they are rarely used one at a time. The European Commission said last year that long-term exposure to pesticides could lead to serious disturbances to the immune system, as well as sexual disorders and cancers. &mdash; Parkinson&rsquo;s is a progressive brain condition &mdash; Symptoms include tremors, limb rigidity, slow movement and balance and coordination problems &mdash;These are caused by the loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells in the brain &mdash; Parkinson&rsquo;s does not in itself kill, but it can hasten death from other causes I was a cartographic surveyor. I worked mostly outside and in mainly rural areas, more often in farming areas in the northern half of Scotland. I retired in 1996 on a voluntary redundancy scheme at the age of 56. I was diagnosed as having Parkinson's Disease in January 2005, although clearly I had had it for longer. I wonder if I may fall in the category as described by the article on this latest research? John Skipworth, PERTH, Scotland I know a man who has suffered terribly from Parkinsons for about ten years, and he is about 60. Now one of his workmates (they were apprenticed together) has contracted a different form of the illness. They both worked in joinery & construction. Perhaps a solvent could be responsible. G also did some agricultural work, so organo phosphates are another possibility (ie from sheep dip). Surely someone must have collated occupations of people with the illness? Carbon tetrachloride was another well known brain-killer. Tim C, Southern England, so the overwhelming majority of parkinsons sufferers are farmers then? This is very interesting for me as my brother in law died two years ago from parkinson related problems. He was an artist and in particular a stage designer who over a long period of time used solvents to create stage sets as models. Maybe there is a connection between these products and the disease. Perhaps the wearing of a mask is not sufficient protection?

On the other hand, waiting to see if the pain goes away on its own won&#39;t affect the outcome of surgery if you decide to have an operation later on, a second study found. Both of the studies, published in the May 31 New England Journal of Medicine , compared surgical treatment of back and leg pain (sciatica) caused by disc herniation or a condition called lumbar degenerative spondylolisthesis, which occurs when one vertebra in the back slips forward onto another. "Not all pain -- whether back or sciatic -- can be appropriately managed with surgery, but if it is something that can be helped with surgery, like these two conditions, surgery can provide a more prompt relief of pain and return to function," said Dr. Jeffrey Spivak, director of the New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases Spine Center in New York City. He was not involved in the studies. Another outside expert agreed. Dr. Dante Implicito, chief of spine surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center said that not all people with back pain need surgery. "Many patients are treated conservatively," he said. An accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal pointed out that 75 percent of people with sciatica pain see improvement in their symptoms within three months, even without surgery. However, Implicito pointed out that conservative treatment or a wait-and-see approach isn&#39;t always practical. Some people are in so much pain, they can&#39;t function or may be in danger of losing their jobs if they can&#39;t get back to work, so they opt for surgery sooner rather than later even though they might eventually get better on their own. "These studies show that there can be tremendous improvement if patients are selected well for surgery," he said. The first study, done in the Netherlands, included 283 people who had severe sciatica -- leg pain caused by a compressed nerve in the spine -- for at least six to 12 weeks prior to the start of the study. Half of the group was selected to undergo early surgery -- an average of 2.2 weeks into the study; while the other half was chosen to receive conservative treatment with the option of surgery at a later date. Thirty-nine percent of the conservative treatment group eventually decided to have surgery, and the average time from the start of the study to the surgery was 18.7 weeks. The researchers found there wasn&#39;t much difference in disability between the two groups, but that those who had early surgery reported faster pain relief than the conservative treatment group. "The time scheme of recovering was different, with a faster recovery after early surgery," said the study&#39;s lead author, Dr. Wilco Peul, a neurosurgeon at Leiden University Medical Center. "Fifty percent of patients [in the early surgery group] were recovered in 4 weeks after randomization, whereas prolonged conservative care would need 12 weeks before 50 percent were recovered." "I would recommend to wait a little longer and delay the decision to perform surgery until three to six months after the start of leg pain. If, however, sciatica pain does not allow you to work or care for yourself or your family, early surgery remains a very good option and is safe," said Peul. The second study included a little more than 600 people with degenerative spondylolisthesis, a condition more common in older people, and for reasons that aren&#39;t clear, black women. Half of the patients were randomly selected to undergo surgery, the majority of whom had spinal fusion, a procedure in which two vertebra are fused together. The other half was to receive standard non-surgical care. However, many in the non-surgical group decided to have surgery, so the researchers had to adjust the study data, because the results were no longer randomized. They found that after three months, and again at one year, people who had the surgical procedure had less pain and a greater improvement in function than those who didn&#39;t have surgery. "These studies allow us to make better conclusions about the treatment options available for patients," said Spivak. "Surgery is not the end answer for all pain problems, especially back pain. There have to be specific reasons to operate. In my practice, of all the surgical referrals I see, only about one in three end up getting surgery," Spivak said. But, for those with disc herniation or spondylolisthesis, these studies confirm that surgery can be an effective alternative, and that even if you wait to have surgery, "you wouldn&#39;t have lost anything in terms of your chances of doing well," he said. Implicito emphasized that the most important thing someone with back pain can do is see a specialist with as much specific training in back problems as possible. "Back pain comes in a lot of different &#39;flavors&#39;, you need to be evaluated and diagnosed by a very well-trained person so you know what&#39;s relevant to your condition."

World observes No Tobacco Day Washington, May 31: Tobacco is the second major cause of deaths worldwide. Half of the people who smoke regularly today  about 650 million  will eventually die of tobacco-related diseases. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that around 700 million children, or almost half of the worlds children, breathe air that is polluted by tobacco smoke, particularly in their homes. The International Labor Organization (ILO) says that at least 200,000 workers die every year due to exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. There is no known safe level of human exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke, which causes cancer as well as serious respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in children and adults that lead to death. This years World No Tobacco Day focuses on 100 percent Smoke-Free Environments as the only measure to protect people, especially women and children, and people in the workplace, from exposure to second hand tobacco smoke. Health experts stress that neither ventilation nor filtration  alone or in combination  can reduce exposure to tobacco smoke indoors to levels that are considered safe or acceptable. World No Tobacco Day is observed around the world on May 31 each year. In 1987, the World Health Assembly  the supreme decision-making body of the WHO  passed a resolution calling for April 7, 1988, to be "a world no smoking day." In 1988, another resolution was passed designating May 31 every year as World No Tobacco Day. As we observe World No Tobacco Day this year, we draw public attention to the "tobacco epidemic" and the preventable diseases and deaths it causes, and to the campaign to help reduce the millions of preventable deaths from tobacco-related health illnesses by campaigning for a smoke-free environment in our homes, communities, schools, and workplaces. The right to clean air  free from tobacco smoke  is a human right; most people are non-smokers and have the right not to be exposed to other peoples smoke. Cigarette smoking is dangerous to your (and other peoples) health. Quit smoking and live longer. *Your friend's e-mail address: How the brain hears shapes?

In a new drive against obesity, the EU's top public health official Markos Kyprianou unveiled a new fat-fighting strategy paper in Brussels on Wednesday. To the experts, it may not go far enough. The emphasis is firmly on self-regulation, with Kyprianou "encouraging" food companies to provide consumers with full information about the health risks associated with their products. He also urged the food industry to cut down on sugar, fat and salt, and said sports organizations should do more to get youngsters to engage in physical exercise. Ideally, he said he hoped the industry would act voluntarily, but stressed that a review in 2010 would decide whether new laws were needed. Without increased information available to consumers, he said, the possibility of setting tougher advertising and labeling rules on companies could not be ruled out. "What consumers eat is up to them, but they should be able to make informed choices, and have a range of healthy options to choose from," said the EU Health Commissioner. "That is why the Commission is reviewing the options for nutrition labeling, and calling on industry to advertise responsibly and reduce levels of salt, fats and sugar in food products." Piling on the pounds Getting the kids away from the computers and on to the beach The anti-obesity push comes in response to growing evidence that Europeans are getting fatter. Over half are now estimated to be obese or overweight. According to the World Health Organization, obesity rates have more than trebled since the 1980s in many European countries, with children particularly at risk. Over 21 million are now classified as obese. "We have to acknowledge the fact that children don't entertain themselves any more through physical activity," he said, adding that they needed to be "reintroduced" to sport. "If we don't act, today's overweight children will be tomorrow's heart attack victims," said Kyprianou, who also pointed out that diets based on fatty and sweet ingredients combined with lack of physical activity account for six of the seven top factors leading to poor health. "The numbers are frightening," he stressed. Gro&szlig;ansicht des Bildes mit der Bildunterschrift: Will Europe really change its eating habits? The EU Commission has long been telling governments to act, but the statistics show the warnings have been in vain. "Everybody has to be blamed -- including the authorities, including the industry, including the consumers," Kyprianou said. Overall, consumption of fruit and vegetables in the EU is lower than medical recommendations. The intake of fat and saturated fats is high throughout the continent, while the consumption of cereals has fallen by a quarter since the 1960s in Europe. Amounting to 7 percent of the total EU budget for healthcare, the cost of obesity could also do with shedding some weight. But without tough legislation, many believe the obesity problem will continue to balloon. European consumer organization BEUC were among those expressing disappointment with Brussels' plans. "Like many slimming regimes, the white paper is built on false hopes and unrealistic expectations," said BEUC chief Jim Murray.

T.O. neonatal unit shut after infection kills baby Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 9:06 AM ET The neonatal intensive care unit at a downtown Toronto hospital has been shut down after a premature baby died from a highly feared bacterial infection, according to a newspaper report. The infant died of bacteremia, commonly known as blood poisoning, at Mount Sinai Hospital, said the hospital's director of infection control Dr. Allison McGeer. She said the blood poisoning occurred after the baby acquired serratia, a harmful pathogen that can cause severe infections in babies. "This is one of the organisms we really worry about it," McGeer told The Globe and Mail. "... This is not an organism you take any chances with." The infant, weighing between one and three pounds, died over the weekend. "It is so awful for new parents, such a tragedy that these babies die," said McGeer. "It's also extremely hard on the staff who work in the unit because every one of those babies is their baby, too." A second baby also tested positive for serratia, which can lead to pneumonia, meningitis and bacteremia infections. The infant is in isolation at the hospital but is not seriously ill. The death has prompted the hospital to impose special infection control procedures, including improved hand hygiene and mandatory gowns and gloves in the neonatal intensive care unit. The hospital's level 3 neonatal unit remained closed Wednesday night but level 2 was reopened on Wednesday afternoon. The neonatal ward is currently operating at maximum capacity and the hospital has plans to expand the space in order to prevent sick infants from being in close proximity. To minimize infection, experts recommend incubators be placed at least 10 feet apart. The Mount Sinai incubators are currently placed four to five feet apart. According to Dick Zoutman, physician director of the Community and Hospital Infection Control Association of Canada, hospital-acquired infections are the fourth leading cause of death among patients. Zoutman told the newspaper between 8,000 and 12,000 Canadians die from hospital-acquired infections every year.

Dutch couple may have injected dozens with HIV more articles by Gus Cairns Four HIV positive men from Groeningen province in the north of the Netherlands, in a sensational case, have confessed to the police that they held sex parties where they drugged men with GHB and injected them with their own blood in an attempt to infect them. Dutch HIV workers told Gay.com that they were aware that at least 10 men who attended the sex parties had contracted HIV  which implies that considerably more men were victims of the assaults. The accused are two 48-year old men from Slochteren and two men from Groeningen aged 33 and 34. Two have confessed to the sexual assault and deliberate infection attempts: the other two have so far only admitted to dealing in huge quantities of GHB. One does not define as gay. Five victims between the ages of 25 and 50 have reported to the police so far and four of them have filed charges. The Dutch public prosecutor has charged the men with premeditated grievous bodily harm, but said it could not charge them with attempted murder or manslaughter because the life expectancy of the victims can be extended with medication. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 16 years in prison. Gay.com spoke to Robert Witlox, Director of the Dutch HIV Association, who takes up the story. We became aware that something odd was going on in Groeningen about a year ago. Someone came to a support group for people newly diagnosed with HIV and gave us this story about having been drugged unconscious with GHB and raped, which was how he got the virus. At first we dismissed it  you hear many such stories in support groups  but several other people came forward with similar stories. One said he had come to to find a man still fucking him without a condom while another said that during the experience he had felt a sharp needle-like pain in his anus. The suspects have confessed that they took syringes of blood missed from all four of them and injected them into their victims anuses. Witlox continues: The men would advertise small sex parties  3-5 people - on the internet. It appears they were doing it on a frequent basis, and it continued right up till they were arrested in May. We alerted the public health department in Groeningen who said they had heard similar stories. They put out a press release warning gay men warning gay men about attending sex parties and saying they had noticed a rise in local HIV infections. We finally persuaded the first victim  who does not publicly identify as gay  to make a formal complaint to the police in January. Witlox commented that one of the features of the case was that the victims appeared largely to be non-gay-identified men seeking bisexual thrills on the internet. The two who have made confessions to the police said that they were motivated by lust and because if they made other men positive theyd have the opportunity to have unprotected sex with them. Witlox comments: In many ways this is a straightforward case. The legal argument about HIV transmission has always been about reckless infection, (i.e. not meaning to infect, but not caring either), whereas this is a clear case of rape and of attempted deliberate infection. Judging by the confessions, the accused must have had psychiatric problems around having HIV. In talking to the media yesterday, not just myself but also representatives from the Dutch Health Ministry said that this behaviour was not typical of gay men or people with HIV. Witlox added, however, that since then his organisation has been accused of fostering a culture of normalising unsafe sex. Journalists are now linking the case with the fact that we have a support group called Positive and Proud where subjects like serosorting (i.e. consensual unprotected sex between HIV positive people) are discussed. Weve been asked if we have any norms. Weve said: Yes, we do; were saying its not alright to rape people and deliberately infect them with HIV! Image courtesy of the excellent &copy;1995-2007 PLANETOUT INC.

Anne Kyle, Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post Published:Â Thursday, May 31, 2007 REGINA -- Saskatchewan has the second-highest hip fracture hospitalization rates in the country, and according to a new study those patients have some of the longest waits for surgery. The proportion of hip fracture patients in Saskatchewan who had surgery on the same day or the day after admission to hospital, at 56 per cent, is the secondlowest in Canada, behind Manitoba, the Canadian Institute of Health Information's (CIHI) Health Indicators 2007 report noted. The availability of hospital beds and the time it takes to stabilize and transfer patients between hospitals contribute to the longer waits for service, said Deborah Jordan, Saskatchewan Health's executive director of the acute and emergency services branch. Email to a friend "When you consider in Saskatchewan that hip fractures would most typically be repaired by orthopedic surgeons, there are really only four centres in Saskatchewan that have that capacity," Jordan said. While national hospitalization rates for hip fractures are down 13 per cent from fi ve years ago, 70 seniors a day were admitted to Canadian hospitals with broken hips in 2005-06, according to the CIHI report which was released on Wednesday. Saskatchewan averaged 600 hip fracture hospitalizations per 100,000 population compared to the Canadian average of 502 per 100,000. Saskatchewan is about average compared to the rest of Canada (0.8 per 1,000 population) in in-hospital hip fractures; however, Saskatoon has a higher than average inhospital hip fracture rate at 1.3 per 1,000 population. The CIHI report also found that in 2005-06 almost two-thirds of seniors who broke their hips got surgery by the second day of admission to hospital in Canada. But eight per cent of Canadian seniors with broken hips, about 1,400 patients, lie languishing in a hospital bed for four or more days awaiting surgery. "This is important new information, because evidence suggests that hip fracture patients who have surgery sooner tend to have better health outcomes," Jennifer Zelmer, CIHI's vice-president of research and analysis, said in a prepared statement. The report provides a starting point for the province, which is working with the Saskatchewan Surgical Care Network to meet the pan-Canadian benchmark, which is providing surgery within 48 hours of the time the patient is ready to treat, she said. The CIHI report noted that of the 17,000 seniors who underwent surgery to repair broken hips in hospitals outside of Quebec, 1,000 died in hospital within a month of admission. The study ties longer waits for hip surgery with higher death rates and longer, often more painful, recovery in hospital. The death rate for patients who waited longer for surgery was 22 per cent higher than for those treated on the day of admission to hospital or the next day. "Certainly the goal of ensuring that people get more timely care for hip fracture is to try and prevent any of the other complications that might ensue with the wait," Jordan said. While good progress is being made in the treatment of broken hips, more emphasis needs to be placed on helping to prevent falls, which are one of the leading causes of hip fractures among seniors, she said.

Though many scientists have cautioned that it's too soon to link cancers to toxins at the site, doctors at Mount Sinai's World Trade Center medical monitoring program are now seeing surprising cases of plasma-cell cancers in people who were there, said Dr. Robin Herbert. "We know we have a handful of cases of multiple myeloma in very young individuals, and multiple myeloma is a condition that almost always presents later in life, so that's the kind of odd, unusual and troubling finding that we're seeing already," Herbert said in an online audio interview in advance of today's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Doctors at Mount Sinai are trying to verify cases of leukemia and lymphoma reported by any of the more than 20,000 responders they've examined, she said. More than 120 people with those cancers are part of a class-action lawsuit alleging negligence by the city and its contractors at Ground Zero, said lawyer David Worby. "People are afraid of the C-word, cancer. It's taken hundreds of people getting sick this way for Mount Sinai to say, 'We are more than concerned,'" Worby said. "Washington and Mount Sinai should draw up an entire platform of blood tests and precancer tests." Herbert was unavailable for an interview, but in the Journal she described three waves of post-9/11 illnesses. The first was the stubborn, dry "World Trade Center cough" stemming from pulverized cement there and seen in the months just after the disaster. The second wave involves chronic respiratory diseases that cause lung inflammation and scarring. Cancers could be the third wave among responders exposed to asbestos, dioxins and other carcinogens at Ground Zero, Herbert said. Although the "full range" of those toxins will never be known, "you really worry when you have a mix of chemicals about the possibility of [a] synergistic effect," she said.

Sixty healthy postmenopausal women were randomized in a crossover design to a TLC diet including 25 g/d of non-soy protein, or a TLC diet of similar energy, fat, and protein content in which soy nuts (containing 25 g/d of soy protein and 101 mg of aglycone isoflavones) replaced non-soy protein. Compared to the non-soy TLC diet, the TLC diet with soy nuts lowered systolic and diastolic BP 9.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, in hypertensive women, and 5.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in normotensive women. Further, BPs of normotensive women were lowered 5.5 percent and 2.7 percent, respectively, in prehypertensive women, and 4.5 percent and 3.0 percent, respectively, in normotensive women. Soy nut supplementation lowered LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels 11 percent and 8 percent, respectively, in hypertensive women, but had no effect in normotensive women. These data further support the cardioprotective effects of soy. LycoRed: Providing Innovative Solutions for Cutting-Edge Development to see what the buzz was about at Supply Side East.

Parents and schools, major factors in China obesity boom Buy best Obesity products from Amazon Obesity :: Parents and schools, major factors in China obesity boom Childhood obesity is widely recognised as a major contributor towards cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, sleep disorders, and psychological and social problems. The China National Nutrition and Health survey in 2002 revealed that the prevalence of overweight individuals has increased overall by 39% in the past ten years. In Xi'an City, where the new study was conducted, 20% of the adolescents were found to be overweight, a rate similar to that observed in many western countries. In a recent report in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers found the following factors were significantly associated with overweight and obesity in children included:living in urban districtslimited use of sports facilities in schoolswealthier householdshaving an obese/overweight parenthaving soft drink >4 times a week and not being fussy about foods. Co-author of the research, Dr Ming Li, Research Fellow, at The George Institute for International Health in Sydney, explained that these risk factors should guide the future development of evidence-based and cost-effective strategies to tackle this increasing public health problem in China. Dr Li said that "Predictors of excess weight and obesity are widely acknowledged as heredity, lifestyle and environmental factors. However, these factors need to be viewed more closely, as they are greatly influenced by parents in a family, teachers at school, which are embedded in a community, and social context." "Strategies that target socio-economic and behavioural factors alone do not seem to be effective in the long-term and are simply not sufficient. A stronger focus on community, school and household environments is vital to reduce the growing obesity epidemic. This is particularly important for a society that is undergoing such a massive nutritional transition," she noted. The published research recommends that obesity intervention programs should include:coordinated government policy-making for infrastructure development and food supply;involvement of schools in the development of curriculum and school policies; andfamily involvement, with a parenting approach that fosters a healthy lifestyle for children at the early stage of their life, to benefit them for the whole of their life. Dr Li highlights the associated factors at the school level, such as the hours spent in class versus physical activity: "Chinese students spend around 8-9 hours a day at school. Obesity prevention strategies should really include the need to adjust school curricula to increase the opportunity for physical activity during the school day. Limited use of school sports facilities increased the risk of obesity by 70%." "In addition, adolescents were more likely to be overweight or obese in urban and suburban areas, due to increased passive transport to school, easy access to fast food and also students in these areas are more likely to spend more time doing homework and have less physical activity." Dr Li added. Parental control of "snacking" was reported to be strongly associated with adolescent obesity, especially in boys. "Parent's expression of nurturing emotion with clear communication and realistic behavioural expectations is imperative in a child's development and healthy behaviour. It provides motivation for the child, allows the parents to help establish healthy behaviours and reinforces self-regulation, thereby allowing the child to develop new and healthy activities," Dr Li noted. Unlike findings from western countries, higher parental education was associated with overweight and obesity in adolescents. Eating and exercise behaviours can be shaped and cultivated by good family habits based on the parents' knowledge and practice.

The research was done at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Francine K. Welty led the study and put 60 healthy post-menopausal women to the test with the soy nuts. They had them eat two diets for eight weeks each. One diet had soy nuts, the other protein. The researchers found that those who ate the soy nuts had a lower blood pressure as well a cholesterol level. It lowered blood pressure by about 10%. Cholesterol was also lowered by about 11%. The conclusion by the researchers was that &#8220;This study was performed in the free-living state; therefore, dietary soy may be a practical, safe and inexpensive modality to reduce blood pressure. If the findings are repeated in a larger group they may have important implications for reducing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women on a population basis.&#8221; Cocoa Lowers Blood Pressure Better Than Tea Chocolate Helps Lower Blood Pressure Study: Cocoa May Lower Blood Pressure High Blood Pressured Caused By Brain Painkillers Cause High Blood Pressure instead of Internet Explorer and PREVENT Spyware! and is considered the best free, safe web browser E Canada Now - Breaking News Copyright 2006-2007 Dedicated Servers by FastServers.net Other Sections Of eCanadaNow

Jump to main content Space telescope spies dark matter United Nations' AIDS programme under fire Static holes defy theory Deadly TB strain flies around the world Silicon crystal cooked to perfection Published online: 30 May 2007; | doi:10.1038/news070528-6 United Nations' AIDS programme under fire Authors accuse agency of putting politics before health. The growth of better-funded projects has triggered an identity crisis at UNAIDS. Two new books are forcing the United Nations' AIDS programme to defend itself against claims that politics have distorted its mission. In one, Berkeley epidemiologist James Chin argues that the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has overestimated the potential size of the AIDS pandemic. That way, Chin says, the agency can claim credit when actual infection rates are lower than the projections. In the second, writer Helen Epstein says that UNAIDS has dodged the issue of sexual behaviour in Africa. Although reducing number of sexual partners can slow the spread of HIV, Epstein says UNAIDS has shied away from this message for political and cultural reasons. Some praise the books for providing much-needed scrutiny of UNAIDS. In a book review published today in , Stephen Lewis, former UN special envoy for AIDS in Africa, calls them "liberating" (see ' Time for a change? And the University of Ottawa's Amir Attaran says the United Nations has a general problem with book-keeping. The United Nations has set a series of targets called the Millennium Development Goals, which call for improvements such as reducing HIV infection, child mortality and poverty by 2015. But Attaran alleges the United Nations has failed to properly measure progress towards these goals, rendering them all but meaningless. "It's got to be the greatest swindle in all of development," Attaran says. Other observers defend UNAIDS against the claim of distorting data. The crux of Chin's argument is that UNAIDS epidemiologists have erred by surveying pregnant women for HIV infection at prenatal clinics, then extrapolating to the general population. More recent surveys of HIV in the general population have prompted UNAIDS to lower its estimates in some African and Asian countries. But those who participate in the process say this was never about politics, but more about adapting calculations to the available data. And, they add, UNAIDS has always said that data from different methods aren't directly comparable. "It has always been a data-based, not a political process," says Tim Brown, an epidemiologist at the East-West Center in Honolulu who collaborates with UNAIDS. "The epidemiology team at UNAIDS has gone out of its way to stress that data can only be interpreted in terms of trends based on the same methodology," he says. UNAIDS also says that it has long emphasized the value of reducing the number of sexual partners, including in a 2005 document, "Intensifying HIV Prevention". Some observers support the claim. "As far as I am aware, reducing partner numbers has been a prevention message for the past 20 years," says Geoff Garnett at Imperial College London, which coordinates the UNAIDS Epidemiology Reference Group. The broader picture behind the criticisms is that UNAIDS is searching for relevance. The agency was formed a decade ago to focus attention on the disease when there was little international funding or political commitment to fight it. Now, huge entities such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) are pouring unprecedented resources into the problem. Leadership has largely shifted to these bodies and away from UNAIDS, which is hampered by bureaucratic constraints and a smaller budget. That makes UNAIDS a relatively soft target, some say. "UNAIDS is easy to shoot at, because they don't have a lot of money compared with donors such as PEPFAR and the Global Fund," says Chris Beyrer, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, Maryland. "What are they supposed to do? They're not an enormously powerful entity." But that begs the question of what to expect from UNAIDS in the future. With little money and clout, the agency must find a way to deal with its identity crisis. Additional reporting by Emma Marris to read and post comments about this story.

USA TODAY On Politics Democrats duel over health care By Jill Lawrence, USA TODAY WASHINGTON &#151; A health care overhaul proposed Tuesday by Illinois Sen. Barack Obama underscores the central role the issue is playing in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Obama, New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and former North Carolina senator John Edwards have laid out plans to expand and modernize U.S. health care, while New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson has suggested ways to build on existing coverage. There is no comparable intramural competition on the Republican side. Candidate calls for universal health care The Democrats' offerings are "a big tactical change" from 2004, says Ken Thorpe, head of the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta. Those proposals, he says, were "very incremental." Like Edwards, Obama would require that all children be covered and all businesses either offer health benefits or help pay for them. However, Obama does not require individuals to buy coverage. Such a mandate, similar to laws saying people must buy car insurance, is central to the plan Edwards unveiled in February. Some policy analysts say it's crucial to achieving universal coverage. "You can't get to covering everyone without some sort of requirement," says Chris Jennings, a former Clinton administration health aide who is now an unpaid adviser to Hillary Clinton. Her policy director, Neera Tanden, meanwhile, called Obama's program "incentives" and said "in addition to making health care more accessible, we have to achieve true universal health care." Obama said Tuesday in Iowa City that the nation can achieve universal coverage "with the health care plan I'm outlining today." Spokesman Dan Pfeiffer said Obama expects the plan to cover everyone but will do "whatever turns out to be necessary" if it is implemented and that is not the case. Clinton last week discussed how she would make health care less expensive and said she would address quality and coverage in later speeches. In the Senate, she is trying to expand children's health insurance. The complex reform plan Clinton oversaw in 1993-94 when she was first lady did not require people to buy coverage. Now, however, that mandate is part of a Massachusetts law signed last year by then-governor Mitt Romney, now a Republican presidential candidate. California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, also a Republican, is pushing a similar idea. So far there is no health focus by Romney or other GOP presidential candidates, reflecting the priorities of Republican voters. In a USA TODAY/Gallup Poll in January, 59% of Democrats but only 40% of Republicans said it was "extremely important" that the president and Congress deal with health care. Obama says his plan would save "typical" families up to $2,500 a year; Clinton says hers would save up to $2,200. The Obama campaign said the difference is Obama would reimburse businesses for some of the costs of catastrophic-illness coverage on the condition the money be used to lower workers' premiums. Obama says his plan would cost the federal government $50 billion to $65 billion, after savings from such steps as better preventive care, better management of chronic diseases, negotiating lower drug prices and a transition to electronic patient records and other technology. He would spend $10 billion a year for five years on technology upgrades. Clinton has outlined similar ways to reduce costs. She would devote $3 billion a year to the high-tech transition and require all insurance companies that do business with the government to cover preventive care. She also proposes a "Best Practices Institute" to study what works best. There is no overall cost estimate for her plan because she hasn't announced all the details yet. The Edwards plan would cost $90 billion to $120 billion a year. Noteworthy aspects include its mandate and, for those who don't have insurance through their jobs, a choice of private plans or a government plan modeled on Medicare. Edwards and Obama would end some tax cuts for well-off Americans to offset the cost of their health care programs. Edwards has not offered as much detail as Obama or Clinton on cutting health care costs. Thorpe, who analyzed some health care numbers for Obama and Edwards, says Edwards "could probably get to the same (price) range" as Obama by backing similar cost-cutting measures &#8212; but "he'd have to add a whole new piece to his proposal" to lay them out. Edwards spokesman Eric Schultz said Edwards "has an aggressive plan" to cut costs. To report corrections and clarifications, contact Reader Editor By Charlie Neibergall, AP Democratic Sen.

May. 30 2007 10:54 AM ET Most Canadian seniors who break their hips are able to get surgery on the same day, or the day after, they are admitted to hospital. But eight per cent have to wait four days or longer, putting them at risk of complications and even death. The Canadian Institute for Health Information, in its annual Health Indicators 2007 report, says that in 2005-2006 about 17,000 surgeries were performed in Canada to repair hip fractures on patients aged 65 and older, in hospitals outside of Quebec. About six per cent of these patients, about 1,000, died in hospital within 30 days of admission. CIHI found that the mortality risk for patients who waited four days or longer for surgery was 22 per cent higher than for those treated on the day of admission to hospital or the next day. The results were calculated after accounting for other factors that affect mortality, such as age and other health problems. "Hip fractures represent a tremendous health burden for seniors. Recovery is often slow and painful, and many patients experience a loss of mobility and other health problems," says Dr. Michael Dunbar, associate professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Dalhousie University. Research has shown that hip fracture patients who have surgery to repair a broken hip sooner tend to have better health outcomes. Those who wait longer are more likely to have longer stays in hospital and often have more difficulty recovering. CIHI's report found that patients who underwent hip fracture surgery on the day they were admitted to hospital or the next day spent an average of 18.5 days in hospital after surgery. Those who waited longer spent an average of 20.5 days in hospital after surgery. How quickly patients are able to receive surgery for hip fracture surgery varies across the country, CIHI said. In 2005-2006, patients were more likely than the overall average (65 per cent) to have surgery on the day of admission or the next day in Prince Edward Island (78 per cent); British Columbia (71 per cent); and Nova Scotia (69 per cent). Patients in Manitoba (53 per cent) and Saskatchewan (56 per cent) were less likely to do so. Patients are less likely to have surgery on the day of admission or the next day if they have to be transferred to another hospital for care; if they are admitted to a larger community or teaching hospital; if they are admitted in the afternoon or evening; or if they are admitted on a weekday. The primary risk factors for hip fractures are osteoporosis, low physical activity, multiple medication use, as well as a senior's physical surroundings, says Greg Webster, CIHI's director of research and indicator development.

Agus, MD; Emeritus Professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. Additional Parkinson's Disease Coverage ABERDEEN, Scotland, May 30 -- People with a family history of Parkinson's disease may be more susceptible to it after pesticide exposure or repeated blows to the head, European investigators reported. Explain to patients that pesticide exposure has been linked to neurological disorders and other diseases, and that precautions should always be taken when using toxic chemicals. Explain that even a single blow to the head causing loss of consciousness may increase the risk of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Also explain that this type of study can document associations but cannot determine causality and is subject to unrecognized residual confounding. In a case-control study of nearly 1,000 patients with Parksinon's disease or parkinsonism and almost 2,000 controls, high exposure to pesticides increased the risk of the disease by 41%, according to Finlay Dick, M.D., of the University of Aberdeen here, and colleagues. A history of traumatic head blows causing a loss of consciousness, an occupational hazard of boxing and other sports, was associated with a 2.5-fold greater risk, the authors reported in Occupational and Environmental Medicine specialty journal, in an early online release. "It seems likely that Parkinson's disease is not a single disease but a number of phenotypically similar illnesses," the investigators wrote. "A variable range of genetic and environmental interactions may produce these conditions and it may be that any individual risk factor will only affect susceptible subjects." Occupational and environmental risk factors implicated in Parkinson's and other movement disorders include exposure to pesticides, solvents, and metals, the authors noted, but just which toxins are at fault, and what level of exposure is required, is unclear. "The current evidence for occupational risk factors for Parkinson's disease has several weaknesses," they wrote. "Many studies of occupational exposures have had small sample sizes. There have been few studies of occupational exposures to solvents or metals. The exposure estimates employed in some studies have been relatively crude, sometimes as simple as exposed or job title classifications. It is known that such exposure surrogates may lead to misclassification of exposure." The authors' case-control study was conducted with patients in Scotland, Sweden, Italy, Romania, and Malta. They enrolled 959 patients with prevalent parkinsonism, 767 of whom had a diagnosis of Parkinson's according to the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank clinical diagnostic criteria. Patients with drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular parkinsoism, or dementia were excluded. The patients were matched by age and gender with 1,989 controls from a variety of clinical and community settings. Trained interviewers administered to participants a questionnaire about lifetime occupational and hobby exposure to solvents, pesticides, iron, copper, and manganese. Investigators blinded to disease status estimated lifetime and average annual exposures using a job-exposure matrix modified by subjective exposure modeling. The subjective exposure modeling takes into consideration factors such as ventilation, methods of chemical application, and whether the worker used protective measures. The investigators created multiple logistic regression models to analyze results, controlling for age, gender, country, tobacco use, ever knocked unconscious, and family history of Parkinson's disease. They found that compared with patients with no exposure, the odds ratio for low pesticide exposure and Parkinson's-parkinsonism was not significant, at 1.13 (95% confidence interval 0.82 to 1.57) but high pesticide exposure was significantly associated with risk (odds ratio 1.41, 95% CI, 1.06 to 1.88). In addition, they found that being knocked unconscious even once carried a significant risk for Parkinson's compared with never being knocked unconscious (odds ratio 1.35, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.68). Patients who had been knocked out more than once vs. never had an odds ratio for Parkinson's or parkinsonism of 2.53, (95% CI 1.78 to 3.59). Hypnotic, anxiolytic or antidepressant drug use for more than one year were associated with odds ratios ranging from 1.33 to 1.92 for Parkinson's, and a family history of the disease in a first-degree relative was associated with a nearly five-fold risk (odds ratio 4.85, 95% CI, 3.43 to 6.86). As other studies have suggested, tobacco use was protective (odds ratio 0.48, 95% CI, .40 to 0.58), but alcohol was not (odds ratio 0.92, 95% CI, 0.74 to 1.15). When the authors restricted their analyses to the 767 patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, the results were similar, they noted. "This study has provided important evidence of the increased risk of Parkinson's disease in relation to exposure to pesticides. The exposure-response relationship suggests that pesticide exposure may be a causative and potentially modifiable risk factor," the investigators wrote. They noted that their results may be limited by recall bias and by an underestimation of pesticide exposure because of the seasonal nature of pesticides use. They also pointed out that "no information as to the timing of head injury, or use of medication was sought and accordingly we cannot state that these exposures predate symptom onset. Thus, the observed association with head injury may be due to recall bias or to an increased risk of falls in Parkinson's disease. Equally, the use of psychotropic medication may simply reflect the well recognized psychiatric effects of Parkinson's disease." This study was underwritten by the European Union.

AMO Lens Solution Recall: Stock Drops, Outbreak Still a Mystery May 30, 2007. By Gordon Gibb Upon news Friday of the Advanced Medical Optics voluntary recall of , stock in the company fell sharply, dropping in value by nearly 14 per cent. What's more, company officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta still have no idea what caused the outbreak of Acanthamoeba involving 138 users of AMO's Complete MoisturePlus lens solution. The parasite is far more common than that which caused the Fusarium fungal infections linked to a Bausch and Lomb product last year, and rarely infects the eye. But Acanthamoeba packs a powerful punch when it does, and is difficult to treat. The impact is quite serious. Dr. Robert Cykiert, a leading ophthalmologist at the New York University Medical Center and a clinical associate professor at the NYU School of Medicine, was quoted in the New York Times this morning as saying that up to half of those acquiring the Acanthamoeba infection will require corneal transplants, vs. 30 per cent of those suffering a Fusarium fungal infection. While the cause may still be a mystery, the manufacturer and the CDC in Atlanta are advising users of AMO Complete MoisturePlus to dispose of any unused bottles of the product, the lens cases and even the lenses themselves. It is projected that close to two million Americans could be at risk, based on Advanced Medical Optic's market share of the thirty million wearers of contact lenses in the U.S. On Friday of last week, Advanced Medical Optics announced a voluntary recall of its Complete MoisturePlus Lens solution after the CDC in Atlanta linked 138 cases of Acanthamoeba infection to the product. The recall came the same day as the CDC advised the company about is' preliminary study of Acanthamoeba victims since early 2005 showed that users of AMO Complete MoisturePlus were found to be seven times more likely to suffer an infection. Ironically, the day before the recall, Advanced Medical announced its' interest in pursuing the purchase of eye care products maker Bausch and Lomb, the company that was hit with the Fusarium fungal recall last year over its' ReNu with MoistureLoc solution. The takeover bid for control of B&L, a much larger company than Advanced Medical, is on hold for now while AMO focuses on managing the recall, and determining the origins of the outbreak. They've been down this road before To the manufacturer's credit, Advanced Medical reacted swiftly once it was advised of the CDC's findings - unlike rival Basuch and Lomb, which was accused of dragging its heels for weeks over the ReNu Fusarium Keratitis infections of 2006. Still, there have been problems in the past for AMO. In November, Advanced Medical recalled 2.9 million packets of its Complete MoisturePlus and Active Packs after three lots in Japan were found to have bacterial contamination. Of those, 183,000 units were sold in the United States. At the time, the company blamed the contamination on a water-borne organism that somehow managed to creep into the solution at the AMO plant in...wait for it.... China (Menu Foods, tainted tooth paste). That sterility issue has since been resolved, the company says, but there remains a question mark for anyone with concerns about where the products introduced into one of the most vulnerable areas of the body, are made. While it has not been disclosed just where the AMO Complete MoisturePlus solution was made, it has been reported that Advanced Medical's manufacturing facility located in Alcobendas, Spain is the primary supplier for the U.S. and European markets. Contact lens users who experience symptoms of an eye infection such as redness, pain, tearing, increased light sensitivity, blurred vision, discharge or swelling, should remove their lenses and consult their eye care provider immediately. Doctors have begun fielding what is expected to be a flood of calls from concerned users. The sleuthing into the cause of the outbreak - and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention DOES use the 'O-word' - continues. Meantime, Advanced Medical Optics reported year-end sales of U.S. $997.5 million for 2006, and adjusted projections for 2007 - following the 2006 recall - were for revenue in the range of $1.06 to $1.08 billion dollars. The company will no doubt have to revise those projections downward. The last major outbreak of Acanthamoeba was in the early 1980's.

The drug, known chemically as temsirolimus, is the third such therapy approved since late 2005 for the disease -- the most common form of kidney cancer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said. In December 2005, the FDA cleared Bayer and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.'s Nexavar, or sorafenib. In January 2006, Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib, also won approval. "The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival," the FDA said. Wyeth, in a statement, said its drug would be available for patients in July. Shares of the drugmaker earlier closed down 27 cents, or less than 1 percent, at $57.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. Company data on Torisel showed that patients who took it alone lived 3.5 months longer overall than those who took it with the cancer drug interferon or a combination of the two, the FDA said.

"The system is really doing what taxpayers are paying us to do," Capital Health spokesman Steve Buick said today. "We are producing dramatically more services for people, but demand is running ahead so fast, especially in Alberta that we are still running to catch up." He was commenting on the annual report compiled by the Ottawa-based Canadian Institute for Health Information in conjunction with Statistics Canada. It does not include statistics from Quebec. Email to a friend While the report looks at about 40 different indicators of how health regions across the country compare in delivering services, this year's report focused on issues surrounding hip fracture surgery. "Generally it confirms Alberta's leadership and especially Capital Health and Calgary's on a whole range of important indicators," he said. In Alberta, 67 per cent of hip fracture surgeries were performed on the same day or the day after admission to hospital. The national average is 65 per cent. "Delays tend to be caused by other health problems these people have," Buick said. "So it's not surprising that a proportion of them are delayed because they are sick with other things." But at 1.1 per thousand, Alberta had a higher rates of people fracturing their hips while staying in the hospital than the national average of 0.8 per thousand. Buick said the report indicates health regions in the province could do a more efficient job in treating patients without admitting them to hospital. "We do generally very well, but when you look at the chart, Ontario and British Columbia's rates are lower than we are," he said. "We could be doing more to use hospital beds better."

Surgery May Be the Answer Surgery Often Provides Rapid Relief for Patients in Pain, Study Says Two new studies show how surgery may offer some patients faster relief from back pain than nonsurgical approaches. By SUPINDA BUNYAVANICH, M.D. ABC News Medical Unit For the millions of Americans with slipped discs and lower back pain, 30-year-old Andrew Neitzke's story strikes a familiar nerve. "My left leg hurt enough that I couldn't walk for more than a few minutes â sometimes even 30 seconds was difficult â and I also couldn't sit for long," he said. "The pain was even waking me during the night, and there were nights when I couldn't sleep at all." Back Pain -- Reason for Compensation or Cash Cow? Herbal Cure for Your Aching Back? Back Pain? Don't Sit Up Straight Beating Lower Back Pain -- Without Surgery Months of medications, physical therapy and steroid injections offered little relief. He was in a bind â should he wait it out, or go under the knife? Surgery May Speed Recovery Two studies in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine may help patients like Neitzke with their decision. The studies compare surgical versus nonsurgical treatment for two common lower spine conditions that cause pain. James Weinstein, of Dartmouth Medical School, and his colleagues studied more than 600 patients from 11 states with degenerative spondylolisthesis â a type of lower back pain caused by slippage of the bones of the spine. This slippage can cause parts of the backbone to press on nerves, potentially causing a great deal of pain. What researchers found was that the patients who ended up in an operating room â about 60 percent of those in the study â experienced less pain and better physical function after two years compared with those who did not have surgery. Those who opted for nonsurgical treatments â including pain medication, physical therapy, steroid injections and chiropractic treatment â also improved, but not to the same extent. "There are two major treatment options: operative and nonoperative," Weinstein said. "This trial shows there is clearly a greater benefit of surgical versus nonsurgical treatment, but nonsurgical treatment is also an option. "There were still many patients who never got surgery ... and it was good enough for them." In a separate trial, Dr. Wilco Peul and his colleagues studied nearly 300 Dutch patients with sciatica â a radiating pain in the leg from compression of nerves in the lower back, often caused by a slipped disc.

Later he flew back to North America because he feared he might die without treatment in the United States. Health officials in North America and Europe sought the passenger lists Wednesday for the two trans-Atlantic airline flights in their effort to find about 80 people who sat near the man, infected with a highly drug-resistant form of tuberculosis. Authorities also disclosed that the man was on several flights within Europe over the course of two weeks earlier this month. Passenger lists for those flights also were being tracked down, they said. &#8220;The investigation is just beginning. It&#8217;s very challenging,&#8221; said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&#8217;s division of global migration and quarantine. The man is under the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963. He continues to feel well and shows no symptoms, Cetron said. &#8220;Is the patient himself highly infectious? Fortunately, in this case, he&#8217;s probably not,&#8221; CDC Director Dr. Julie Gerberding said. &#8220;But the other piece is this bacteria is a very deadly bacteria. We just have to err on the side of caution.&#8221; CDC officials are concentrating on the trans-Atlantic flights, when the likelihood of spreading the disease was greatest because the man was in a confined space with other people for many hours. The CDC was trying to contact 27 crew members from the two flights for testing, along with about 80 passengers who sat in the five rows surrounding the man. Other passengers on the flights are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the level of TB bacteria the man carried was low, Cetron said. CDC officials said they are working closely with airlines. Health officials in France said they have asked Air France-KLM for passenger lists, and the Italian Health Ministry said it is tracing the man&#8217;s movements. A spokeswoman for Czech airline CSA said medical checks showed no infections among its crew members who flew with the man. The airline also was contacting passengers. Health officials said that before he took the trip, the man had been advised not to fly and knew he could expose others to illness when he boarded the jets. He had a supply of masks to wear for the protection of other passengers, but it is not clear whether he used them, Cetron said. The man told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that doctors did not order him not to fly and only suggested he put off his long-planned wedding. He said he knew he had a form of tuberculosis and that it was resistant to commonly used drugs, but he did not realize until he was in Europe that it could be so dangerous. &#8220;We headed off to Greece thinking everything&#8217;s fine,&#8221; he told the newspaper. The newspaper did not identify him at his request, because of the stigma attached to his diagnosis. He flew to Paris on May 12 aboard Air France Flight 385, also listed as Delta Air Lines codeshare Flight 8517. He and his bride then took four more flights within Europe. While he was in Rome, health authorities reached him with the news that further tests had revealed his TB was a rare, &#8220;extensively drug-resistant&#8221; form, far more dangerous than he had known. They told him to turn himself over to Italian health officials and not to fly on commercial airlines. &#8220;I thought to myself: You&#8217;re nuts. I wasn&#8217;t going to do that. They told me I had been put on the no-fly list and my passport was flagged,&#8221; the man told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Instead, on May 24, the man flew from Rome to Prague. From Prague, the couple left for Montreal the same day, according to CDC officials. The man then drove into the United States at Champlain, N.Y. He told the newspaper he was afraid that if he did not get back to the United States, he wouldn&#8217;t get the treatment he needed. He is not facing prosecution, health officials said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a very well-educated, successful, intelligent person,&#8221; he told the paper. &#8220;This is insane to me that I have an armed guard outside my door when I&#8217;ve cooperated with everything other than the whole solitary-confinement-in-Italy thing.&#8221; The man is at Atlanta&#8217;s Grady Memorial Hospital under federal quarantine order. A sheriff&#8217;s deputy was assigned to guard him. The man has a right to appeal the order, but has not, Cetron said. A spokesman for Denver&#8217;s National Jewish Hospital, which specializes in respiratory disorders, said Wednesday the man would be treated there. It was not clear when he would arrive. The man&#8217;s wife tested negative for TB before the couple&#8217;s trip and is not considered a public health risk, health officials said. TRACKING THE TB PATIENT The Georgia man has a routine chest X-ray and a spot is found on his lung. The man is found to have tuberculosis and treatment begins. The man is notified in Atlanta that tests show he has multi-drug-resistant TB and should not travel. The man flies on Air France 285 from Atlanta to Paris. He flies on Air France 1232 from Paris to Athens to get married. He flies from Athens to Thira Island. He flies from Mykonos Island to Athens, then Athens to Rome. The CDC contacts him in Rome and tells him he has highly drug-resistant TB and should not take a commercial flight. He takes Czech Air 727 from Rome to Prague; Czech Air 104 from Prague to Montreal; drives into the United States at Champlain, N.Y. He enters New York hospital. Patient is taken to Atlanta&#8217;s Grady Memorial Hospital and placed in respiratory isolation. _&#8212; The Associated Press About the Real Cities Network About the McClatchy Company

Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston studied 60 healthy women -- 12 with high blood pressure (140/90 milligrams of mercury or higher) and 48 with normal blood pressure. All the women ate two kinds of diets for eight weeks each. One was the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, which consisted of 30 percent of calories from fat (with 7 percent or less from saturated fat), 15 percent from protein, and 55 percent from carbohydrates, 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day, two meals of fatty fish (such as salmon or tuna) per week, and less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol a day. The other diet had the same calorie, fat and protein content, but the women replaced 25 grams of protein intake with one-half cup of unsalted soy nuts. "Soy nut supplementation significantly reduced systolic (top number) and diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure in all 12 hypertensive women and in 40 of the 48 normotensive women," the study authors wrote. "Compared with the TLC diet alone, the TLC diet plus soy nuts lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure 9.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, in hypertensive women, and 5.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in normotensive women." In women with high blood pressure, the soy nuts also decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein ("bad") cholesterol by an average of 11 percent and levels of apoliprotein B (a particle that carries bad cholesterol) by an average of 8 percent.

The new study, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , included 60 healthy postmenopausal women who were 53-58 years old, on At the study's start, 12 of the women had high blood pressure. They tended to be a little heavier than the 48 other women with normal blood pressure based on average BMI (body mass index), which relates height to weight. High blood pressure makes heart disease and a host of other health problems During the study, the women spent eight weeks on a healthy diet that didn't include soy nuts. After that, they took a blood pressure test. The women also spent another eight weeks on the same healthy diet. But this time, they replaced some of their protein with half a cup of unsalted soy nuts, split into three or four portions spread throughout the day. Finally, the women took one more blood pressure test. The women's blood pressure was lowest after eight weeks of snacking on soy nuts, even for those who started the study with normal blood pressure. For the 12 women who had high blood pressure at the study's start, average systolic blood pressure (the first number in a blood pressure reading) dropped by nearly 10% and average diastolic blood pressure (the second number in a blood pressure reading) dropped by almost 7% after eight weeks of snacking on soy nuts. For the other 48 women who had normal blood pressure at the study's start, average systolic blood pressure dropped by about 5% and average diastolic blood pressure dropped by 3% after eight weeks of snacking on soy nuts. Women with high blood pressure also had an 11% drop in levels of their LDL ("bad") cholesterol after snacking on the soy nuts for eight weeks. No cholesterol benefits were seen in the women with normal blood pressure. The study doesn't show why soy nuts were linked to lower blood pressure. But the researchers write that diets that include soy foods "may be a practical, safe, and inexpensive" way to reduce blood pressure. Larger studies should be done to confirm the findings, wrote the researchers, who included Francine Welty, MD, PhD. Welty is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, preventive cardiologist at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute's Specialized Center of Research in Vascular Injury, Repair, and Remodeling. Men weren't included in this study, but other research suggests that soy foods may help men's blood pressure, Welty noted. "The study was started to assess soy as an alternative to hormone replacement therapy. That's why men were not studied in this particular trial," Welty told WebMD. She noted that two other published studies have shown blood pressure reduction in men and women who ate soy foods as part of their diet. One of those studies included soy cookies; the other included soy milk. Reviewed by Louise Chang ©2007 WebMD, Inc. All rights reserved. Now you're in the public comment zone.

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070531.wxpicard31/BNStory/specialScienceandHealth/home&cid globeandmail.com: Anti-smoking rules too mild Letters to the Editor Anti-smoking rules too mild From Thursday's Globe and Mail May 31, 2007 at 8:56 AM EDT It's been exactly one year since Quebec's sweeping smoking ban took effect on World No Tobacco Day. Smoking was banned in bars, restaurants, taverns, casinos, on school grounds and within nine metres of any exterior door of a health, social services or educational institution. Quebec was one of the last bastions of the smoky bar, and there were dire warnings that the province's legendary joie de vivre and nightlife would be crushed under the advances of Big Brother. Despite the sky-is-falling claims of some bar owners (most of them aligned with Big Tobacco), the world as we know it did not come to a grinding, smokeless halt. Bar business did not go &#34;poof.&#34; Bingo halls did not go bankrupt. Nicotine addicts did not drop dead outside hospitals as they trudged nine metres from the door desperately searching for a place for a legal puff. In fact, according to a new poll, the smoking ban is enormously popular with the public: 78 per cent of Quebeckers surveyed - including 60 per cent of current smokers - said the legislation has improved the health and quality of life of citizens. Interestingly, it is young adults aged 18 to 24 - the demographic that tends to hang out in bars and restaurants and the age group in which smoking is most popular - who are the most enthusiastic about the smoke-free rules. &#34;The more people go to bars the more they appreciate the new law,&#34; said Louis Gauvin, spokesman for the Quebec Coalition for Tobacco Control. According to the Quebec poll, about one in 10 smokers have kicked the habit in the year since the ban was introduced. The quit rate was twice as high, 21 per cent, in the youngest age group. Now, you can dismiss the poll as the work of anti-tobacco zealots, but nothing in the survey is the least bit surprising. The majority of provinces and territories - British Columbia and Alberta being the notable exceptions - have comprehensive smoke-free legislation, and municipal bylaws are commonplace. All the credible research has repeatedly shown the same results: smoke-free laws have no discernible impact on sales of food or liquor; smoking bans help people quit; outlawing smoking is popular with the general public; and the stronger and the more extensive the ban, the more bang you get for your buck in terms of public-health benefits. Yet for all the perceived bellyaching by business, and strong public support for smoke-free legislation, laws remain pretty tame in Canada. Quebec, for example, still allows smoking on most patios (why restaurant and bar owners reserve prime seating for smokers, a small minority, defies logic) and the sidewalks outside some bars and office towers are like giant ashtrays, a violation of the spirit if not the letter of the law. Similarly, it remains far too easy to buy cigarettes, even for minors. And our health system provides paltry support to those trying to quit. Fewer than 20 per cent of Canadians now smoke. Yet we still tolerate smoking in virtually all public spaces such as parks and allow parents to smoke in cars in the presence of their children, areas where numerous European jurisdictions have cracked down. It is clear that there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. There are about 4,000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke, more than 50 of them carcinogenic. Exposure to second-hand smoke causes cardiovascular and respiratory disease, and worsens existing conditions such as asthma. Sound public-health policy requires that all workplaces and public places be 100-per-cent smoke-free. No exceptions. This is not a persecution of smokers: it is necessary for the protection of non-smokers. Many policy makers and public-health officials think of anti-smoking campaigns as pass&#233; and boring. But tobacco remains a leading killer, claiming the lives of 45,000 Canadians a year. It also costs the economy about $24-billion annually in medical costs and productivity losses. Globally, smoking already claims more than five million lives a year, and tobacco companies have shifted their marketing efforts and opposition to anti-smoking legislation to the developing world. Unless dramatic and sustained action is taken, smoking will kill more than one billion people worldwide in the 21st Century - 10 times the number who died in the 20th Century. Smoking is not somebody else's problem. It is a continuing public-health disaster and a drain on prosperity. We should think of that each time we enjoy a meal or a drink in a smoke-free restaurant or bar. And each puff of smoke that assaults us when walking down the sidewalk, or that blows across a patio to sour an outing, should serve as a reminder that much more remains to be done. Well, Darin, the CDC reports that "Cigarette smoking... this whole "anti tobacco" thing is going to far. ... Damn right!I think the major thing that needs to be...

The level of wellness or health is, in part, determined by the ability to deal with and defend against stress. Health is determined by physiological, psychological, socio-cultural, spiritual, and developmental stage variables. 5 ways you can beat lower back pain Buy best Back Pain products from Amazon Back Pain :: 5 ways you can beat lower back pain The National Institutes of Health estimates that eight out of ten people will suffer from back pain, making it one of the most common medical problems today. The good news is that you can treat it, minimize it, and even prevent it by following some back-friendly guidelines. Most adults will experience lower back pain sometime during their lifetime. The good news is you can usually prevent or reduce the pain yourself. Lower back pain is something that almost everyone will experience at some time in their lives. In fact, the National Institutes of Health estimates that eight out of ten people will suffer from back pain, making it one of the most common medical problems today. It affects women and men equally, and can happen at any age, according to The Cleveland Clinics Arthritis Advisor. Thats the bad news. The good news is that you can treat it, minimize it, and even prevent it by following some back-friendly guidelines. The better physical condition youre in, the less likely youll injure your back, says Santhosh Thomas, D.O., medical director of Cleveland Clinics Westlake Spine Center. Thats why everybody can benefit from strong abdominal and back muscles. Many factors can cause lower back pain. Thankfully, most cases are not serious and respond to simple, non-invasive treatments. Trauma and injuries from sprains and strains are common culprits, but pain can also stem from degenerative conditions such as arthritis and osteoporosis. Bone disease, viral infections, irritation to joints, disc herniation, and congenital abnormalities in the spine can also cause an achy back. Poor body mechanics can cause problems, too. If youve overdone it playing golf or pulling up weeds, the result is likely to be a sore back. You can just sleep awkwardly and get a stiff back, says Dr. Thomas. Age also plays a part. As you get older, bone strength and muscle elasticity decrease while your spinal discs begin to lose fluid and flexibility, which decreases their ability to cushion the spines vertebrae. Certain health-related conditions and habitssuch as obesity, stress, poor posture, and smokingcan also aggravate your back. Because its such a common problem, it might be tempting to treat back pain as a minor matter. But Dr. Thomas says its important to seek medical care if you experience severe painparticularly pain that wakes you at nightpain that radiates from your back into your legs, or pain that doesnt go away in a reasonable amount of time. These symptoms could indicate more serious conditions than just a strained muscle. Fortunately, most cases of lower back pain can be treated at home. Ice or a cold pack can ease soreness, Dr. Thomas says, although some people find more relief from applying heat or taking a hot shower or bath. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or acetaminophen (Tylenol), are also helpful. If you find such remedies dont help, muscle relaxants or prescription-strength pain medicine may be pre-scribed. Your doctor may also refer you to a specialist for physical therapy targeted at easing the pain as well as strengthening your back muscles. Surgery, Dr. Thomas says, is the last resort for most conditions. Once your pain has subsided enough to allow you to comfortably move about, exercise is recommended. Anything that keeps your joints moving and maintains flexibility is good for you, says Dr. Thomas. Walking, biking, and swimming are particularly beneficial if you suffer from back pain. Meanwhile, consider the exercises shown here to keep back pain at bay. As with any exercise program, check with your doctor before you begin.

The study, published in the American Journal of Neuroscience, was conducted on mice. The scientists now plan to study the effects of the chemical epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals and then humans, combined with mild exercise. The food chemical epicatechin is one of a group of chemicals known as flavanols found in certain food items including chocolate, tea, grapes and blueberries. Earlier studies have already shown that the antioxidant compound flavanol could help improve cardiovascular health. Now the researchers, led by Henriette van Praag, working with chocolate firm Mars, compared mice that were fed a normal diet with those that were fed a diet supplemented with epicatechin. Half the mice in each group were allowed to run on a wheel for two hours each day and were trained to find a platform hidden in a pool of water, a month later. Those mice that exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice. The epicatechin-fed mice who did not exercise also showed enhanced memory, but to a lesser degree. The mice on the special diet appeared to have greater blood vessel growth in certain parts of their brain, along with more mature brain nerve cells, the online edition of BBC News reported. "This is important because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory-enhancing effects, suggesting it may be possible to optimise brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation," Mark Mattson, a doctor at the US National Institute on Ageing, said. However, nutritionists warned chocolate is high in fat and sugar, which may undo any potential benefits. They recommended a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, with perhaps a small amount of chocolate.

Three of the men  all of whom have HIV and were arrested on Sunday  were suspected of drugging other men and abusing them during sex parties. The suspicion is that at these parties, they had unsafe sex with people they had drugged, and also that these people were injected with infected blood, district police chief Ronald Zwarter said. The motive to do this was the kick, and the feeling that unsafe sex is pure, Zwarter said. Two of the suspects confessed to injecting the victims. The fourth suspect is suspected of selling a considerable amount of drugs, including Ecstasy and GHB, an intoxicant that is sometimes known as a date rape drug, police said. All four were brought before a judge yesterday and were ordered held for 90 days. Police said they didnt rule out further arrests and called on other victims to come forward, or contact a help line to receive HIV testing. © Thomas Crosbie Media 2007.

Preliminary investigations by the country's health officials have suggested a potential link between the infections - caused by a parasitic amoeba - and use of a moisture-locking contact solution. But some experts believe that the outbreak simply signifies a larger problem with multipurpose contact solutions that simultaneously aim to disinfect and lubricate lenses. On 25 May, Advanced Medical Optics announced a of its Complete MoisturePlus contact solution. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory the same day tentatively linking this lens solution to the outbreak of keratitis - damage to the cornea cased by a toxin released by the parasite. About one quarter of the people with the infection require corneal transplants. The CDC said it had received reports of 138 recent cases of the infection across 35 states. Of this group, the agency had full clinical data for 46 patients, 39 of whom wore soft contact lenses. And of those who wore such lenses, 58% used Complete MoisturePlus contact solution. Still, Advanced Medical Optics stresses that there is currently no direct evidence showing the solution was contaminated with the In 2006, health officials connected the MoistureLoc contact solution made by Bausch & Lomb to a similar corneal infection called keratitis, caused by a fungus. Exactly how the solution contributed to this infection remains unclear, however. The reasons for the more recent keratitis outbreak has similarly puzzled experts. "I don't think there is a single consensus about the reason for the increased reporting of infections," says ophthalmologist Steven Verity at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. He points out that the microbe is ubiquitous: "It's basically found everywhere. You can't run away from it." The waterborne parasite is present in tap water, hot tubs and lakes, for example. "We're exposed to this stuff all day, every day," explains Kathryn Colby of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston. Colby has treated four patients with keratitis in the past year, and says the number of such cases seems to be on the rise. There are few treatments for the infection, and doctors sometime must resort to applying baquacil - a swimming pool cleaner - to patients' eyes. Normally, a protective layer about six cells thick on the outside of the cornea prevents the parasite from establishing itself in the eye. Colby believes that the combination of newer, silicone hydrogel contact lenses, and lens solution that locks in moisture, might create a "perfect storm" that dismantles this protective layer outside the cornea. This, in turn, would make the eye susceptible to infection. There has been some suggestion that changes in chlorination of water supplies has increased the prevalence of , notes Dan Jones, chairman of ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, US. But Jones agrees that some chemical component in the moisture-locking solutions probably plays a large role in promoting eye infection. According Jones, the US Food and Drug Administration "must step in" and "look critically at multipurpose contact lens solution". He suggests that it might be best to revert to using separate solutions to disinfect and lubricate contact lenses. Cornea specialists say that health officials should quickly address the recent outbreak of keratitis. "It's really a wake-up call that some current contact solutions are not doing the job," says Colby. Experts say that people should avoid "risky behaviours" such as swimming in lakes and rivers while wearing contact lenses. And even washing the face in tap water can be a cause of infection. People are also advised to change their eye solution every day, not merely top up the solution sitting in the lens cases. Colby also urges people to consider wearing disposable daily lenses instead of those that are replaced every month.

Siti Fadilah Supari, Indonesia's health minister, said the clinical trial would involve "hundreds of participants" and conclude in October, according to an Associated Press (AP) report published today. She also said Indonesia would initially stockpile 2 million doses of the vaccine. In February, Indonesia revealed it had stopped sharing H5N1 virus samples with the World Health Organization (WHO) in a protest against drug companies' use of the samples to make vaccines seen as too costly for developing countries. Soon afterward Indonesia signed a memorandum of understanding with US-based Baxter International, owner of Baxter Healthcare, which laid the groundwork for future collaboration or supply agreements on H5N1 vaccines. Chris Bona, a Baxter spokesman in Deerfield, Ill., told CIDRAP News today that the company has not announced any plans for a clinical trial of its vaccine in Indonesia and has not signed any new agreements with Indonesia beyond the initial memorandum of understanding in February. Bona said there were no firm plans to produce the company's vaccine in Indonesia and no agreements about stockpiling. In addition, any Indonesian H5N1 samples Baxter would use to develop a vaccine would likely come directly from the WHO, Bona said. On May 15 Indonesia announced it had resumed sharing its H5N1 samples with the WHO. A week later, during the annual meeting of WHO member countries, the WHO negotiated a preliminary agreement designed to maintain the international sharing of flu virus samples while ensuring that developing countries can obtain pandemic flu vaccines Baxter has a cell culture&#150;based H5N1 vaccine under development. Last October the company said the preliminary results of a phase I/II clinical trial showed a good immune response against drifted H5N1 strains. The vaccine was based on a 2004 strain of H5N1 from Vietnam.

Eduoard H.R. Gluck / Bloomberg News / Landov For contact lens wearers, the story has become a familiar one: a contact lens solution is yanked from the market amid reports of potentially debilitating disease. This time around, the product is Complete MoisturePlus, manufactured by Advanced Medical Optics (AMO), on news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that the multi-purpose solution is linked to a rare but serious eye infection that can severely corrode the cornea and even lead to blindness. The recall is the latest in a string that has kept contact wearers wondering what solution is safe to use. Just a year ago, Bausch & Lomb was the company in the hot seat after the CDC released data on a different kind of eye infection that showed a disproportionate number of people suffering from the disease had been using the company's ReNu with MoistureLoc. The company issued a massive recall and discontinued the solution worldwide. Since then, there has been a handful of less-widespread recalls, set off by issues ranging from bacterial contamination in a Chinese plant to the detection of trace amounts of iron that could cause lens cleaner to lose its effectiveness. The narrative of the Complete MoisturePlus recall, announced on May 25, closely echoes what happened last year with ReNu MoistureLoc, although the microbes involved were different. In each case, local clinicians first noticed an uptick in a rare eye condition and reported the spike to the CDC, which launched an investigation and subsequently found that many people with the disease reported using the same contact solution. The disease involved in last year's ReNu MoistureLoc recall was the fungal infection keratitis. The disease associated with the Complete MoisturePlus recall is caused by , a water-borne parasite that occurs naturally but in the human eye can lead to serious infections of the cornea. The CDC interviewed 46 people who had the condition, called keratitis, and found that 21 of them reported using Complete MoisturePlus &#151; amounting to a risk seven times greater for people using the product than those who weren't. At this point, it isn't clear why that correlation exists. Or what lessons might be drawn from the similarity of this year's recall with last year's. "We're not prepared to make any generalizations at the moment," says CDC medical epidemiologist Dr. Sharon Roy, "but it does bring up questions about multi-purpose solutions." One of those questions, says cornea specialist Dr. William Ehlers, is whether multi-purpose solutions, standard products for soft contact lens wearers, are as effective as earlier peroxide-based cleaners. In fact, some studies show that peroxide-based cleaners, which involve a two-step cleaning process and bubbling action to remove dirt and build-up, are better at killing certain types of organisms. But they are also more cumbersome to use than multi-purpose solution, which simply involves a rinse. "Manufacturers have wanted to produce solutions that are convenient and comfortable, but it may be a trade-off to a certain extent between convenience and efficacy," says Dr. Ehlers, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Does that mean that consumers should go back to older types of cleaners? Dr. Ehlers says: "People ought to be having this conversation with their eye-care professional." Another factor in last year's case that may resurface in this newest warning is how people misuse contact lenses and solution. Reusing or topping off old solution is a classic way to encourage infection. No-nos such as rinsing the inside of a contact case with water instead of solution, or showering or swimming while wearing lenses, may prove to be linked to the Complete MoisturePlus recall, since the parasite involved is water-borne. But the CDC's Roy is careful to point out that the investigation is still in its early stages, and little is known so far beyond the initial link. In the meantime, for the decision-averse, at least there's one less solution on the shelf to choose from.

Dr. Ronald Krall, medical director of the pharmaceutical giant, posted a letter in the online version of The Lancet medical journal saying data from long-term, large-scale clinical trials has shown Avandia to be safe. Research reported in the New England Journal of Medicine last week revealed a 43 percent increase in heart attacks among diabetics who took Avandia. The death rate for those who experienced heart attacks, according to the analysis led by Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, was a staggering 63 percent. Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of the Health Research Group at the Washington, D.C.-based consumer watchdog organization Public Citizen, said diabetics using Avandia should focus on scientific data. GlaxoSmithKline has financial reasons in mind, Wolfe said, when reporting that Avandia poses no risks to diabetics. "When they say it's safe and doesn't produce a heart-attack risk, I can understand that as a marketing strategy, but it does not accord with the facts," Wolfe said. "They're trying to counter the bad publicity their drug has gotten over the past couple of weeks." The study's troubling news isn't the first to thrust Avandia into the spotlight. In January of last year there was a shortage of the drug because of production problems at GlaxoSmithKline's manufacturing plant in Cidra, Puerto Rico. The company said the delay had nothing to do with the drug itself and that other GlaxoSmithKline medications manufactured at the plant were also in short supply. In his letter yesterday, Krall included data from two large clinical trials in which Avandia was tested. Both studies, he said, demonstrated that the drug is safe and effective. But Wolfe said a "black box" warning should be attached to Avandia's label. A black box warning is the FDA's highest level of caution. The Food and Drug Administration is advising diabetics to talk to their physicians about the medication. In an alert posted last week on its Web site, the FDA noted that other studies have found the drug poses no harm. Last week, Public Citizen released what it said was an internal 2002 FDA memo, showing that the agency was aware of heart failure cases associated with Avandia and another diabetes drug called Actos, manufactured by Takeda Pharmaceuticals of Illinois. Both drugs are in the class known as thiazolidinediones. Wolfe said he had been warning consumers since 1994 not to take Avandia. "The real irony here is this: The main reason anyone takes a diabetes drug is to prevent cardiovascular risk because heart disease is the main condition that diabetics die of," Wolfe said. "Now there's evidence that it causes cardiovascular disease." Subscribe to Newsday home delivery Article licensing and reprint options Post a comment |

And women with moderately elevated blood pressure -- a condition known as pre-hypertension -- also showed reductions in their blood pressure after eight weeks of eating soy nuts, Dr. Francine K. Welty of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and her colleagues found. "We know that people in the pre-hypertension group are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease," Welty told Reuters Health in an interview. "This would provide a dietary treatment that could safely lower blood pressures in that pre-hypertensive range." She pointed out that while studies are still underway to determine if people with pre-hypertension should take drugs to lower their blood pressure. Welty and her team recruited 60 postmenopausal women, 12 of whom had hypertension, to begin the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, which involves cutting fat, cholesterol, sodium and calories. Each study participant spent eight weeks on the TLC diet alone and eight weeks on the TLC diet plus a half-cup of dry-roasted, unsalted soy nuts daily. While eating the soy nuts, the women subtracted the equivalent amount of protein from other sources so their protein consumption remained constant. The researchers chose soy nuts, Welty noted, because they are among the least processed sources of soy available, and are more convenient and portable than either soy milk or tofu. Hypertensive women in the soy nut-group had a drop in systolic blood pressure (the top number of the blood pressure reading) of 9.9 percent, and a drop in diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) of 6.8 percent. Among those with pre-hypertension (systolic blood pressures between 120 mmHg and 139 mmHg), the soy nuts decreased systolic blood pressure by 5.5 percent and diastolic blood pressure by 2.7 percent. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Poor diets based on fatty and sweet ingredients combined with the lack of physical exercise account for six of the seven top factors leading to bad health, according to EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou. Now the biggest problem of obesity is in the southern member states who have abandoned the Mediterranean diet and go for the same kind of nutrition of fast food as elsewhere, he said. In second place on the obesity lists come men from Malta and women from Cyprus. The Commission said that it was considering tightening food advertising and nutrition labeling rules if companies failed to improve consumer awareness about unhealthy foods. Kyprianou said that he wanted to encourage food companies to provide consumers with full information about the health risks associated with their products. A few hundred pensioners...

Win a luxurious VIP ticket package for four to Swan Lake at the Royal Albert Hall with English National Ballet. Dutch couple may have injected dozens with HIV more articles by Gus Cairns Four HIV positive men from Groeningen province in the north of the Netherlands, in a sensational case, have confessed to the police that they held sex parties where they drugged men with GHB and injected them with their own blood in an attempt to infect them. Dutch HIV workers told Gay.com that they were aware that at least 10 men who attended the sex parties had contracted HIV  which implies that considerably more men were victims of the assaults. The accused are two 48-year old men from Slochteren and two men from Groeningen aged 33 and 34. Two have confessed to the sexual assault and deliberate infection attempts: the other two have so far only admitted to dealing in huge quantities of GHB. One does not define as gay. Five victims between the ages of 25 and 50 have reported to the police so far and four of them have filed charges. The Dutch public prosecutor has charged the men with premeditated grievous bodily harm, but said it could not charge them with attempted murder or manslaughter because the life expectancy of the victims can be extended with medication. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 16 years in prison. Gay.com spoke to Robert Witlox, Director of the Dutch HIV Association, who takes up the story. We became aware that something odd was going on in Groeningen about a year ago. Someone came to a support group for people newly diagnosed with HIV and gave us this story about having been drugged unconscious with GHB and raped, which was how he got the virus. At first we dismissed it  you hear many such stories in support groups  but several other people came forward with similar stories. One said he had come to to find a man still fucking him without a condom while another said that during the experience he had felt a sharp needle-like pain in his anus. The suspects have confessed that they took syringes of blood missed from all four of them and injected them into their victims anuses. Witlox continues: The men would advertise small sex parties  3-5 people - on the internet. It appears they were doing it on a frequent basis, and it continued right up till they were arrested in May. We alerted the public health department in Groeningen who said they had heard similar stories. They put out a press release warning gay men warning gay men about attending sex parties and saying they had noticed a rise in local HIV infections. We finally persuaded the first victim  who does not publicly identify as gay  to make a formal complaint to the police in January. Witlox commented that one of the features of the case was that the victims appeared largely to be non-gay-identified men seeking bisexual thrills on the internet. The two who have made confessions to the police said that they were motivated by lust and because if they made other men positive theyd have the opportunity to have unprotected sex with them. Witlox comments: In many ways this is a straightforward case. The legal argument about HIV transmission has always been about reckless infection, (i.e. not meaning to infect, but not caring either), whereas this is a clear case of rape and of attempted deliberate infection. Judging by the confessions, the accused must have had psychiatric problems around having HIV. In talking to the media yesterday, not just myself but also representatives from the Dutch Health Ministry said that this behaviour was not typical of gay men or people with HIV. Witlox added, however, that since then his organisation has been accused of fostering a culture of normalising unsafe sex. Journalists are now linking the case with the fact that we have a support group called Positive and Proud where subjects like serosorting (i.e. consensual unprotected sex between HIV positive people) are discussed. Weve been asked if we have any norms. Weve said: Yes, we do; were saying its not alright to rape people and deliberately infect them with HIV! Image courtesy of the excellent &copy;1995-2007 PLANETOUT INC.

Researchers at Aberdeen University in Scotland worked with those in Italy, Sweden, Romania and Malta to look at the life histories of 959 patients suffering from Parkinson's and 1,989 patients who were not to try and tease out the possible causes for the disease. Short-term antioxidant doesn't help Parkinson's FDA OKs Drug Patch to Treat Parkinson's They found that having close family members with Parkinson's increased an individual's risk for the disease by five times, being knocked unconscious more than once increased the risk two and a half times and having high pesticide exposure in work or hobbies made someone 33 percent more likely to contract Parkinson's. The study was published this week in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine. "It's a solid study, [but] it has the limitations of many studies of this type," said Harvey Checkoway, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington who was not involved with the research. Parkinson's is the second most common degenerative brain disease, following Alzheimer's, afflicting around 1 million Americans, including 1 percent of all Americans above the age of 60. The World's Most Famous Parkinson's Patient Parkinson's supposed link to head injury is most commonly associated with three-time heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali, who was diagnosed in 1983, nearly two years after his retirement from the sport. But many experts dispute the connection. "I'm a little lost to understand why they believe that is related to his head injuries," said Thomas Hammeke, co-chief of the neuropsychology division at the Medical College of Wisconsin. He said that the rate of Parkinson's disease for boxers has not been shown to be any higher than for other professions. He added that football players, despite often suffering multiple concussions, have not been shown to suffer widely from the disease. Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

The disease was first discovered and its symptoms documented in 1817-Essay on the Shaking Palsy, by the British physician Dr. James Parkinson; the associated biochemical changes in the brain of patients were identified in the 1960s. Biogen Idec & Vernalis Plc starts trial of BIIB014 in Parkinson's Disease Buy best Parkinson's Disease products from Amazon Parkinson's Disease :: Biogen Idec & Vernalis Plc starts trial of BIIB014 in Parkinson's Disease Biogen Idec (NASDAQ: BIIB) and Vernalis plc (LSE: VER, Nasdaq: VNLS) announced the initiation of the Phase II program of BIIB014 (also known as V2006), an oral compound, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. BIIB014 is an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist that may offer a non-dopaminergic therapy for patients with Parkinson's disease. The initial Phase II study is a double-blind, placebo controlled randomised trial of single and repeated doses of BIIB014 in patients with late-stage Parkinson's disease. In the trial BIIB014 will be added on to the patients usual L-dopa therapy. The second Phase II study will be a double-blind, placebo controlled randomised, dose-ranging trial of BIIB014 monotherapy in patients with early-stage Parkinson's disease. The primary endpoint of both studies will be to evaluate the safety and tolerability of BIIB014. Secondary endpoints will include the evaluation of motor function. Simon Sturge, CEO of Vernalis commented: "The progress into Phase II trials is of particular significance to Vernalis' growing Parkinson's disease franchise and further demonstrates the company's ongoing commitment to the Parkinson's community. Dopamine replacement therapy has been the cornerstone of Parkinson's disease therapy, but there is a real need for a new class of non-dopaminergic agents which may help to restore motor function in Parkinson's disease patients without inducing the adverse effects that limit the clinical utility of current therapies." "BIIB014 has the potential to be a novel, non-dopaminergic treatment option for people living with Parkinson's disease. We are pleased with the advancement of this program, which is part of Biogen Idec's effort to extend our research and development capabilities beyond multiple sclerosis and into other neurological diseases," said Alfred Sandrock, MD, PhD, Senior Vice President, Neurology Research and Development, Biogen Idec. Phase I development of BIIB014 was successfully completed by Vernalis, with Biogen Idec now responsible for conducting and funding future development. Vernalis received a milestone payment of $3 million at the end of 2006 relating to the start of the Phase II programme and will receive additional milestones and royalties on the successful development and commercialisation of products. In addition, Vernalis has an option to co-promote products arising out of this collaboration in the U.S. (Last updated on Thursday, May 31, 2007, and first posted on Sunday, May 13, 2007) Send to a Friend Recently posted related articles on Parkinson's Disease : Parkinson's Disease :: Parkinson's disease risk increases with pesticide exposure & head trauma Parkinson's Disease :: Biogen Idec & Vernalis Plc starts trial of BIIB014 in Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's Disease :: FDA approves Neupro Patch for treatment of early Parkinson's disease Parkinson's Disease :: Link between Parkinson's disease and Narcolepsy Parkinson's Disease :: Depression may be early sign of Parkinson's disease Parkinson's Disease :: Blood test can diagnose and monitor treatment of Parkinson's disease Nanotechnology :: Nanotechnology offers hope for spinal cord injuries, diabetes & Parkinson's disease Parkinson's Disease :: Online gambling a risk for Parkinson's disease patients Parkinson's Disease :: Betting websites risky for gamblers with Parkinson's Disease Parkinson's Disease :: Coffee reduces Parkinson's disease risk Encyclopedia details on Parkinson's Disease best books on Parkinson's Disease books on Parkinson's Disease .

Police also arrested two others, one for his alleged involvement in the rapes, and another for selling a "considerable amount of drugs" including ecstasy and GHB. District police chief Ronald Zwarter talked to the Associated Press about the incidents, which took place in the northern city of Groningen. Said Zwarter: "The suspicion is that, at these parties, they had unsafe sex with people they had drugged, and also that these people were injected with infected blood. The motive to do this was the 'kick,' and the feeling that unsafe sex is 'pure'." According to the AP, "Prosecution spokesman Paul Heidanus said Thursday that the two who confessed would face charges of rape and "premeditated severe assault, which carries a maximum sentence of 16 years in prison. He said they would not be charged with attempted murder 'because of a Supreme Court ruling that found AIDS should no longer be seen as an inevitably fatal disease, but rather a chronic illness,' Heidanus said." : "Police began investigating the gay parties after receiving tips, some from AIDS groups. The police confiscated several liters of GHB, sometimes known as a 'rape drug' used to make people unconscious, as well as thousands of ecstasy pills, photographs and other evidence. A court in Groningen on Wednesday ordered the suspects to be held in prison for at least 90 days." According to a police statement, all the victims said they thought they had been infected with HIV: "The victims said they had had been made helpless or unconscious and then abused. They had ... involuntary and unsafe sex with one or more of the suspects." Authorities said there may be both further arrests, and more victims out there. Dutch police arrest 4 men in bizarre sex-crime investigation Yes...so pure. And rape is a compliment. Unreal. The logical next step from people who eroticize the RISK of barebacking? Okay, maybe not the next step. But seriously, to be that fixated on taboo sexual release that you're willing to do something like this, it's a great argument for abstinence. And there aren't many great arguments for abstinence. | May 31, 2007 9:08:33 AM Is Aids cured yet? Is an HIV person quarenteed to live to 80 years old? The death sentence that it is might be stretched out over a longer period of time and with less disc omfort BUT it is still a death sentence till they have a cure. The cocktails do not prolong one's life to the national average life span. It is F'd up to not prosecute these freaks of humanity for attempted murder. I would have no moral objections what so ever if the victims in this case resorted to some vigilante justice. You know that Pat robertson, focus on the family, and such are going to play this case up big time as an example of what they claim we all are and do. | May 31, 2007 9:16:59 AM Hopefully the men will be provided with post-exposure prophylaxis. They might still make it out of this OK. | May 31, 2007 9:37:21 AM Yes gabriel lets hope post-exposure prophyla to be effective, it must be started as soon as possible after exposure and ideally within an hour Idealy within 1 hour of exposure. That is not a large window especialy for guys who were drugged up. They probably didn't even realize what had happened till it was too late to be effective | May 31, 2007 9:49:59 AM I have no sympathy for the victims, I'm afraid. If you play with matches, you get burned. If you go to parties with drugs and diseased people, don't be surprised if something bad happens to you. Simple common sense..... | May 31, 2007 10:14:48 AM I just can't even read this. | May 31, 2007 10:51:15 AM This has got to be one of the most sick and twisted stories I have read in a long time, but to go to a sex party then claim you were raped? I'm sorry, I'm not buying it. Aren't sex and drugs, and yes, risky sexual behavior common and pretty much expected at a sex party? But to not charge them with some kind of crime for injecting them with HIV infected blood? That is just sick! Sick! Sick! Sick! | May 31, 2007 10:54:32 AM I can't even read comments like Brad's and Troy's. They must live in some sort of utopia where they ALWAYS make the right decisions (and people are raped just for attending a sex party). | May 31, 2007 11:04:21 AM I'm with you Brian, no sympathy for the alleged "victims." Anyone that goes to a "sex party" is playing with fire and should be ready to deal with the consequences, this sort of thing makes gay men look like some sort of freaks who can't control their sexual urges. | May 31, 2007 11:11:44 AM i can't believe what i'm reading? saying that they deserved this? who are these people writing comments? the phelps klan? | May 31, 2007 11:22:13 AM I have sympathy for the victims, unlike some here. Yes, risky bareback sex is common (but not ubiquitous) at sex parties, and yes, drug use is common (but not ubiquitous) at sex parties, but really, c'mon. They were (if we are to believe police accounts of the event) drugged into unconsciousness, raped by multiple men (yes, it WAS rape--obviously if they were unconscious or severely intoxicated they couldn't legally consent to sexual activity), and deliberately injected with HIV-positive blood for no other reason than to infect them. They weren't "bug chasers" or guys looking to be screwed roughly while in a drugged stupor, because if they were, they wouldn't have gone to the authorities after the incident. How can anyone NOT feel sympathy for them? Their behavior wasn't laudable but they didn't sign up for what happened to them. To shrug one's shoulders and say "they got what they deserved" or "what did they expect?" or something similar betrays an alarming callousness and deficit of compassion--something I'd expect from our right-wing enemies, not from fellow gay brothers. With gay "brothers" like some of the commenters here, who needs Fred Phelps and his gang? When did we gays become so harsh and cold and judgmental of our own? You might have a problem with sex parties and drug use, but when did those activities become rationalizations for rape and deliberate, nonconsensual infection with HIV? Have we come to hate life and each other that much? This all sounds creepily similar to the old saw that a woman deserved to be raped because she was wearing skimpy clothing...blech. | May 31, 2007 11:49:44 AM Rouquinricain......what do you expect? There are people still to this day who blame the woman for being raped and we already know there are a lot of stupid assholes who think rape is some form of erotic turn on. I might go to a sex party.....but no where does that give anyone the right to drug me, have sex with me without MY ok, and to inject me with what can still be a death sentance. Maybe the creeps above will crawl back into their slimy hole now. | May 31, 2007 11:50:46 AM Rouquinricain......what do you expect?

Washington, D.C. - infoZine - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Torisel (temsirolimus) for the treatment of a certain type of advanced kidney cancer known as renal cell carcinoma. Torisel was approved based on a study that showed use of the drug prolonged survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma. The drug is an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, cell growth and cell survival. "We have made significant advances in the battle against kidney cancer," said Steven Galson, M.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Torisel is the third drug approved for this indication in the past 18 months, and one that shows an increased time in survival for some patients." The approval of Torisel follows the December 2005 approval of Nexavar (sorafenib), which was based on a delay in progression of disease. In January 2006, Sutent (sunitinib) received accelerated approval based on durable response rate, or tumor size reduction, and was later demonstrated to delay tumor progression. The safety and effectiveness of Torisel were shown in a clinical trial of 626 patients divided into three groups. One group received Torisel alone, another received a comparison drug called Interferon alfa, and a third received a combination of Torisel and interferon. The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.9 months for patients on Torisel alone versus 7.3 months for those treated with the interferon alone. Progression-free survival (when the disease does not get worse) increased from 3.1 months on the interferon alone arm to 5.5 months on the Torisel alone arm. The combination of Torisel and interferon did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with interferon alone. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 30 percent of Torisel-treated patients, were rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema, and loss of appetite. The most common laboratory abnormalities were high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and triglycerides, elevated liver and kidney blood tests, and low red cell, white cell, and platelet counts. Renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in about 51,000 people annually in the United States, accounts for about 85 percent of all U.S. adult kidney cancer.

The level of wellness or health is, in part, determined by the ability to deal with and defend against stress. Health is determined by physiological, psychological, socio-cultural, spiritual, and developmental stage variables. Natural compound and exercise may boost memory Buy best Aging products from Amazon Aging :: Natural compound and exercise may boost memory A natural compound found in blueberries, tea, grapes and cocoa enhances memory in mice, according to newly published research. This effect increased further when mice also exercised regularly. "This finding is an important advance because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory-enhancing effects, suggesting that it may be possible to optimize brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation," says Mark Mattson, PhD, at the National Institute on Aging. The compound, epicatechin, is one of a group of chemicals known as flavonols and has been shown previously to improve cardiovascular function in people and increase blood flow in the brain. Flavonols are found in some chocolate. Henriette van Praag, PhD, of the Salk Institute, and colleagues there and at Mars, Inc., showed that the combination of exercise and a diet with epicatechin also promoted structural and functional changes in the dentate gyrus, a part of the brain involved in the formation of learning and memory. The findings, published in the May 30 issue of The Journal of Neuroscience , suggest that a diet rich in flavonols may help reduce the incidence or severity of neurodegenerative disease or cognitive disorders related to aging. Van Praag and her team compared mice fed a typical diet with those fed a diet supplemented with epicatechin. Half the mice in each group were allowed to run on a wheel for two hours each day. After a month, the mice were trained to find a platform hidden in a pool of water. Those that both exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice. When studying their brains, van Praag and her colleagues found that these mice had greater blood vessel growth in the dentate gyrus and had developed more mature nerve cells, suggesting an enhanced ability of the cells to communicate. Further analysis showed that the epicatechin and exercise combination had a beneficial effect on the expression of genes important for learning and memory, and decreased the activity of genes playing a role in inflammation and neurodegeneration. The researchers found that sedentary mice fed epicatechin showed enhanced memory, blood vessel growth, and gene activity, but these benefits were even more evident in mice that also exercised. "A logical next step will be to study the effects of epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals," says van Praag, "and then humans, combined with mild exercise."

Skip to next paragraph Dr. Martin S. Cetron at a news conference in Atlanta Wednesday. Back Story With The Times&#146;s Anahad OConnor ( TB Patient Is Isolated After Taking Two Flights The man is being detained under a federal isolation order in an Atlanta hospital for treatment of extremely resistant tuberculosis, which is often lethal. American officials and those in many other countries, meanwhile, are seeking to advise more than 100 passengers who sat closest to him on the longest flights and crew members to be tested for the infection. Health officials are also offering testing to hundreds of other passengers on the flights. It was the first airline-contact tracing investigation for extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, and it exposed many flaws that need to be fixed for future episodes, officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said at a news conference in Atlanta. While many infectious-disease experts and ethicists supported the agencys action, at least one strongly criticized it as over-reacting. Among the problems the agency identified were dealing with time zone differences; a lack of coordination between American and international authorities concerning how to medically isolate the man while he was abroad; and how to speed the retrieval of passenger manifests from airlines. The episode also raised questions about how rapidly health officials could respond to a similar emergency with other deadly infectious diseases. Even after the news conference, many other questions remained unanswered, including why it took health officials in Georgia so long to try to deliver a letter that explicitly told the man, whose identity was not disclosed, not to fly abroad for his honeymoon. In an interview published yesterday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the man disputed statements from disease agency officials about warnings it said Fulton County officials gave him about flying abroad. The agency said he was told not to fly. The man told the paper that Fulton County health officials said they preferred that he not go abroad for his honeymoon and did not advise him to take any precautions. There are different perspectives on who said what to whom when, said Dr. Martin S. Cetron, who directs agencys division of global migration and quarantine. It is very unfortunate that this whole situation wasnt prevented before the man flew with 432 other passengers and 18 crew members to Paris from Atlanta on Air France 385 on May 12, Dr. Cetron said. He took at least five flights within Europe and then flew with 190 other passengers and nine crew members from Prague to Montreal on Czech Air 104 on May 25. The Fulton County health department in Atlanta met with the man and his family on May 10, two days before he flew to Paris, and told them that he should not travel because he had multi-resistant tuberculosis, the disease agency said. No legal order was issued at the time, Dr. Cetron said in referring further questions to the Fulton County health department. Calls to the Fulton County health department yesterday were not returned. The extraordinary dangerous form of the tuberculosis was not detected until May 22, while he was in Europe. Dr. Cetron said that an agency officer telephoned the man in Rome and explicitly told him not to fly on a commercial plane  doctors believe prolonged exposure is needed to spread tuberculosis  while the agency worked out options to bring him back to the United States. They included an air ambulance. By the time a former disease agency doctor, who is working in Rome, arrived at the mans hotel, the couple had left, Dr. Cetron said. The agency was in the process of putting the mans name on a no-fly list. But by this time he had cut short his honeymoon that was supposed to last into June and was landing in Montreal. The efforts werent fast enough, Dr. Cetron said, adding that we certainly will be learning lessons and looking to improve current systems. The man drove to the United States and somewhere between Albany and New York spoke with Dr. Cetron, who instructed him on how to continue to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. There, he was isolated for 72 hours until the disease agency flew him in its plane to Atlanta on Monday. The man told the Atlanta paper that tuberculosis was detected by accident when he had a chest X-ray in January for another undisclosed problem.

'Subprime' Aftermath: Losing the Family Home Four Are Charged in Tax-Shelter Case Why Politicians Aren't Leery of Health Care Chinese Stocks Slide on Tax Increase Glaxo Letter Defends Avandia PLC defended Avandia in a letter published on the Lancet medical journal's Web site, pointing to three studies to argue that the diabetes drug is safe for the heart. Ronald Krall, chief medical officer, wrote in the letter that Glaxo did a "meta analysis" similar to the one conducted by Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Steven Nissen, whose article in the New England Journal of Medicine last week linked the drug to a potentially increased risk of heart attacks. Glaxo's own meta-analysis also found indications of increased risk, Dr. Krall wrote, but he said the number of adverse events was low. Dr. Krall also discussed results from two large Glaxo-funded studies of the drug. Neither trial, called Dream and Adopt, was designed primarily to assess the drug's heart risks. But Glaxo's analysis of the Adopt trial showed major adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, were "rare," and heart risks were similar to those of two other diabetes drugs. The Dream trial also showed "no significant difference" in cardiovascular events between the drug and placebo, the letter said. Meanwhile, an independent safety board recently reviewed an interim analysis of an ongoing study, Record, designed specifically to assess the drug's impact on the heart. The board determined the trial should continue, the Glaxo letter said. In an interview, Christopher Viehbacher, Glaxo's president of U.S. pharmaceuticals, said the trial's interim results were "giving us the confidence to say that we stand behind this product." He said there is a chance the interim results will become public before the Record trial is complete, though the trade-off would be that the publicity could weaken the statistical power of the final results. Mr. Viehbacher said it wouldn't surprise the company if the Food and Drug Administration were to call for "some labeling changes" for Avandia. One possibility would be elevating a heart-failure warning on the label to a more severe "black box" warning, he said. Dr. Nissen criticized Glaxo's letter to the Lancet, saying the company was slicing the data differently from the Adopt and Dream results originally published. Dr. Nissen also said the company was referring to such small subsets of data in the Adopt and Dream trials, that no firm conclusion could be drawn. "Somebody went back and looked for something that would support their contention," Dr. Nissen said. "This is not a scientifically proper way to analyze data." Mr. Viehbacher said that after Dr. Nissen's article was published last week, "we were shouting in a gale-force wind blowing against us." Now, he said, the public-relations situation was improving.

Now the European Union has told the food industry it has three years to make its products healthier or it could face stringent new regulations. Several British supermarkets have recently improved nutrional labeling on food products. The EU favors self-regulation by the food industry over legislation in efforts to fight obesity. In the popular European imagination, the bureaucrats of the European Union are seen as constantly interfering in citizens' diets, dictating the acceptable curvature of different classes of bananas and banning so-called "feta" cheese if it's not made in Greece. Now European Union officials are taking new steps to promote healthy eating in the 27-member bloc, warning producers of fatty foods to shape up -- or face regulation. European Union Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou Wednesday issued an ultimatum to Europe's food and drink industry, giving it three years to take action against obesity. "Industry must realize that time is running out if we are to get results at EU level," he told a news conference. "We have given them enough incentive to become more energetic and involved, or risk legislation." The EU wants the food industry to make a bigger effort to cut levels of sugar, fat and salt in processed foods. Kyprianou emphasized, however, that he prefered self-regulation by the industry over legislation, saying he believed it "gets quicker results." The European Commission also unveiled proposals Wednesday for revising nutrition labeling on food products, promoting healthy eating programs, and tightening advertising standards on unhealthy processed food. It also wants sports organizations to encourage youngsters to do more physical exercise.

More than 15 million people in the EU are technically obese or overweight, out of a total population of 490 million, while an estimated 3 million schoolchildren are now obese. The new plans follow the model of an "obesity platform" set up by the European Commission in 2005, which brings industry, consumer groups and health experts together in attempts to combat obesity and which favors self-regulation over a legislative approach. Consumer groups, who have called for a more pro-active approach from Brussels, were critical of the new initiatives. "It seems that the Commission has taken the easy way out by adopting a voluntary approach," said Jim Murray, director of the European consumers' organization BEUC. Unsurprisingly, groups representing the food industry welcomed the plans. "It's not about good and bad food, it's about good and bad diet," said David Zimmer, general secretary of the Association of the Chocolate, Biscuit and Confectionery Industries.

The level of wellness or health is, in part, determined by the ability to deal with and defend against stress. Health is determined by physiological, psychological, socio-cultural, spiritual, and developmental stage variables. Safety alert on Avandia - a timely action of FDA Buy best Avandia products from Amazon Avandia :: Safety alert on Avandia - a timely action of FDA The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety alert on Avandia, diabetes drug approved to treat type 2 diabetes. I believe safety alert on Glaxo's diabetes drug Avandia is a timely action by US FDA health agency, remarked Dr. Anil Singhal. Glaxo defended the drug safety of its diabetes drug Avandia saying "The suggestion that GlaxoSmithKline has placed patients at risk and attempted to silence independent investigation of data is absolutely false. Any fair examination of the companys record will show that GSK has been fully transparent in its efforts to thoroughly study the safety and effectiveness of Avandia, and to widely communicate that information to governments, scientists, physicians, and the public in the best interests of both patients and scientific debate." GSK strongly disagrees with the conclusions reached in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) article, which are based on incomplete evidence and a methodology that the author admits has significant limitations. Avandia was approved in 1999 for treatment of type 2 diabetes, a serious and life thr eatening disease that affects about 18 to 20 million Americans and more than 70 million people worldwide. Diabetes is a leading cause of coronary heart disease, blindness, kidney failure and limb amputation. Since the drug was approved, FDA has been monitoring several heart-related adverse events (e.g., fluid retention, edema and congestive heart failure) based on signals seen in previous controlled clinical trials of Avandia alone and in combination with other drugs, and from postmarketing reports. Just to hide Avandia's risk factors, Glaxo published a clinical study in late 2006, appreciating Avandia's clinical safety and performance in reducing blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients. Because of inadequate warnings about Avandia and massive advertising campaigns, its popularity has grown so that 11 million prescriptions were filled for the drug in the United States in 2006 alone. According to the American College of Cardiology, American Diabetes Association and American Heart Association, this NEJM study deserves serious thought and follow-up. As estimated here, the overall level of the risk associated with rosiglitazone appears to be small, but nonetheless one that must be considered carefully. In the meantime, patients using this drug should talk to their health care provider to determine the most appropriate course of action. Patients should not stop taking any prescribed medications without first discussing the issue with their health care provider. Further research will be needed in this area to provide conclusive evidence.

Surgery may benefit those with back pain: studies Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 10:52 AM ET Slipped disks and sciatica -- two of the most common causes of back problems -- can see more improvement with prompt surgery than with non-surgical remedies, two new studies in the New England Journal of Medicine One study looked at 283 patients with sciatica, a painful condition caused by displaced spinal disks putting pressure on the sciatic nerve, causing painful burning sensations or numbness. The condition resolves itself on its own without surgery about 75 per cent of the time. The patients underwent randomization either to early surgery (microdiskectomy) or to treatment of physical therapy and drugs, using surgery only if needed. Thirty-nine per cent of the 142 patients who were referred for conservative treatment had surgery after an average of 18.7 weeks. At a one-year follow-up, 95 per cent of all sciatica patients were free of pain whether they had surgery or not. There were no significant differences between the groups in pain, disability, and recovery scores. But the early-surgery group experienced quicker pain relief and a faster rate of self-perceived recovery. The second study looked at cases of slipped vertebra or slipped disk -- called degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis -- a condition in which one or more vertebra become misaligned and press on nerves in the spinal cord, resulting in leg pains. It generally occurs after the age of 50 and is seen six times more often in women than in men. The study, led by researchers at the Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire, found that surgery was twice as effective as non-surgical approaches in reducing pain and restoring functionality for patients. The study recruited 607 patients from 11 U.S. states who had at least 12 weeks of symptoms confirmed as DS. They were assigned to either a randomized cohort or an observational cohort. The results showed that 372 patients had surgery within two years (decompressive laminectomy, with or without fusion) and 235 had non-surgical treatments that included physical therapy, steroid injections, and pain relievers. Two years later, patients who had received surgical treatment reported significantly reduced pain and improved functionality as early as six weeks after intervention. Those who did not receive surgery reported only modest improvements. Although the study was designed to look at a randomized and an observational cohort, fully 40 per cent of participants who had been randomized later switched groups, resulting in substantial crossover between surgical and non-surgical groups. The authors chose to publish the results based on what treatment was actually received in each group. An accompanying editorial concludes: "Absent major neurologic deficits, patients with herniated disks, degenerative spondylolisthesis, or spinal stenosis do not need surgery, but the appropriate surgical procedures may provide valuable pain relief. "In such situations, decisions should be made jointly by well-informed patients and their physicians."

A study found that women who snacked on the superfood up to four times a day saw their levels of bad cholesterol drop, and they also had healthier blood pressure readings. Soy nuts, which are similar to peanuts, are made from whole soya beans soaked in water and baked. Researchers in Boston, USA, recruited 60 post­menopausal women with blood pressures ranging from healthy to high. Half were asked to follow a diet getting 30 per cent of calories from fat, 15 per cent from protein and 55 per cent from carbohydrates. It also included two portions per week of oily fish and 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. The other women were told to adopt the same diet but replace 25 grammes of the protein with half a cup of soy nuts a day. After eight weeks, those with high blood pressure who ate nuts saw their top systolic blood pressure drop by almost 10 per cent. Low diastolic readings dropped by an average 6.8 per cent. Soy contains isoflavones, also thought to ward off osteoporosis and protect against breast and colon cancer. &#9679;Pregnant women are warned to take iron supplements only if they are anaemic because they can raise blood pressure and result in smaller babies.

First Read is updated throughout the day, so check back often. , NBC Political Director , NBC Deputy Political Director How they roll (out) Posted: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 4:24 PM by Mark Murray From NBC's Carrie Dann In the wake of Obama's big policy pitch yesterday, the worlds of print and pixel are crowded with side-by-side comparisons of the Democratic front-runners' plans for universal health care reform. It's certainly worthwhile to parse the details of the three plans -- their costs, their options, and their requirements. But there's something to be said for zooming out from the play-by-play to look at how each of the heavy hitters choose to present their big policy plans. And there's even a lot to learn by just hitting the "mute" button (and not for the reasons that their GOP rivals might enthusiastically suggest). Since hitting the trail in earnest, each of the top three Democratic candidates have touted rollouts on health care, the economy, and a handful of other sweeping topics. Each has addressed a tough topic on friendly turf. ( talked foreign policy in hometown Chicago; talked about health-care costs a stone's throw away from the Capitol Dome; and Southerner unveiled his big health-care plan in Charleston, SC.) Other than the locale, a catchy phrase -- preferably two words -- is a key component to the "major policy address." Compare Obama's Rockwellian "American Moment" to Clinton's risky "Shared Prosperity," which set GOP blogs ablaze yesterday with allusions to Red China. Unsurprisingly, the meticulous Clinton outlines her plans like an infomercial ad wizard; her economic plan was nine steps, and her talk about health care was seven. And it's worth noting that Clinton and Obama tend to stay entrenched behind podiums for the heavy lifting, while Edwards broke the mold by introducing his health-care plan in a town-hall format and by fielding questions after his health-care rollout. Every new health care reform plan proposed would just jam the system. The only plan good would be to scrap the entire system and go for universal health care. But then, the media would start pushing out the false nightmarish stories of health system of Canada and Britain, without mentioning that among all developed nations US has the lowest life expectancy (77.4) while Canada's is 80.0 and UK's is 78.4, and US spends the most in percentage (15%) of its GNP for its health care system. And also the per capita spending on health in US is 5117 (the highest among all the nations), compared to 2998 in canada and 2317 in UK. Where does all this money goes, in the coffers of the insurance companies and their officers. The health care system of this country is nothing but a fraud. What we want in this country are more educated people, people who are willing to form their opinions based on real facts, not people who would rather have decisions made for them by the corporations and their political and media stooges. (Sent Wednesday, May 30, 2007 9:08 PM) MM,MA. What is your proof of the "false, nightmarish stories"? Please clarify, because unlike yourself I am willing to bet I have seen socialized medicine up close and personal. And it is indeed a nightmare. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 6:12 AM) A nightmare is when you don't have health insurance and make too much money to get any government help, and you don't make enouph money to pay $1500.00 a day for a hospital stay. Or maybe $20,000.00 for a surgery. Sell you home and everything you have. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 9:52 AM) In Europe workers are taxed anywhere from 49-51 percent of their income to provide "free" medical care and they still wait months to get into see a doctor who has been working 14-16 hours. I don't see how people think that is such a great system. Unless of course you are one of the âaustlandarsâ (Russians, Poles, Turks, ect), who donât work and pay taxes. Europe, Germany in particular can not keep up with the mounting costs of "free" health care, free education, free child care, ect, and there is a tax payer revolt coming. Europeâs âfreeâ health care is failing. What makes Hillarity or Obama think Sorosâ dream of socialized health care is going to work for the US? I'm telling you I am seeing it first hand everyday, and do matter how good they make it sound, it is a crappy, expensive, system that will dummy health care down to it's lowest possible denominator. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 10:36 AM) Rick, Germany, Maybe you are right. you are experiencing it , I'm not. I do know that something has to change here. This system is no longer working. (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 11:23 AM) Not working, and WAY TOO DAMN EXPENSIVE! My girlfriend just had a D&C done after an planned pregnancy that aborted itself. The entire procedure took less than 20 minutes, but cost $6500.00, and with 3 people in the room! What a RIPOFF!!!!! I Want To Make $6,000 per Hour, Too.... (Sent Thursday, May 31, 2007 11:55 AM) Amazing, how the multimillionaires can talk about "free" or socialized medical care when they will never have to use it. No, they will never have to wait for months to get an appointment or wait for an available hospital bed. The answer is for more affordable care. I have insurance, but for what I get and what I pay, it is still very, very expensive. I recently had an accident and still ended up paying (out-of-pocket) a fortune for the difference between "acceptable to the insurance company" and what the hospital charged. Everyone should be eligible for affordable insurance. A relative recently was declared disabled and was put on Medicaid. When he got his statement, there were "discounts" given because of the medicaid. Apparently, there is difference in what medicaid patients and someone with insurance is charged-a big difference.

According to Science Daily , scientists in Auckland, New Zealand, have bred a skim-milk producing cow successfully. In addition to producing milk that is skim, the milk from this cow also has other benefits. Plans are in the making for creating herds of this type of cow, now that research shows it can be done. ViaLactia, the biotech firm responsible for breeding the cow, says it will target health-conscious consumers with their marketing campaigns. In addition to the milk being naturally skim (low in fat content), the milk also has other benefits. It has a normal level of protein, differing from skim milk that is manufactured. Russel Snell, the chief scientist at ViaLactia told UPI ( quoted on Science Daily ) about the original cow "She produces a normal level of protein in her milk but substantially less fat, and the fat she does produce has much more unsaturated fat. She also produces milk with very high levels of omega3 oils." Protein is essential for hair and nails. They are made up of mostly protein. All cells require protein. It is used to build tissue and also to repair it. Protein is used in making enzymes, hormones, and other essential body chemicals. This milk could also be great for heart health because according to the , "Replacing some carbohydrates with protein and unsaturated fat may enhance heart health benefits". The Omega3 Oils, usually found in fish and soy products, are also heart healthy. These oils are highly recommended by the The original cow was found by ViaLactia in 2001, but it was recently evidenced that she passed the skim-milk producing trait on to her calves. With this success, it is a marketable product as the calves can then also be bred to create a herd, which in turn could create more and more of these skim-milk producing cows in accordance with product demand. Snell says "You have to generate daughters and then they have to carry a calf and deliver milk. The eureka moment was when we found her daughters produced milk like their mother."

Parirenyatwa and Harare hospitals in the capital and Mpilo and Bulawayo central hospitals in Bulawayo have closed most departments, leaving only the casualty wings, and are operating with skeleton staff, as health professionals and aides fail to turn up for work due to low salaries. Sources at the government hospitals said the situation was worsening every week, with no sign of a solution in sight. Officials said the maternity wing at Parirenyatwa Hospital was closed last weekend, compelling expectant mothers to turn to expensive private hospitals. Many more, however, have resorted to fly-by-night maternity homes in the high-density suburbs, where sanitary conditions are said to be appalling. Edwin Muguti, the deputy Health Minister, admitted the situation at hospitals was critical. But he insisted the government was working to minimise inconveniencing patients. "There has been no improvement since the workers stopped coming to work. But we are trying our best to keep the hospitals open and fully functional," said Muguti. "We are doing something for the workers, including nurses and doctors, but we fear our efforts as far as awarding better salaries and working conditions are concerned are being eroded by inflation. The problem is the economic difficulties we are facing." Angry stakeholders who called The Financial Gazette yesterday reported that staff at Parirenyatwa and Harare hospitals were only attending to emergencies. The situation in Harare has been compounded by the closure of almost all municipal clinics due to a lack of personnel, drugs and equipment. In Bulawayo, the situation at Mpilo Central Hospital was yesterday reported to be serious. A skeleton staff consisting entirely of trainees was said to be attending to emergency cases. Things were no different at Bulawayo Central Hospital. In February, the government tried to mollify health workers by announcing two salary increments within a month after a crippling six-week strike. Nurses were awarded an additional $263 000 on top of their improved January salaries of $195 000, bringing their monthly earnings to between $458 000 and $500 000. Wards visited by this newspaper at Parirenyatwa and Harare hospitals yesterday were deserted, with nurse aides, administration and general staff having stayed away. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa admitted earlier this month that health workers could no longer afford bus fares to and from work. On a salary of $500 000, a nurse needs to pay an average of $840 000 in bus fares per month. &copy; 2007 Financial Gazette. All rights reserved. Distributed by AllAfrica Global Media ( ).

Barack Obama (D-IL) at a May campaign stop in New Orleans. Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY) speaks with supporters during a meeting at the Lincoln Elementary School in Charles City, Iowa. May 29, 2007 &middot; Health care is taking center stage in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. In Iowa City on Tuesday, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama unveiled a comprehensive plan to provide health coverage to every American. Obama's speech comes just days after rival Sen. Hillary Clinton presented the first part of her health plan at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. If Obama's plan to cover everyone &mdash; which he's been promising since January &mdash; has a familiar ring to it, it may be because it borrows from a long list of Democratic plans of the past, including those put forward by President Clinton, as well as the last two Democratic presidential nominees, former Vice President Al Gore and Massachusetts senator John Kerry. Among other things, it would expand public insurance programs for the poor, provide subsidies for private insurance for the middle class, and create a health-insurance exchange to oversee the private insurance market. "If you are one of the 45 million Americans who don't have health insurance, after this plan becomes law, you will have health insurance available to you," he said in a speech at the University of Iowa. "No one will be turned away because of a pre-existing condition or illness. Everyone will be able buy into a new health insurance plan that's similar to the one that every federal employee &mdash; from a postal worker in Iowa to a congressman in Washington &mdash; currently has for themselves." Obama would pay for his plan in a variety of ways: by letting President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthy expire; by requiring most businesses to pay a share of worker premiums; and by focusing on prevention and wringing inefficiencies out of the current system. That latter part is almost identical to the seven-point cost-cutting plan laid out last week by fellow candidate and senator Hillary Clinton. "The money we save from the waste we eliminate and the way we change how we care for people should be used to help finance coverage for the 45 million Americans who have no insurance," Clinton told an audience of mostly health professionals at George Washington University. "Also, when you insure everyone, it will maximize the impact of the prevention programs I have recommended &mdash; with early care as opposed to emergency care &mdash; as well as cutting administrative costs," she said. Clinton's speech last week focused solely on costs. She said future speeches will address health care quality and insurance coverage for all Americans. But Clinton and Obama aren't the only Democratic candidates with full-scale health plans. Former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards put out his plan to cover everyone in February. Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich is a longtime sponsor of the so-called single-payer plan that would have the government replace private insurance. Harvard School of Public Health professor Robert Blendon says he would be surprised if the Democratic candidates weren't talking a lot about health care. "To Democratic primary voters, health care is the core of what it means to be a Democrat," he said. "They really think today that government has to do something to help them with their situation." Republican primary voters, by contrast, tend to worry more about taxes and security. Which may help explain the peculiar case of former Massachusetts Republican governor Mitt Romney. He rarely talks about health care on the GOP presidential campaign trail. Yet he signed the bipartisan health coverage law that's now the basis for many of the national Democrats' plans. Meanwhile, Drew Altman, president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, says all the big health plans being offered by the Democrats may in the end just cancel one another out. While experts will be able to see the differences between each candidate's plan for information technology or chronic disease management, voters will likely just note that each candidate has a big health plan. "And if any candidate gains an edge on health, I think it will be the candidate that convinces the voters that they can finally forge a consensus that can finally get something done and get something passed in the Congress," Altman says. Of course, that assumes the public will prefer the Democrats' approach to the more free-market approach to health care that's likely to be pushed by the Republican nominee. &#187; Up to twelve addresses, separated by commas.

Jackie Calmes, Wall Street Journal WASHINGTON -- During the 13 years since President Bill Clinton lost his bid to remake the U.S. health-care system, and helped cost his party control of Congress in the bargain, politicians have shied from changing it more than one step at a time even as costs and the ranks of uninsured have ballooned. Now, the growing list of Democratic presidential candidates calling for universal, cheaper coverage -- Illinois Sen. Barack Obama yesterday became the latest -- suggests the days of health-care incrementalism are over. Nor are these Democrats alone in embracing the once-toxic political cause of universal care: The best-known state models have been championed by Republican governors, including Mitt Romney of Massachusetts, who is now running for president. This shift reflects rising and inflation-topping out-of-pocket costs for health care and insurance premiums, co-payments and deductibles. Also, the number of uninsured has spiked to about 45 million, from 37 million when Mr. Clinton was president. Business leaders increasingly are seeking a government-imposed solution, saying employee health costs put them at a disadvantage with foreign competitors. Those forces, in turn, have combined to embolden politicians in both parties to once again propose universal health care that inevitably would mean a big role for government -- and possibly upend the powerful insurance, medical and pharmaceutical industries. Mr. Obama's speech unveiling his initiative in Iowa, the state with the first nominating contest, comes a week after Sen. Hillary Clinton of New York proposed health-cost savings as an integral part of a later plan specifically aimed at covering uninsured Americans. The third candidate in Democrats' top tier of White House contenders, former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, beat both to the punch with a detailed universal-coverage plan in early February. In Congress, Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Republican Bob Bennett of Utah have drafted a bill to overhaul the nation's health system. It isn't expected to get off the ground during the current Congress and the remainder of George Bush's presidency, though, given the president's belief in market forces and opposition to government regulation. Moreover, he and the Democrat-led Congress are locked in battle over Iraq. The public likewise is preoccupied with war, polls show, but health care has re-emerged as voters' top domestic concern. Indeed, the political center on the issue seems to have shifted so much that the health-insurance industry, which undermined the Clinton plan with commercials featuring middle-class couple "Harry and Louise" ridiculing the big bureaucracy it would create, openly supports a federal role in universal coverage. The industry strategy is to shape the result rather than to fight it. Mohit Ghose, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the successor group to the one that fought the Clintons, yesterday said, "The most important thing for us is that there are plans out there." The group's own proposal for universal health care, unveiled after Democrats won control of Congress, focuses on increasing federal subsidies for insurance, and avoids new mandates or regulations. The Republican Party also is adjusting to voters' openness to a government role in making health-care more affordable and accessible, with the goal of putting its imprint on any changes. "Republicans have an opportunity to lead on health care by promoting broad-based reform consistent with our principles: consumer choice, market incentives, technology," said former Republican Party Chairman Ken Mehlman. Republican candidates nonetheless will likely try to blast Democrats for using universal care to boost the size of government and to raise taxes. But they have yet to engage: The Web site of former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani doesn't list health care among his top 10 issues. Big employers, while eager for help with the growing burden of employee health costs, are reserving judgment on early proposals. The Business Roundtable, an association of chief executives that recently joined with the seniors organization AARP and the service-employees union to press for a bipartisan solution, issued a statement welcoming Mr. Obama's effort "to focus the nation's attention on this critical issue." Despite the renewed interest in taking on health care, though, no one is talking about an overhaul as ambitious as the 1993-94 Clinton plan -- not even its architect, Mr. Clinton's wife. The Clintons proposed a complex and heavily regulated system based on a mandate for employers to provide health insurance to all employees, and the creation of powerful insurance-purchasing agencies as go-betweens for consumers and health providers. Now, as Mrs. Clinton campaigns for president, a staple of her speeches is a self-deprecating nod to the scars she bears from that fight -- and assurance that, as she puts it, "I know what not to do." For one thing, Mrs. Clinton says this time she will seek consensus before moving ahead. While her preference, and that of many Democratic voters, would be a Medicare-style plan for all, she tells audiences it wouldn't be possible to get such a system passed in Congress. Both the Obama and Edwards plans would work within the current private-insurance system, and mandate that all but the smallest employers either provide health coverage to their workers, or contribute to a pool for the uninsured. But unlike Mr. Edwards, Mr. Obama wouldn't mandate that individuals purchase insurance. Given that option, both the Edwards and Clinton camps said the Obama plan wouldn't achieve universal coverage as advertised, since many Americans -- especially the healthy and young -- won't buy policies unless required to do so, thereby keeping premiums and other costs higher. Obama advisers insisted that as the cost-saving proposals in his plan in turn reduce the costs of insurance, individuals would buy it; if a President Obama found after several years that some share of Americans remained uninsured, "he'd revisit" the issue, they said. At the same time, the Obama aides questioned whether Mr. Edwards's plan would accomplish universal coverage; they cited his plan's caveat that individuals wouldn't be mandated to have insurance until it becomes affordable. To help pay for their plans, both Messrs. Obama and Edwards would end the Bush tax cuts for the rich, typically said to be those making more than $200,000 a year. That would translate into revenue upward of $65 billion a year, depending on which cuts are eliminated. Under the Obama plan, the federal government would cover some costs for catastrophic illnesses that account for a huge share of expenses. The senator said this would lead to reduced premiums. He also would mandate that all children be insured, and would expand both Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program to cover more poor families. States would be able to continue implementing their own plans, as long as they met new minimum coverage standards. People up to age 25 could continue to be covered under parents' policies. Mr. Obama would create a National Health Insurance Exchange, described in campaign documents as "a watchdog group" that would be empowered to set rules and standards "to make individual coverage more affordable and accessible." While now more willing to accept a government role than they were a decade ago, insurers, as well as pharmaceutical companies, aren't likely to support his proposal any more than they did the 1994 Clinton plan that Republicans still deride as "Hillary-Care." And Mr. Obama, despite his reputation as someone who brings all sides together, yesterday repeatedly lambasted both industries for profiteering and killing all past attempts at change. "It's time to bring together businesses, the medical community, and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis, and it's time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while they'll get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair," Mr. Obama said. Aside from insurers and drug makers, losers would include the wealthiest Americans who would forfeit their tax cuts. Winners, supporters say, would be the 45 million uninsured, as well as everyone else who would see lower health costs. Mr. Obama claimed a family of four on average would save $2,500 a year. To help bring down costs, all three Democratic candidates aim to have insurers cover more preventive care to avert expensive illnesses. And they would have the government subsidize health providers' investments in technology, which they claim could squeeze out big savings, though some experts question how much.

But Glaxo later fought back, persuading UK medical journal to publish a letter online today which stressed that an on-going long term detailed study of Avandia - known as ADOPT- had so far shown that the risks of heart problems with Avandia were no worse that those with two other drugs used for diabetes. The shares at first lost 29p to &pound;12.27, making a total loss in the past few days of &pound;2.30 per share, or &pound;13.3 billion - 13 per cent of market value - but bounced back in afternoon trading once Glaxo publicised its letter and ended up 22p at 1328p. Avandia is Glaxo's No 2 best selling medicine after the asthma drug Advair, but Glaxo has now lost more than &pound;13 billion in value or 13 per cent in the past nine days since research published in the New England Journal of Medicine indicated that Avandia increased the risks of heart attack by 43 per cent and the risks of death by other causes by 64 per cent, although the leading cardiologist behind the research, Dr Steven Nissen, acknowledged that more studies are needed. Glaxo comment: More pain Sales of Glaxo's diabetes drug nosedive &lsquo;I was truly frightened on behalf of our patients&rsquo; Merrill Lynch told clients this morning in a that while it concurs with the view that Avandia's heart attack risks are scientifically questionable, the resultant publicity will further hurt sales of the drug and Glaxo's share price. "The overhang to both Avandia sales and GSK share price is likely to remain for the forseeable future." said analyst Graham Parry. He cut forecast earnings per share for 2008 by 2 per cent and by 7 per cent for 2012. He said the concerns raised were unlikely to be either firmly refuted or proven until the publication of a key safety study in 2009. "In the intervening period, the stock will likely remain under pressure as both Avandia safety and Glaxo's reputiaton are placed under intense public scrutiny." Congressional hearings are set for June 6 and there will be a hearing before the Food and Drug Administration panel in July or August. Yesterday broker Deutsche Bank cited a report by pharmaceutical research firm , which showed that Avandia's market share of new prescription had fallen from 10 per cent to around zero in two days after the article was published. Deutsche said: "While two days of prescription data cannot be regarded as a rigorous test of clinician sentiment to the NEJM article...this reaction is far worse than we had anticipated and suggests that there could be as much as 22 per cent downside risk to GSK's near term earnings." Glaxo has said that its own studies, shared with regulators, were more detailed than Dr Nissen's research and showed no greater risk of heart attacks than rival drugs or placebos. It also said yesterday that two days of sales data was not enough to establish a trend. * Town / City Save to my times GlaxoSmithKline defends Avandia as shares drop 13% in nine days The bigger they are, the bigger the side-effects MPs poised to intervene in Boots pension row Also in Industry Sectors Hungry Blackstone pays &pound;140m for Strada Kwik Save to meet union officials BP's criticised refining head John Manzoni quits Government to raise &pound;2.2bn from British Energy Chinese tax move sends markets lower BP: from hate to love in Russia Special Report by Peter Koenig on how Lord Browne bet all on a Russian bandit Your Browser doesn't support Inline frames Find out who has joined the club with the &pound;70 million entrance fee Your Browser doesn't support Inline frames Tailor-made section with features and news for the Business Traveller Overseas contacts and local information for your business Keep up with the coming week's key events She relied on an oxygen machine.

The FDA approval was based on the results of a clinical trial published today in the New England Journal of Medicine The trial showed that patients who were given Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival of about three and a half months compared with patients who were only on interferon. Torisel belongs to a class of drugs that inhibit enzymes that control the production, growth and survival of cells. More specifically, it inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase, commonly known as mTOR, a protein kinase that controls cell growth, proliferation, motility, and survival. mTOR also regulates protein synthesis and transcription. Director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Dr Steven Galson said: "We have made significant advances in the battle against kidney cancer." "Torisel is the third drug approved for this indication in the past 18 months, and one that shows an increased time in survival for some patients," he added. In December 2005 the FDA approved sorafenib (Bayer's Nexavar), followed by sunitinib (Pfizer's Sutent) in January 2006. The Torisel multicentre phase 3 trial took 626 patients and randomly assigned them to three groups. One group was given Torisel alone, another was given interferon alfa (Roche's Roferon-A) and the third group received Torisol and interferon combined. None of the patients had been treated before the trial and they had all received a poor prognosis for metastatic renal-cell carcinoma. The median overall survival for patients receiving Torisel alone was 10.9 months compared with 7.3 months for those who received only the interferon. Also, progression-free survival in the Torisel alone group was 5.5 months compared to 3.1 months in the interferon alone gruop. The Torisel and interferon combined group did not show a significant increase in overall survival compared to the interferon alone group. The researchers concluded that: "As compared with interferon alfa, temsirolimus improved overall survival among patients with metastatic renal-cell carcinoma and a poor prognosis. The addition of temsirolimus to interferon did not improve survival." The most common side effects among the Torisel patients included rash, fatigue, nausea, edema, loss of appetite and mouth sores. This occurred in at least 30 per cent of the patients who received the drug. The most common abnormalities as shown by laboratory tests included high levels of blood sugar, lipids and triglycerides, plus elevated kidney and liver blood tests, with lower than normal red cell, white cell and blood platelet counts. Renal cell carcinoma accounts for around 85 per cent of the 51,000 people affected by adult kidney cancer in the US every year.

The infant, weighing between one to three pounds died from bacteremia - commonly known as blood poisoning - after acquiring serratia, a harmful pathogen that causes severe infections in babies, a hospital spokesperson said. The hospital's level 3 neonatal unit, where the most fragile babies are admitted, was closed Wednesday night while level 2 was reopened. Special infection control procedures are in place in the rest of the neonatal ward,Â including improved hand hygiene and the wearing of gowns and gloves.

Marge has been identified in a herd in New Zealand by scientists who are trying to revolutionize the dairy industry. They want cows that produce low-fat milk and butter that spreads straight from the fridge. So they're thrilled about Marge, the Guardian newspaper science correspondent reports this week. Marge's milk is low in saturated fat and high in polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat. Scientists figure they can get a whole herd of Marges by 2011. Who's behind this hunt for low-cal cows? The biotech company ViaLactia, which set their scientists the task of screening milk from its own herd of 4 million cows. ViaLactia is a subsidiary of New Zealand's largest dairy co-op and the world's largest exporter of dairy products. Which explains their bias about cows.

Investors took comfort in news and in the company bounced off two- year lows to end higher on the day. Before recovering late this afternoon, the had lost 13 pct in the wake of safety fears prompted by an article earlier this week in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM), erasing 9 bln stg from the company's market value. A pooled or meta-analysis of data from 42 clinical trials concluded that Avandia increased the risk of heart attack by 43 pct, and cardiac related death by 64 pct. While the authors admitted that the methodology has significant limitations, an editorial in the journal called for regulators to withdraw the drug, Glaxo's second-biggest selling product. Europe's biggest drug maker has always strongly disagreed with the findings, and today published new evidence in a letter to The Lancet. Glaxo's chief medical officer Ronald Krall pointed out that the NEJM's analysis omitted the total percentage number of events. The number of heart attacks happened at a very low frequency, 0.6 pct for both Avandia and control groups. He added that further analyses from two long-term clinical trials, conducted since the article was published, showed that the incidence of cardiovascular events with Avandia is comparable to the two gold standard medicines used to treat type 2 diabetes, and to a placebo pill. Meanwhile, findings from a soon-to-be-published study, using a database of more than 30,000 diabetes patients, show the incidence of hospitalisations for heart attack or heart surgery for patients on Avandia is the same as for other diabetes treatments, the company announced. Glaxo has been conducting a large long-term study to specifically study the risk of heart attack associated with the drug since 2002, which will report in 2009. A safety monitoring board reviewed an interim analysis of the data, and determined that the study should be allowed to continue, Krall pointed out today. The Food and Drug Administration will review the drug in the next few months and the company faces a congressional hearing in the US on June 6. Concerns that the furore will prevent doctors from prescribing the treatment to new patients has prompted many analysts to downgrade sales and Merrill Lynch cut its recommendation on the stock to 'sell' from 'neutral' today, saying that it only sees 'downside' as a result of the concerns, and forecast no near-term growth in the product. Fears of potential litigation by patients have also contributed to the stock's decline. However other brokers, such as Collins Stewart, have retained 'buy' recommendations and believe the fall has been overdone. The Lancet itself has already publicly highlighted the drawbacks to the NEJM study, and called for a 'calmer and more considered' approach. Analyst Paul Diggle at Nomura Code Securities, which has also kept a 'buy' rating on Glaxo, said the reaffirmation of the data this afternoon likely helped the stock recover. And the reassurance from another party, not just financial analysts, that the situation has been overblown may have provided some comfort. 'The Lancet clearly doesn't feel particularly happy with the way the New England Journal reported it, and the combination of having another journal cast aspersions on what the New England Journal has done, plus Glaxo reaffirming the data, has helped,' he commented. Glaxo shares closed at 1,328, 22 pence or 1.7 pct higher. The stock fell to 1,269 earlier. Copyright AFX News Limited 2007. All rights reserved.

Some dermatologists say you can also drink your way to healthy skin. Drinking just one cup of tea a day can lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer, squamous and basal cell carcinoma, reported the Journal of the American Academy Of Dermatology. In a study of more than 2,000 people, tea's antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays. It doesn't matter if the tea is hot or cold, and all types of tea offered protection. But doctors warn that tea isn't the cure-all. Remember to cover up and wear sunscreen. . All rights reserved.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Obama Says Washington Is Ready for Health Plan Anne E. Kornblut and Perry Bacon Jr. Washington Post Staff Writers Wednesday, May 30, 2007; Page A05 IOWA CITY, May 29 -- ) echoed familiar Democratic themes on Tuesday in calling on businesses, insurance companies and lawmakers to reject the "failed politics" of past debates and overhaul the nation's health-care system to cover every American. Obama, who is among the front-runners for the Democratic presidential nomination, offered few new ideas in laying out his plan to expand health insurance and to greatly reduce health-care costs. Instead, he cast his proposal in the themes that have defined his candidacy: optimism and a desire to move beyond partisan politics. He offered ideas that have long been proposed to solve one of the country's most vexing problems: increasing subsidies for those who cannot afford insurance but do not qualify for public programs, spending more federal money on disease prevention and making health records electronic. Democratic presidential hopeful U.S. Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., speaks during a Memorial Day reception with veterans Monday in Davenport, Iowa. (Charlie Neibergall - AP) | Barack and Michelle Obama along with their daughters Sasha, 5, and Malia, 8, made campaign stops across northern N.H. over the Memorial Day weekend. John W. Poole / washingtonpost.com Check out this guide to all the Democrats and Republicans who are running (or are likely to run) for president next year. Save & Share Article "We now face an opportunity -- and an obligation -- to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterday's health-care debates," Obama told a crowd of medical professionals. "It's time to bring together businesses, the medical community and members of both parties around a comprehensive solution to this crisis, and it's time to let the drug and insurance industries know that while they'll get a seat at the table, they don't get to buy every chair." Referring to the failed effort of Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton ), one of his 2008 campaign rivals, to reform health care in the early 1990s, Obama said that achievements nationwide in recent years by Democratic and Republican governors show that expanding health care is no longer too politically dangerous. "We can do this," he said. "The climate is far different than it was the last time we tried this, in the early '90s." The proposal, part of a series of speeches Obama has given over the past several weeks after he faced criticism from some party activists for speaking too much about his popular themes of hope and optimism rather than policy plans, in many ways resembles the ideas of some of his challengers. It comes as all the Democratic candidates, looking for advantage in a tight primary contest, are trying to find ideas that will connect best with liberals who want to see more aggressive action in expanding health care and ending the war in ), who outlined his health-care goals in February, Obama would pay for his plan, which could cost more than $50 billion, by increasing taxes for people earning more than $250,000 and reversing tax cuts that approved. Obama would require almost all employers to offer insurance to workers or face a tax penalty, an idea that many businesses abhor and that is also in Edwards's proposal. This employer mandate drove much of the opposition to the Clinton plan in 1994. Like Clinton, who in a speech last week laid out some of her health-care ideas, Obama is focused as much on reducing the costs for those who are insured as on expanding coverage to the estimated 45 million Americans who are not. He called for the federal government to pay part of the costs for patients with chronic illnesses, so that employers would not have to do so, but also emphasized the importance of preventive care. It is important to "listen to our wives when they tell us to stop smoking," he said, referring to his own unhealthy habit. Like many Democratic politicians, he blamed drug and health insurance companies for stopping the passage of more expansive health-care proposals. The lack of new ideas in Obama's health plan in part reflects his approach. He has emphasized his freshness as a rationale for his candidacy, but that freshness has been much more about his tone and his rhetoric about hope and bipartisanship than his policy proposals, which have largely mirrored those of his 2008 rivals and the ideas that Sen. John F. Kerry (D-Mass.) offered in the 2004 presidential race. One concept that Obama's plan does not include is a popular idea from both Democrats and Republicans who work on health-care issues: an "individual mandate" that would require every American to buy health insurance. A landmark plan that was approved in last year made such a requirement, and without it, health experts say, Obama's plan is unlikely to create universal health coverage, although his advisers estimated that it would provide insurance to almost all Americans. Edwards's proposal calls for such a mandate and Clinton is likely to include it in hers as well, her advisers said. Obama would require only that all children have health coverage. The Clinton and Edwards campaigns quickly criticized Obama for not offering a plan that would require insurance for all. "Any plan that does not cover all Americans is simply inadequate," said Mark Kornblau, an Edwards spokesman. Obama's advisers argued that such a mandate is less important than adding subsidies and other ways to make health care more affordable. The senator's aides estimated that his plan would save the average family $2,500 per year and would allow those without insurance to buy it through a new health-care option that would resemble the one federal employees can choose. They said it would create a national health entity from which people could buy private insurance plans. "The key is not the mandate," said David Cutler, an economics professor at , who advised Obama on the plan. "It's the affordability and the accessibility." Obama's allies described his proposal as far-reaching and achievable. Obama made a similar argument, telling the crowd in that voters are tired of candidates who "offer up detailed health-care plans with great fanfare and promise, only to see them crushed under the weight of Washington politics and drug-insurance-industry lobbying once the campaign is over."

The American Heart Association estimates that high blood pressure (hypertension) affects approximately 50 million Americans and 1 billion individuals worldwide. The most common-and deadly-result is coronary heart disease, according to background information in the article. Women with high blood pressure have four times the risk of heart disease as women with normal blood pressure. Francine K. Welty, M.D., Ph.D., and colleagues at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston, assigned 60 healthy post-menopausal women to eat two diets for eight weeks each in random order. The first diet, the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, consisted of 30 percent of calories from fat (with 7 percent or less from saturated fat), 15 percent from protein and 55 percent from carbohydrates; 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day; two meals of fatty fish (such as salmon or tuna) per week; and less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol per day. The other diet had the same calorie, fat and protein content, but the women were instructed to replace 25 grams of protein with one-half cup of unsalted soy nuts. Blood pressure and blood samples for cholesterol testing were taken at the beginning and end of each eight-week period. According to Eurekalert, the news service of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, at the beginning of the study, 12 women had high blood pressure (140/90 milligrams of mercury or higher) and 48 had normal blood pressure. "Soy nut supplementation significantly reduced systolic [top number] and diastolic [bottom number] blood pressure in all 12 hypertensive women and in 40 of the 48 normotensive women," the authors write. "Compared with the TLC diet alone, the TLC diet plus soy nuts lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure 9.9 percent and 6.8 percent, respectively, in hypertensive women and 5.2 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in normotensive women." In women with high blood pressure, the soy diet also decreased levels of low-density lipoprotein ("bad") cholesterol by an average of 11 percent and levels of apoliprotein B (a particle that carries bad cholesterol) by an average of 8 percent. Cholesterol levels remained the same in women with normal blood pressure. "A 12-millimeter of mercury decrease in systolic blood pressure for 10 years has been estimated to prevent one death for every 11 patients with stage one hypertension treated; therefore, the average reduction of 15 milligrams of mercury in systolic blood pressure in hypertensive women in the present study could have significant implications for reducing cardiovascular risk and death on a population basis," the authors write. "This study was performed in the free-living state; therefore, dietary soy may be a practical, safe and inexpensive modality to reduce blood pressure. If the findings are repeated in a larger group they may have important implications for reducing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women on a population basis," they conclude.

New guidelines issued by the World Health Organization on 30 May have recommended that doctors everywhere, including richer nations, consider routinely offering the test. The aim is to identify carriers before they unwittingly spread the virus or get too ill to benefit from treatment. In some parts of sub-Saharan Africa where HIV is rife, only 12 per cent of men and 10 per cent of women know their HIV status, while research in the US has shown that unwitting carriers account for 50 to 70 per cent of new infections. "I think this is extremely important," says Kevin De Cock, the WHO's HIV/AIDS director. "This is advice for countries and it must be country-led." The guidelines stress that no one should feel forced to take a test, and people can opt out. But by ... The complete article is 352 words long.

' What? This man has put countless people at risk of infection. After being told he should not travel he got on several planes and traveled to several countries putting innocent people including his own family (including his new wife) and friends at risk. Now how much money and time have has to be spent tracking down these people and having them tested? How much inconvenience and fright do these people have to go thru while they wait to see if they've picked up this very serious form of TB? All because one peron couldn't be responsible and change his plans. While it may be unlikely, how will he feel if someone gets sick and dies because of what he did? I think he should be held responsible for his actions. This man needs jail time or fines. May 31st, 2007 - 14:57:44 This kind of blatant disregard for others is a crime. I hope the fellow passengers on his flights that need testing sue him for all he's worth for endangering their lives and the lives of thousands should the infection spread. I hope no one gets this disease from him, but if they do, I hope he does get jail time. This is how the next pandemic will be started, by some guy who wants to travel to his wedding. So incredibly irresponsible. May 31st, 2007 - 15:06:30 Another snobass lawyer thinking his shit didn't stink and that he was above the law. If even 1 person becomes ill with this he should get 20 to life for attemped murder. If you knowingly give someone aids you can be charged--he should be also lets get another side of the story May 31st, 2007 - 15:07:54 Hey, all we have here is just one side of the story, edited by one person, with some comments lifted out from another CDC person. What about getting the man's side of the story before he is lynched in the court of public opinion. May 31st, 2007 - 15:08:50 This as some will remember was how aids originally spread --a attendant on a international flight spread it from country to country May 31st, 2007 - 16:15:46 This lawyer Atlanta is a danger to evry one.He gives lawyers the bad names like scum. He was told dont get on a plane-so whats the idiot do he flies to Rome.They catch him there and he boards planes for small trips, AFTER he was told hes highly infected.He should spend some time in jail.

But if you've also heard the story of Marge and her Daughters -- which sounds like an animated movie and could be if Disney or Pixar get their hands on it -- you know that that epithet's days are numbered. That's because Marge, a Friesen cow discovered in New Zealand, isn't exactly your normal bovine. Sure, she produces milk just like most cows, but the milk she produces is decidedly different. You see, while about 3.5 per cent of most cows' milk is saturated fat, health conscious Marge's milk contains only about one per cent. This means that Marge can give you skim milk right from the udder. It also means that butter made from Marge's milk is so soft it spreads like margarine. Email to a friend Better yet, her milk is also high in omega-3 oils, which are believed to improve brain power. A New Zealand dairy company discovered Marge after testing millions of cattle. So the company purchased Marge and now has its research scientists working on finding the gene that allows cows to produce low-fat milk. Though they have yet to discover the gene, scientists have found that about half of Marge's daughters also possess it, and hence they too can produce healthier milk. But according to Russell Snell, the chief scientist with the biotech firm ViaLactia, if one of Marge's son's also possessed the gene, it would constitute the "holy grail," since a "low-fat" bull would allow breeders to reproduce hundreds of thousands of cattle like Marge. One might wonder what the big deal is since milk manufacturers already produce low-fat by skimming off its fat. But many consumers find milk loses its taste when fat is skimmed, so Marge represents an opportunity to provide full-tasting milk with only a fraction of the fat. All of which means that Marge and her low-fat progeny could help to rehabilitate the reputation of milk. And they could also give the reputation of cows a much-needed shot in the leg.

He apparently also shortened his honeymoon &#8212; which included stays in Greece and Italy &#8212; and returned home early to avoid the complicated procedure being put together to get him back to the United States in a way that would not expose others to his dangerous microbe. The man, back in Georgia and undergoing treatment, provided a different version of events to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, saying he was never explicitly told he could not travel. The man and his fianc&#233;e traveled from Paris to Athens, where the two married, and to two Greek islands. "We headed off to Greece thinking everything's fine," the man told the Atlanta paper. He declined interview requests Wednesday. Because of privacy issues, he has not been identified; he is said to be in his 30s. Wednesday, officials from the Fulton County Health and Wellness Department and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they emphatically told him to stay put. "He was told in no uncertain terms that he had a serious, contagious disease," said Dr. Steven Katkowsky, director of the Fulton County health department. "We told him not to travel." Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's division of global migration and quarantine, said the agency is making slow progress in reaching passengers and crew aboard the man's trans-Atlantic flights. Authorities in the United States and several European countries are tracking down about 50 people who sat near the man on his Atlanta-to-Paris flight May 12, and 30 people on his Prague-to-Montreal return last Thursday. They will be offered testing to see if they are infected. CDC officials are concentrating on the trans-Atlantic flights, when the likelihood of disease spread was greatest because the man was in a confined space with others for hours. Authorities also disclosed that the man was on several flights between various European locales during the time he was abroad. Passenger lists for those flights also were being tracked down, officials said. Cetron stressed that the chances that other people were infected is low. But because the man's disease, extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR-TB, is so difficult to treat, the agency could take no chances. The CDC is isolating the man under a federal public-health order, the first issued since the isolation of a smallpox patient in 1963. It remained unclear how the man contracted TB, and his wife tested negative for the illness, the CDC said. The man's illness was discovered after he fell, hurt his ribs and got an X-ray, which revealed an abnormality in his right lung, suggesting TB. In March, lab tests revealed he had TB. By May 10, further tests showed it was "multidrug-resistant" version: It could not be killed by the two most commonly used drugs. That same day, Eric Benning, of the Fulton County health department, met with the patient and his personal physician. Benning said he told the man "it was our recommendation that he not travel because of the potential exposure of other people but also for his benefit." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution quoted the man as saying local health officials told him they "preferred" he not travel. When more tests revealed the man had the extensively drug-resistant TB, the CDC reached the man in Rome by cellphone, told him not to travel and said arrangements for travel and treatment were being made, Cetron said. The man told the Atlanta paper he interpreted that conversation as meaning he was stuck in Italy and decided to sneak home because he feared he would die without treatment in the United States. "I thought to myself: 'You're nuts.' I wasn't going to do that," he said. Although his plans were to return June 5, he and his wife returned to the United States on Thursday. CDC officials reached the man on his cellphone Friday near Albany, N.Y. He drove himself to a hospital in New York and was taken in a CDC plane back to Atlanta on Monday. He is isolated at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta and is in stable condition, the CDC said. Cetron said the man wants to be taken to the National Jewish Medical and Research Center in Denver, one of the few U.S. institutions where TB has been a research focus for decades.

Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the Skin NATIONAL (NBC) - Most of us know the best way to protect yourself against skin cancer is to cover up and wear sunscreen. But you may be able to drink your way to safer skin. To protect yourself from sun damage and skin cancer, dermatologist Doctor Bryan Chen says there&#39;s steps you should take. "The use of sunscreens to cover up the best that you can from the sun, the use of hats during the day, and try to avoid the sun during the hours of 10 in the morning to two in the afternoon when the sun intensity is the greatest outdoors - that in combination with drinking tea - I think would be useful." Drinking just one cup of tea a day will lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer - squamous and basal cell carcinoma. That&#39;s according to a report from the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. Dr. Chen says, "Teas have long been known to contain antioxidants in them - and also chemicals called polyphenals." In the first human study of more than 2,000 people - tea&#39;s antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun&#39;s ultraviolet rays. But, Doctor Chen says, tea isn&#39;t the cure-all for skin cancer. "Just because you drink tea doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a 100% protection against the development of skin cancer. You really do need to do it in combination with other protective measures protect yourself from the sun." Scientists found the more tea you drink each day and over the years, the better the skin protection. It doesn&#39;t matter if the tea is hot or cold. And all types of tea offered protection, including green, black and herbal tea. All content &copy; Copyright 2000 - 2007 WorldNow and WISTV, a All Rights Reserved.

EU sports White Paper to address 'inclusion' Support for free fruit and vegetable distribution Obese children influenced by TV adverts, study... 'Doctors need better training to help obese... Consumer needs drive innovation in food sector According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the prevalence of obesity has more than trebled in many European countries since the 1980s. People consume more calories per day, in particular from fat, whereas their physical activity levels have gone down.  Child obesity is of particular concern as obese young tend to become obese adults, with all the health risks this condition represents: heart disease, type-2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and certain types of cancer. According to the Commission, some three million European schoolchildren are obese and some 85,000 more children become obese each year.  Obesity related illnesses are estimated to account for as much as 7% of total healthcare costs in the EU.  EU platform for action on diet, physical activity and health brings, since March 2005, together industry, consumer groups and health experts to find ways to combat obesity. Its emphasis is on self-regulation and voluntary commitments from the stakeholders. on 'Promoting healthy diets and physical activity: a European dimension for the prevention of overweight, obesity and chronic diseases' was adopted in December 2005. "Our biggest achievement so far is that we have managed to raise knowledge on obesity and to get everybody to recognise that there is a problem," said Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou presenting the  on 'A Strategy for Europe on Nutrition, Overweight and Obesity related health issues', adopted by the Commission on 30 May 2007.  "What consumers eat is up to them, but they should be able to make informed choices, and have a range of healthy options to choose from. That is why the Commission is reviewing the options for nutrition labelling, and calling on industry to advertise responsibly and reduce levels of salt, fats and sugar in food products," he added.  However, "given the urgency of the matter, it is better to try with self-regulation at first and see, in 2010, if there's a need for legislation," said Kyprianou arguing that "offering industry these two and half years", after which member states could decide to legislate, represented a "great incentive for industry to co-operate on the obesity problem". Building on the EU obesity platform and the Green Paper on promoting healthy diets and physical activity, the White Paper calls for more cross-sectoral action-orientated partnerships across the EU. These would involve private actors and public health and consumer organisations.  The Commission is also urging the private sector to develop stronger advertising codes, the food and retailing industry to make greater efforts to reformulate foods and sport organisations to develop advertising and marketing campaigns to encourage physical activity focusing in particular on children. With regard the obesity platform launched in March 2005, Kyprianou said that it "is starting to produce results even though we have not reached target yet." Therefore, this platform will continue discussions. A High-Level Group on nutrition, overweight and obesity related health issues will be established to liaise the platform at member state level to ensure exchange of best practices.  As to physical activity, Commissioner Kyprianou recognised that the issue is more in the hands of member states and that the challenge is not the same in all EU-27. "Children do not entertain themselves through physical activity anymore. Therefore, schools should re-introduce physical activity as entertainment to their curricula instead of pure physical performance exercise," he said. The Confederation of the food and drink industries of the EU ( ) and the Association of the chocolate, biscuit and confectionery industries ( ) have welcomed the Commission's strategy.  The association of television and radio sales houses ( ) also welcomed the strategy and the fact that "the Commission recognises the added value of and supports advertising self-regulation".  the individual is ultimately responsible for his lifestyle and that advertising and marketing are only  that shape an environment in which consumers take individual decisions, the European Commission is moving away from simplistic and ineffective additional restrictions to advertising of food products," states egta.  , "the commerce sector is pleased to see that the White Paper acknowledges the effectiveness of multi-stakeholder approaches to fight against obesity. Voluntary initiatives are recognised as important tools to promote healthy lifestyles. EuroCommerce welcomes the fact that the Commission will give these time to produce result before proposing any new legislation." "EuroCommerce members are confident that voluntary initiatives are more effective and tailor-made to help the consumer understand the benefit of both good diet and healthy lifestyle."  The European Consumers' Organisation ( ) qualifies the strategy as "a disappointing, unambitious and minimalist response to the problems of obesity and diet related diseases that the White Paper itself identifies. On advertising of food for children the White Paper talks vaguely about partnerships and voluntary measures, with a review in 2010  when there will be a new Commission."  "Reading the White Paper it seems that Mr Kyprianou and the Barroso Commission have already decided to leave much of the work to their successors  who will no doubt themselves wish to 'review the situation' before deciding what to do," deplored BEUC Director Jim Murray urging the current Commission to do "much more before they go" and to at least to bring forward a "robust proposal for simplified nutritional labelling". Latest & next steps: The Commission will monitor the progress and performance of all actors in the next three years and conduct a first review in 2010. The EU-27 health ministers held a public debate on health promotion by means of nutrition and physical activity and adopted Council conclusions on the issue on 31 May 2007. Commissioner Kypirianou is set to establish the High-Level Group on nutrition, overweight and obesity related health issues "right after the summer break" in autumn 2007.

Complete Moisture Plus was pulled from sale in the US six days ago following a warning from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. US government officials linked the solution to acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a painful eye infection. Advanced Medical Optics (AMO) which makes the solution, has issued the recall as a "precautionary measure". AMO said in a statement: "The recall is being initiated because of concerns over eye infections from acanthamoeba, a naturally occurring water-borne organism which can contribute to serious corneal infections." The recall is not related to contamination and no other AMO products are affected, the firm added. The company is asking contact lens wearers who begin suffering eye pain, redness, blurred vision or sensitivity to light to seek medical attention. There are reports of 138 cases of eye infections in the US which are being investigated. But AMO said it had not received any reports of UK users suffering eye problems. Those who swim or shower while wearing contact lenses, use tap water to clean their lenses or come into contact with contaminated water are most are most prone to getting AK, the company said. The eye infection can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness in rare cases.

The 32-year-old American, who is under the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963, flew from Atlanta to Paris in early May to celebrate his wedding and honeymoon in Europe and returned from Prague by way of Montreal, each time taking regular trans-Atlantic flights. The decision was taken at the recommendation of the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) and concerns people who were in close proximity to the American, who has a highly drug-resistant form of tuberculosis (XDR-TB), on board the flights. "As a precautionary measure and following recommendations from the World Health Organization (WHO), the ECDC's advice is to perform contact tracing for passengers 2 rows ahead, 2 rows behind and the row of the infected passenger, and the cabin crew concerned," the ECDC said in a statement. "The ECDC's advice is that the risk for these persons is very limited, other passengers are not considered at risk."

Urges HIV Testing for All Patients in Hard-Hit Nations Washington Post Foreign Service Thursday, May 31, 2007; Page A15 JOHANNESBURG, May 30 -- health officials on Wednesday called on nations with severe AIDS epidemics to offer routine, confidential HIV tests to all patients at health-care facilities in hopes of dramatically expanding the number of those who know they have the virus. Patients would retain the right to refuse the test, but the new guidelines mark a significant departure from the common practice of relying on patients to seek tests for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. U.N. officials estimate that nearly 80 percent of the people with HIV in poor and developing countries do not know they have it. In alone, they said, nearly 20 million people with HIV are not aware they have the virus.

Save & Share Article The new guidelines will not immediately alleviate the problem. Individual nations must first decide whether to adopt them and allocate money to expand testing. That is likely to prove difficult in , where a severe shortage of doctors and nurses already is straining health systems, medical experts said. The new guidelines also call for mandatory counseling to accompany the HIV testing. No new U.N. funding has been set aside for the initiative. "I see difficulty in following those guidelines in our circumstances," said Derek von Wissell, head of 's national AIDS council, speaking from the capital, Mbabane. "It's going to take an hour per patient. And I don't think we have that kind of resource available to us." The guidelines also call for physicians anywhere in the world to offer testing to patients who exhibit symptoms of AIDS. But in the several dozen nations where infection rates exceed 1 percent, everyone seeking medical care should be offered an HIV test, regardless of their symptoms or the reason for seeking care, the U.N. officials said. already have similar policies. The officials said they were seeking to formulate guidelines that would expand testing while respecting individual rights. Other approaches to testing, including at stand-alone facilities, also would be encouraged. "People need to know their HIV status, and there are many different ways to achieve that," Kevin De Cock, director of the HIV/AIDS department for the , said in a conference call with journalists. The heavy stigma that long has accompanied AIDS has made testing a sensitive issue, especially in Africa, where there have been well-publicized cases of violence against people who have tested positive. But the lack of adequate testing has hampered efforts to provide the sophisticated antiretroviral treatment that increasingly is available even in the poorest nations. Many people discover they have HIV only when they become gravely ill, making it more difficult, and far more costly, to effectively treat them. Zackie Achmat of the Treatment Action Campaign, an activist group in , told reporters on the conference call that the new guidelines respected the rights of those with HIV while also improving their chances of accessing medical services. "These guidelines are long, long overdue," Achmat said. The U.N. officials said expanded testing may also improve efforts to prevent new infections, but the research on that is unclear. There is scant evidence that people who test negative for HIV change their sexual behavior. And there is no proven correlation between high rates of HIV testing in nations and falling rates of new infections. also questioned whether the move toward more extensive testing would lead to the trampling of individual rights. The new U.N. guidelines say that spoken consent, rather than written, is sufficient for HIV testing. "The concern I have is that not enough is being done to monitor HIV testing programs to make sure that consent is granted and testing is confidential and counseling is offered," Joseph Amon, head of the group's AIDS program, said from New York.

Sinai: 'Third Wave' Of 9/11 Illnesses Appear Slideshow: The World Trade Center Remembered WCBSTV.com's 9/11 Special Report There are new cancer concerns at Ground Zero. Doctors fear a third wave of illness is starting to show up among first responders who worked in the rubble of the Twin Towers. For many years, scientists reported that it was too soon to link cancers to the toxins that workers were exposed to at Ground Zero after 9/11. But new research could start linking exposure to blood cancers. More than 20,000 responders to the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks have been examined by doctors at Mount Sinai's World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program, and those doctors are now worried about some of those responders could soon be facing a devastating "third wave" of illnesses. The concern is that those who worked at Ground Zero will be diagnosed with blood and lymphatic cancers because of their exposure to the air at "The Pit." The first wave of illnesses was considered to be that stubborn, dry "World Trade Center cough," which was first noticed in the months following the attacks. The cough was likely caused by workers inhaling pulverized cement in the air while working downtown. The second wave largely involves chronic respiratory diseases that cause lung inflammation and scarring. The third wave is now expected to include cancers among responders who were exposed to asbestos, dioxins and other carcinogens at Ground Zero. This new information was released in Thursday's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine, where Dr. Robin Herbert, the co-director of Mount Sinai's World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program, described the latest findings in an online audio interview. "We know we have a handful of cases of multiple myeloma in very young individuals. And multiple myelomas usually present later in life. And that's the odd, unusual and troubling finding we're seeing already," Herbert said. Ironically, the latest findings could be welcome news for some Ground Zero workers. These newly released findings could help the case for a lawyer representing more than 100 workers, who claim they got cancer by working at Ground Zero.

Zimbabwe will put 40,000 more people on life saving anti-retroviral drugs by the end of the year despite an economic crisis that has hobbled the country's health care, state media reported on Tuesday. REUTERS/Howard Burditt HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe will put 40,000 more people on life saving anti-retroviral drugs by the end of the year despite an economic crisis that has hobbled the country's health care, state media reported on Tuesday. The southern African country is among the worst hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, killing more than 3,000 people every week and accounting for 70 percent of hospital admissions. But Zimbabwe, in the grips of a deep recession, has also become one of the few AIDS bright spots on the continent after its HIV prevalence rate declined to 18.1 percent last year from 25 percent six years ago. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said the number of people receiving the life-prolonging medicines has increased from 60,000 in December to 80,000 this month but that the government would add another 40,000 patients by the end of the year. ADVERTISEMENT (article continues below) "Currently the number of people on ARVs has grown to 80,000 since December last year and we hope to achieve our target of getting 120,000 by the end of the year," Parirenyatwa told the official Herald newspaper. Parirenyatwa said that at least 300,000 people living with HIV/AIDS were in urgent need of ARVs. Zimbabwe's drive to increase access to ARVs has been hampered by a severe shortage of foreign currency, itself a sign of an economic crisis that has pushed inflation past 3,700 percent and increased poverty levels. The crisis has been particularly felt in the health sector, where basic drugs are in short supply while strikes for better pay by doctors and nurses have worsened the situation. President Robert Mugabe -- who says Zimbabwe is showing the way for Africa in the fight against HIV/AIDS -- rejects charges of mismanagement and blames the West for sabotaging the economy as punishment for seizing white-owned farms to distribute to blacks.

"What we're trying to handle right now ... is what the CDC hit us with," said James Mazzo, president and chief executive officer of Santa Ana, Calif.-based Advanced Medical Optics Inc., in a Tuesday morning conference call. Government officials Friday warned people to throw away AMO Complete Moisture Plus Multi-Purpose Solution, using for cleaning and storing soft contact lenses, after an investigation linked it to a rare eye infection. The solution seems to be a factor in cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis, a painful eye infection caused by a waterborne organism that, untreated, can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. "It's not a manufacturing problem or a contamination issue," said Mazzo, who added that the infection, also called "AK," affects people who improperly handle contact lenses, such as disinfecting them with water or wearing them while swimming or showering. "AK is something the vast majority of contact lens users typically avoid by following their eye practitioner's advice," Mazzo said. "All of our products ... have always met and continue to meet FDA requirements. Moisture Plus does what it is required to do." CDC officials said they drew a link between the Advanced Medical Optics product and the infection because 58 percent of confirmed cases who wore soft contact lenses had used the solution in the month before onset of symptoms, and 39 percent had used only that solution. They calculated that wearers of soft contact lenses who had the infection were at least seven times more likely to have used AMO Complete Moisture Plus than healthy people who wear soft contact lenses. It's generally difficult to draw a strong statistical conclusion from a small number of cases, but in this case an association between the product and the infection was clear-cut, CDC officials said. Health officials will continue to investigate why the association exists. But in the interest of public health, they decided a warning was necessary, said Dr. Sharon Roy, the CDC epidemiologist who led the investigation. Chief Financial Officer Randy Meier said that the Moisture Plus products' $105.7 million in 2006 sales represent about 10 percent of the company's total consolidated sales. "We're still working through the details to determine how much of that revenue will be impacted by the recall," Meier said. "It is impossible to assess what path we'll take or what the impact will be to our future earnings." Meier said the company will update investors early next week. "While this recall is clearly a setback for our eye care business, none of our other products will be affected," Meier said. Shares of Advanced Medical Optics fell 13.7 percent to $34.69 Tuesday. The CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are investigating 138 confirmed cases since January 2005. CDC officials said people should discard the solution, throw out their current contact lenses and toss away the lens storage case. All of them may harbor the infecting amoeba, said Michael Beach, team leader in the CDC's division of parasitic diseases. An estimated 85 percent of U.S. cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis occur in contact lens users, but it's extremely rare. The estimated prevalence is one to two cases per 1 million contact lens wearers. Contact lens wearers who practice proper lens care and people who don't wear contact lenses can still develop the infection.

U.S. health officials Tuesday urged hundreds of travelers aboard two Air France and Czech Air flights be tested for a drug-resistant tuberculosis carried by a passenger now quarantined in Atlanta. (File Photo) BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhuanet) -- The U.S. health authorities begin a worldwide search for passengers on two trans-Atlantic flights who may have come into contact with a man infected with a potentially deadly form of tuberculosis, media reported Wednesday. The U.S. government Centers for Disease Control (DCD) in Atlanta, Georgia, are seeking around 80 passengers and a further 27 crew members in two flights taken by the infected man, said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's division of global migration and quarantine. Two flights involved Air France AF385 from Atlanta to Paris on May 12 and Czech Air 0104 from Prague to Montreal on May 24. Other passengers on the flights are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in them was "quite low," Cetron said. The man, who is under the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963, was infected with a rare case of extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR TB. He told a newspaper he flew from Atlanta to Greece for a wedding and then traveled to Italy for a honeymoon. Later he flew back to North America for treatment. He also took several other flights in Greece and Italy, but the health agency stressed that those on these shorter flights did not face a significant risk. The man is being held in isolation and under armed guard at a U.S. hospital in the southern state of Georgia. Health officials said the man had been advised not to fly and knew he could expose others when he boarded the jets. But the man said doctors did not order him not to fly.

Back problems are a difficult challenge for doctors in part because it is difficult to know when to operate. Consider sciatica, where a leg becomes numb or pain shoots down a leg because a nerve is pinched. In 75 percent of patients, the problem improves without surgery within three months. Nonetheless, 1.5 million disk operations are done worldwide each year. Typically, doctors remove part of the disk to take the pressure off the nerve. One new study, led by Wilco Peul of the Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, looked at 283 patients who had suffered with the problem for at least six weeks. They found that 95 percent reported recovery after one year, whether or not they had surgery. However, 39 percent assigned to conservative care opted for surgery anyway, typically after about five months, and surgery relieved the symptoms twice as quickly. "Thus, for patients with persistent sciatica, there seems to be a reasonable choice between surgical and nonsurgical treatment, which may be influenced by aversion to surgical risks, the severity of symptoms, and willingness to wait for spontaneous healing," Richard Deyo of the University of Washington in Seattle said in a Journal editorial. The second study looked at a very different problem where degeneration in the spine bones causes one to slip too far forward. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

In making the recommendations, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS are underlining the need to identify the millions worldwide who need treatment. WHO estimates that approximately 80 percent of HIV-positive people in developing countries are currently unaware of their status. "If we are serious about ensuring universal access to drugs, there has to be a fundamental change in the approach to HIV testing," said Dr. Kevin De Cock, director of WHO's AIDS department. The UN now advises health workers to test patients for HIV as part of standard medical care, but only with the patient's informed consent. Yet there are questions about how the cash-strapped countries in Africa might adopt these guidelines. Of the estimated 40 million people living worldwide with HIV/AIDS, nearly 65 percent are in Africa. Because current estimates of the number of HIV/AIDS patients include people who don't know their status, experts do not expect the numbers to rise dramatically if more people are tested. Though universal testing will certainly identify more HIV-positive people needing lifesaving anti-retrovirals, there is already a long waiting list: Nearly 5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are still without treatment. Identifying more AIDS patients whom countries cannot afford to treat threatens to create an even bigger backlog of people who know they are sick, but have no access to care. Most AIDS experts believe that increased HIV testing will help, even if the conditions are not perfect. "No one wants a situation where people find out they're HIV-positive and can't get anti-retroviral treatment," said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of HIV policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation. "But if we waited until everything was perfectly aligned, we would never respond." Another benefit of testing: Past studies also have shown that once people are aware that they are HIV-positive, they tend to practice safer sex - which could give prevention efforts a boost. Africa's weak health infrastructure, though, is a huge stumbling block. The continent urgently needs at least another 4 million health workers to fill the gap, according to WHO. Without doctors and nurses to administer the HIV tests or to provide the necessary treatment when patients are identified, such guidance will create even more stress for Africa's already fragile health systems. Still, the new testing procedures should mean that HIV patients are found earlier. "The biggest problem we have now is that our health care systems are overburdened with very sick people who come in too late," said Zackie Achmat, chairman of South Africa's Treatment Action Campaign. "These new guidelines are long overdue," said Achmat. "We cannot deal with the burden on the health care service if we don't prevent people from becoming so sick that they become a supreme burden on it," he said. Increased HIV testing and the treatment and infrastructure it ultimately entails will require more money, yet no new funds have been announced to help countries implement these policies. The UN estimates that the fight against AIDS in 2007-2008 requires $22 billion, and there is still a considerable shortfall. Last year, the deficit for global AIDS programs was about $6 billion. While health authorities would like to see the new UN recommendations adopted as soon as possible, much will depend on whether countries decide to follow their advice. "I hope that countries start implementing this immediately," said WHO's De Cock. "But we know you can't just flip the switch and change everything in one day."

It is widely accepted that AIDS results from infection with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). Boehringer Ingelheim initiates international head-to-head HIV/AIDS trial Buy best HIV products from Amazon HIV :: Boehringer Ingelheim initiates international head-to-head HIV/AIDS trial Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH announced that it has initiated and begun enrollment of patients in the ArTEN trial, which will compare the efficacy and safety of Viramune® (nevirapine), a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI), dosed once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID), versus atazanavir/ritonavir, a once-daily dosed protease inhibitor (PI). Both agents will be combined with a background regimen including tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada®). The ArTEN trial will enroll 561 HIV-positive patients who have not been treated with antiretrovirals before. ArTEN is an important trial. Viramune® dosed twice daily is proven to be an effective, tolerable and durable treatment option with a favourable lipid profile. In ArTEN, Viramune® will be compared with an atazanavir-based regimen. ArTEN may help to provide more information on selecting treatment options for first-line therapy in HIV-positive patients, said Vicente Soriano, M.D., assistant professor, University Complutense and chief, infectious diseases, Hospital Carlos III, Madrid, Spain. The ArTEN (Atazanavir/ritonavir on a background of Tenofovir and Emtricitabine (Truvada®) versus Nevirapine) trial is a Phase IIIb, open-label, multinational, randomised, three-arm trial. The primary endpoint is virologic response after 48 weeks of treatment. Treatment response is defined as a viral load of less than 50 copies/mL measured at two consecutive visits prior to week 48 and without subsequent rebound or change of antiretroviral therapy prior to week 48. Patients will be randomised to receive 200 mg of Viramune® BID, 400 mg of Viramune® QD or 300 mg of atazanavir, boosted with 100 mg of ritonavir, with a backbone regimen of tenofovir and emtricitabine (Truvada®). Patients in the Viramune® arm will begin their treatment with 200 mg QD, increased to either 200 mg BID or 400 mg QD after two weeks. Patients will be observed for a period of 48 weeks, with an extension period of up to 144 weeks. Viramune® has proven to be a good treatment choice for HIV-positive patients during more than one million patient years of experience and extensive clinical trials, said Dr. Andreas Barner, Vice-Chairman, Board of Managing Directors and Head of Corporate Board Division Pharma Research, Development and Medicine, Boehringer Ingelheim. The new ArTEN trial aims to help patients and physicians better understand the role of Viramune® within todays evolving treatment strategies. We expect ArTEN trial results will be available in 2009. (Last updated on Thursday, May 31, 2007, and first posted on Monday, May 14, 2007) Send to a Friend Recently posted related articles on HIV : HIV :: New HIV recommendations aim for wider knowledge of HIV status HIV :: WHO, UNAIDS' new guidance on HIV testing & counselling in health facilities HIV :: New study suggests potential for a broadly-protective HIV vaccine HIV :: New AIDS Tech Transfers reinforce Roche commitment to strengthen African manufacturing HIV :: Health workers & doctors shortage limits AIDS care in South Africa HIV :: AHF counters GSK ads that promote fear of HIV treatment Hepatitis C :: Hepatitis C negatively impacts HIV HIV :: Indian Court dismisses petition seeking compulsory HIV test for couples HIV :: Alarming rise in HIV/AIDS cases in Bihar HIV :: Bush's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief is proving effective Encyclopedia details on HIV best books on HIV .

The southern African country is among the worst hit by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, killing more than 3,000 people every week and accounting for 70 percent of hospital admissions. But Zimbabwe, in the grips of a deep recession, has also become one of the few AIDS bright spots on the continent after its HIV prevalence rate declined to 18.1 percent last year from 25 percent six years ago. Health Minister David Parirenyatwa said the number of people receiving the life-prolonging medicines has increased from 60,000 in December to 80,000 this month but that the government would add another 40,000 patients by the end of the year. "Currently the number of people on ARVs has grown to 80,000 since December last year and we hope to achieve our target of getting 120,000 by the end of the year," Parirenyatwa told the official Herald newspaper. Parirenyatwa said that at least 300,000 people living with HIV/AIDS were in urgent need of ARVs. Zimbabwe's drive to increase access to ARVs has been hampered by a severe shortage of foreign currency, itself a sign of an economic crisis that has pushed inflation past 3,700 percent and increased poverty levels. The crisis has been particularly felt in the health sector, where basic drugs are in short supply while strikes for better pay by doctors and nurses have worsened the situation. President Robert Mugabe -- who says Zimbabwe is showing the way for Africa in the fight against HIV/AIDS -- rejects charges of mismanagement and blames the West for sabotaging the economy as punishment for seizing white-owned farms to distribute to blacks. news is provided by Zoom to full size map ZIMBABWE: Pro-government militias launch intimidation campaign against Catholics EU to give AIDS/TB/malaria fund 400 million euros Blair urges G8 to keep African promises Zimbabwe dehorns rhino to deter poachers - paper FACTBOX-Facts on African dictators' legal cases Catholic Relief Services commends President's call to double PEPFAR funding Source: CRS - USA World Vision Lauds Bush Global AIDS Funding Proposal Source: WV - USA HIV and AIDS: Turning Remembrance Into Action on Candlelight Memorial Day Source: WV MEERO - Cyprus Put food at the heart of the fight against HIV and Aids or fail, warn leading aid agencies Source: CARE International - UK HELP WANTED: Health worker shortage limits access to HIV/AIDS treatment in southern Africa Members of a Libyan court, including judge Salem Hamrouni (C), speak after announcing a verdict in the defamation trial of five Bulgarian nurses in Tripli May 27, 2007.

The infant died of bacteremia, also known as blood poisoning, after contracting the pathogen serratia. Hospital officials did not release the gender of the baby, citing patient confidentiality, but said the baby was premature, and weighed between oneÂ and three pounds. Four other babies have tested positive for serratia, a naturally occurring bacteria that can cause severe infection in vulnerable premature babies. "We don't even know if they have the same strands yet. It's just that because this bacteria can cause such serious infections â¦ we're being careful," said Dr. Alison McGeer, a microbiologist with the hospital. "With this bacteria you don't take chances." She said, however, thatÂ it's unlikely the unit would have closed if the hospital wasn'tÂ struggling with overcrowding. "The reason it's closed is mostly because we're caring for more babies than we should be anyway," said McGeer, adding that they would have instead isolated the babies. Experts recommend 10 feet (3.05 metres) between incubators, but the decades-old Toronto hospital was built with only four to five feet (1.22 to 1.52 metres). Babies have been isolated and hospital have ramped up infection-control procedures, such as wearing gloves and gowns. Parents and visitorsÂ were still being allowed into the unit Thursday, but no new patients were being accepted.

A Friesian (or Holstein-Friesian) cow is a breed of Holstein diary cow, only smaller and heavier. The website of ViaLactia is: In addition, Marge produces milk that is lower in saturated fat, so that butter produced isn&rsquo;t hard but spreadable. Such milk should also be high in the good fats of monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturates. It is also high in omega-3 oils, which is touted as being good for the heart and brain. In five years of breeding, Marge has produced female calves that also make low-fat milk. The scientists are now trying to produce a sire (male calf) that contains the low-fat milk producing gene. Scientists with the 109-million-dollar (U.S.) research project are hoping to produce a commercial herd of low-fat milk producing cows by the year 2011. Currently, the New Zealand milk company called Fonterra already is using Marge&rsquo;s and her offspring&#39;s milk for its customers. Milk experts claim that such cows could &ldquo;revolutionize&rdquo; the milking industry.

Currently 80% of people infected with HIV in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa do not know they have it. However, no test should be done against a person's wishes or without their knowledge, the guidelines stress. Forcing them to carry out HIV tests insults their intelligence in such a way that they are no different from animals Omara Daniel Allan, Kampala Send us your comments Dr Kevin De Cock, director of WHO HIV/Aids said too many opportunities to diagnose the infection were being missed. Industrialised countries also need to take note of the guidance which recommends offering a test to everyone who presents with symptoms suggestive of HIV and people in high-risk groups, such as those attending sexual health clinics. Recent surveys in sub-Saharan Africa showed on average just 12% of men and 10% of women have been tested for HIV and received their test results. Until now, testing was only done if a person requested it. But in countries with HIV epidemic that affects the whole population, all patients attending all health facilities should now be offered testing, whether or not the patient has symptoms of HIV disease and regardless of the patient's reason for attending the health centre. The HIV test would be carried out unless the patient declines. Tests in low income countries cost up to $2 US dollars. People must be fully informed before testing and receive counselling afterwards, the guidance states. And patients should receive support to avoid potential negative consequences of knowing and disclosing their HIV status, such as discrimination or violence. Access to antiretroviral therapy is not a pre-requisite to testing but countries must have a treatment plan in place, which includes an intention to introduce the drugs when possible. "Globally the number of people living with HIV who are aware of their infection status is quite low - 20% in low and middle income countries" said Dr De Cock. "Even in the industrialised world the situation is far from satisfactory." "This is a significant shift but it builds on current recommendations and this document was based on lengthy consultation." Dr Paul De Lay, director of monitoring and evaluation at UNAids said it had been estimated that 200 million people worldwide could be offered tests which meant they had access to prevention advice and treatment if the were infected. "If we are going to get ahead of this epidemic, rapidly scaled up HIV treatment and prevention efforts are critical - and increased uptake of HIV testing will be fundamental to making this a reality," he said. "At the same time, and in all cases of HIV testing and counselling, the three Cs - that is consent, confidentiality and counselling - must be respected." Routinely offered HIV testing and counselling has already been implemented in a range of clinical settings in several countries, including Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia. Some countries, such as Canada, Thailand, UK and the US offer tests in high-risk settings. Lisa Power, of the UK HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "We fully support these recommendations. "In the UK, this means that sexual health clinics and health services for those at particular risk of HIV should be recommending HIV testing - something which we've been advocating for some time. "A third of people with HIV don't know they have it and many of them may never have considered testing. We need this proactive approach to help these people as early as possible." Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, said: "Healthcare workers, particularly in primary care, also need training so that they can identify symptoms of HIV as early as possible."

Sedentary mice fed epicatechin -- a natural flavanol found in blueberries, tea, grapes, and cocoa (read: dark chocolate) -- greater memory skills than those who were deprived; exercise boosted performance in both groups. Epicatechin was shown to increase blood-vessel growth in the dentate gyrus -- an area of the brain that undergoes neurogenesis -- and mature neuron development. The addition of exercise further showed increased expression of genes important for learning and memory, and a decrease in genes associated with inflammation and neural degeneration. Unfortunately, there's a potential conflict of interest. This research -- published in the and performed by Henriette van Praag from the Salk Institute -- was supported by DARPA, with the epicatechin provided by . Mars markets "epicatechin-rich" lines of chocolate, including dark chocolate versions of Dove and M&Ms. Will it stop me from enjoying dark chocolate? Not a chance. A 2004 study out of the University of California, San Francisco -- also funded by Mars, Inc. -- found that eating a 1.6-ounce Dove Dark Chocolate bar a day blood flow and blood vessel dilation in humans. Study author Mary Engler said "dark chocolate contains more flavonoids than any other food -- including green tea, black tea, red wine, and blueberries." Natural Compound and Exercise Boost Memory in Mice While epicatechin-fed mice showed an increase in blood-vessels in the dentate gyrus, mice on diets without epicatechin showed greater new cell survival. To compensate, epicatechin upregulated genes associated with neuronal extension, synaptic plasticity, and increased neuronal spine density (which is associated with improved learning and memory).

Sleep May Be Prime Time For The Brain To Consolidate Memories WHAT DO YOU THINK? It may be possible to boost memory with a plant compound called epicatechin, which is found in foods and drinks including blueberries, grapes, tea, and cocoa. That's according to a study published in The Journal of Neuroscience The researchers included Fred Gage, PhD, of the genetics lab at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif. In a series of lab tests, Gage's team studied epicatechin, which is a type of antioxidant called a flavonol, in female mice. Some of the mice drank or ate water or chow laced with epicatechin and ran on a running wheel for two hours daily. Other mice ran on a running wheel but didn't get epicatechin. Another group of mice had no running wheel and got no epicatechin in their food or water. After six weeks, the researchers tried to train the mice to navigate a watery maze. The mice were supposed to find a hidden platform in the maze within 40 seconds. The mice that consumed epicatechin did better at memorizing the maze than the mice that got no epicatechin. The mice that consumed epicatechin and also ran on their running wheels had the best results of all. The findings suggest that epicatechin may help spatial memory, especially when coupled with exercise, note Gage and colleagues. Exactly how epicatechin does that isn't clear. But the researchers found signs of blood vessel growth in the brains of the mice that consumed epicatechin. Better blood flow to memory-related brain areas may have helped the mice remember the maze. One of the researchers works for Mars Inc., which makes cocoa products and supplied the study's epicatechin. The study was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Products Agency.

Dr. Parirenyatwa, speaking at a Harare workshop on universal access to ARV drug treatment, said the government and its partners had been steadily increasing the number of people getting treatment, but that more needed to be done, the state-controlled Herald newspaper reported on Wednesday. The minister said the total number currently receiving ARV drug therapy had risen to some 80,000 compared with about 50,000 last December. An estimated 300,000 need the drugs, Dr. Parirenyatwa said, though some HIV/AIDS activists place the number closer to a half million people. Director Tendayi Kureya of the Development Data Trust, who was present at the workshop, told reporter Ndimyake Mwakalyelye of VOA's Studio 7 for Zimbabwe that he believes the figure of 80,000 accurately reflects the number on ARV therapy.

Drinking just one cup of tea a day will lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer: squamos and basal cell carcinoma, according to the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology. "Teas have long been known to contain antioxidants in them, and also chemicals called polyfenals," says dermatologist Dr. Bryan Chen. In the first human study of more than 2,000 people tea's antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays. But Doctor Chen says tea isn't the cure all for skin cancer. "Just because you drink tea doesn't mean it's a 100% protection against the development of skin cancer. You really do need to do it in combination with other protective measures protect yourself from the sun." Scientists found the more tea you drink, each day and over the years, the better the skin protection. It doesn't matter if the tea is hot or cold, and all types of tea offered protection, including green, black and herbal tea.

Usually in the country of Canada if an elderly person breaks their hip, they are operated on the same day or the day after, but a new study shows that those who have to wait up to 4 days to be operated on are at risk of complications and death. A report released by The Canadian Institute for Health Information, finds that in 2005 and 2006, approximately 17 thousand surgeries were performed in patients over the age of 65, not including Quebec. About 6% of these patients died in hospital within 30 days of their admission. The mortality risk for patients who waited 4 days or more after being admitted to hospital for hip surgery was 22% higher than it was for patients who received surgery the same day or one day after the injury occured. "Hip fractures represent a tremendous health burden for seniors. Recovery is often slow and painful, and many patients experience a loss of mobility and other health problems," says Dr. Michael Dunbar, associate professor of Orthopedic Surgery at Dalhousie University.

It has been scientifically concluded that a 100 per cent smoke-free environment is the only way out from the devastating effects of second hand tobacco smoke. A smoke-free inside creates an enjoyable, healthy lifestyle and a prosperous future. For this, all indoor workplaces must be smoke free. Evidences show that if we are able to restrict tobacco consumption, health-related ailments will go down drastically, which in the long run reduces the burden of poverty. World No Tobacco Day is an annual advocacy event commemorated by the member states of the World Health Organisation (WHO) to mark the global tobacco free initiative. The theme of the day is chosen each year on the basis of the emerging public health problem caused by the untoward effects of tobacco. Global health faces enormous challenges from a variety of tobacco products like cigarettes, bidi, gutkha and others. This year's global alert on second hand smoke-free environment is realistic from a variety of contexts. Of the 4.9 million global deaths from tobacco, countries in the South East Asia region accounts for 1.2 million. The smoke from burning tobacco products, generated by people smoking them, refers to second hand smoke. Breathing second hand tobacco smoke is detrimental to human health. When tobacco smoke contaminates the air, especially enclosed spaces, it is taken in by everyone present there. It exposes both smokers and non-smokers to maximum harmful effects. In this situation, people that are not actively smoking are also compelled to inhale smoke from tobacco products. A series of scientific evidences have shown that second hand tobacco is also believed to be a cause for cancer. Of the over 4,000 known chemicals in tobacco smoke, more than 50 are accountable for cancer in humans. Let aside the consequences of direct smoking, second hand smoke is also attributed to cardiovascular ailments and many serious types of respiratory and heart diseases, which might lead to death. Scientifically, it has been proved that neither ventilation nor filtration can reduce the impact of tobacco smoke exposure. In this regard, only 100 per cent smoke-free environment is an effective protection. Second hand smoking occurs anywhere, any time where smoking is permitted. Homes, offices, schools, colleges, workplaces and vehicles are such places. As per a recent WHO report, around 700 million children breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke. Home is believed to be the prime place for second hand smoke. Second hand smoke is a predisposing factor for the heavy global burden of diseases and unnecessary economic burden. Evidences accumulated over the last four decades reveal a bleak picture about the rising status of heart, lung cancer, asthma and other such diseases. Given this scenario, member countries wanting to place stricter control on tobacco consumption face hardships due to the low level of awareness about the health risks of tobacco. The tobacco industries are also trying their best to continue their onslaught with new products promoted as being safer and healthier. They come with healthier names or fruity flavours or a more attractive packaging. So long as we fail to empower our people, organisations and policymakers with accurate information about tobacco products, their forms and disguises, the high sounding propaganda against tobacco will do nothing. In our context, the Ministry of Health and Population, along with its subordinate wing, the National Health Education, Information and Communication Centre (NHEICC), is entrusted with implementing the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and other precautionary ways for creating mass awareness. But it is an irony that smoking has not gone down. The FCTC is a global public health treaty developed in response to the globalisation of the tobacco epidemic aimed at reducing the burden of diseases caused by tobacco consumption. It provides for the widest possible international co-operation necessary to control illnesses caused by the consumption of tobacco and a sharp rise in poverty. So far, 125 countries have ratified the convention, but in our case, nothing concrete has been achieved in this regard. Due to government's indifference towards the FCTC, the pace of development in the field of tobacco control has been lagging behind. Who is to blame for the non-implementation of the FCTC? Besides, the health tax fund raised from cigarettes has not been properly utilised.

All I do is ask questions Euro donor card &lsquo;could solve organ crisis&rsquo; David Charter in Brussels Proposals for a European organ donor card, to tackle record waiting lists for transplants, emerged yesterday after figures showed that ten people died every day while waiting for a transplant in Europe. The proposals from the European Commission did not go far enough for the British Medical Association, which urged a system of presumed consent so that organs could be used from all potential donors unless an individual had opted out. In Britain, where the waiting list for organs reached a record high of 7,234 at the end of March, nearly nine out of ten people believe that carrying a national donor card is a good idea, but only one in four people actually carries one. Britain also has one of the highest family refusal rates in the EU, with 42 per cent of relatives blocking organ removal, compared with 17 per cent in Spain, 29 per cent in Italy and 30 per cent in France. Only the Greeks were more reluctant among 12 nations surveyed, with 46 per cent of relatives telling doctors not to remove organs for transplant. John Oliver, of UK Transplant, the organisation that oversees organ donation, said: &ldquo;Britain&rsquo;s high relative refusal rate is the single biggest barrier to more lives being saved. Four out of ten people identified as suitable donors do not go on to donate because their relatives refuse. One of the main reasons is because the family, at a traumatic time, say they have never discussed it.&rdquo; Officials at the European Commission believe that a debate concerning an EU donor card would stimulate discussion in families so that people&rsquo;s wishes were well known. The BMA said: &ldquo;We would welcome any attempt to create public debate about the problem of organ shortages but we would prefer to see an opt-out system or presumed consent as part of a package of measures to improve the success of organ donation.&rdquo; Research released by the EU yesterday showed a big gap between those in member states who thought that carrying a donor card was a good idea (81 per cent) and those who carried a card. The Commission published its plans as a dispute intensified over a Dutch television programme, due to be broadcast tomorrow, in which a terminally ill patient will choose which of three people will receive her kidneys when she dies. Research showed that the Dutch were the most likely to carry organ donor cards. A total of 44 per cent carried their national card, compared with 26 per cent in Britain and an EU average of 12 per cent. Nobody in Hungary was found by researchers to be carrying a donor card. Markos Kyprianou, the EU Health Commissioner, will also discuss with member states whether a symbol showing an individual&rsquo;s willingness to donate organs should be included on the European health card &ndash; the card necessary for free treatment across the union. &ldquo;With eight out of ten Europeans favouring organ donor cards but only one in ten actually carrying one, there is clearly huge potential to increase the availability of organs for donation,&rdquo; Mr Kyprianou said.

The studies are published in today's edition of the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) Degenerative spondylolisthesis (DS, also known as slipped vertebra or slipped disk) is where one or more verterbra in the spine become misaligned and press on nerves in the spinal cord, resulting in severe leg pains. It generally occcurs after the age of 50. It affects around 600,000 Americans and is seen six times more often in women than in men; it is especially prevalent among African-American women. On its own DS is usually symptom-free, but sometimes it affects the spinal canal, making it narrower (spinal stenosis) which puts pressure on the nerves resulting in pain in the legs, such as when going for a walk. study, led by researchers at the Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire, US, showed that surgery was twice as effective as non-surgical treatment in reducing pain and helping patients with DS and spinal stenosis get back to normal. Before this study, there were no controlled trials on the effectiveness of surgery to treat DS with spinal stenosis. The researchers recruited 607 patients from 13 medical centres in 11 US states who had at least 12 weeks of symptoms which had been confirmed as DS. They were assigned to either a randomized cohort or an observational cohort. The outcomes were measured using a range of medical, disability, general health and pain assessment questionnaires at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months, and at 1 and 2 years. The results showed that 372 patients had surgery within two years (decompressive laminectomy, with or without fusion) and 235 had non-surgical treatments that included physical therapy, steroid injections, and drugs. Two years after enrollment, patients who had received surgical treatment reported significantly reduced pain and improved functionality as early as six weeks after intervention, while those who did not receive surgery reported only modest improvements. The researchers concluded that: "In nonrandomized as-treated comparisons with careful control for potentially confounding baseline factors, patients with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis treated surgically showed substantially greater improvement in pain and function during a period of 2 years than patients treated nonsurgically." Sciatica is often caused by displaced spinal disks putting pressure on the sciatic nerve resulting in painful burning sensations or numbness down one side of the body, mostly in the leg. 75 per cent of cases resolve on their own without surgery, but worldwide around 1.5 million operations are carried out to remove all or part of the disk to relieve the pressure on the sciatic nerve. study, led by Dutch researchers based at Leiden University Medical Center, showed that microdiskectomy surgery relieved pain faster than conservative treatments based on physical therapy and drugs, although 95 per cent of sciatica patients were free of pain within 12 months whether they had surgery or not. Patients with sciatica are often referred to surgery if the symptoms persist more than 6 weeks, but there is little well researched information on the best time to have the operation. The researchers randomly assigned 283 patients who had been experiencing severe sciatica symptoms for 6 to 12 weeks to one of two groups. The first group was referred for early surgery while the second group had prolonged conservative treatment (physical therapy and drugs), with surgery if needed. Both groups were monitored using questionnaires about disability, leg pain, and perceived recovery in the first year of the trial. 125 (89 per cent) of the 141 patients referred for early surgery had a microdiskectomy after an average of 2.2 weeks. 55 (39 per cent) of the 142 patients who were referred for prolonged conservative treatment had surgery after an average of 18.7 weeks. The results showed no difference in overall disability scores during the first year. However, relief from leg pain was faster among the early surgery patients, and this group also reported a faster rate of perceived recovery. But after one year of follow up, the percentage of patients who described themselves as recovered was the same, at 95 per cent. The researchers concluded that: "The 1-year outcomes were similar for patients assigned to early surgery and those assigned to conservative treatment with eventual surgery if needed, but the rates of pain relief and of perceived recovery were faster for those assigned to early surgery."

Meanwhile, Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari repeated her earlier statement that drug manufacturer Baxter Healthcare Corp. planned to start clinical trials of a bird flu vaccine in the country in July. A spokesman for Baxter previously denied the company had announced such a plan, and refused to comment further. The company has previously announced clinical trials of vaccines in Europe. Supari, reached Thursday after Baxter&#039;s comment, said in a statement: "I don&#039;t know about that (the Baxter denial), what I know is that this July clinical trials will start." The country&#039;s latest bird flu victim came from a village in central Java province, said Muhammad Nadirin, an official at the Health Ministry. The 45-year-old died Monday after being hospitalized for two days, he said. Today in Asia - Pacific Thailand facing uncertainty after court ruling An escapee tells of life and death in North Korea&#x27;s labor camps U.S. and India closer to nuclear agreement Nadirin said the man had slaughtered, cooked, then eaten an infected chicken a week before he developed bird flu symptoms on May 17. The man&#039;s death raised Indonesia&#039;s total number of bird flu infections to 98 &#8212; 78 of them fatal &#8212; since the virus re-emerged in Asia in 2003. Bird flu remains essentially an animal disease, but experts fear it may mutate into a form easily transferrable between humans and trigger a global pandemic, possibly killing millions. The vaccines currently under production may offer some protection against any pandemic strain, but there is no guarantee. Experts say it could take six months before they could be adjusted to provide full protection. In February, Baxter signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia for development of a bird flu vaccine using the Indonesian strain of the virus, but no formal deal has been signed yet. Supari told The Associated Press on Wednesday that Baxter&#039;s "clinical trial involving hundreds of participants will start in July" and should be concluded by October.

"The suspicion is that, at these parties, they had unsafe sex with people they had drugged, and also that these people were injected with infected blood," Zwarter said. The four suspects &#8212; all of whom have HIV, the virus that causes AIDS &#8212; were arrested May 13, he said. Two of the suspects have confessed to injecting the victims, he said. "The motive to do this was the &#039;kick,&#039; and the feeling that unsafe sex is &#039;pure,&#039;" Zwarter said. Russian denies involvement in Litvinenko killing Bicycle programs catching on in major cities Europe leads in designing buildings that save energy Prosecution spokesman Paul Heidanus said Thursday that the two who confessed would face charges of rape and "premeditated severe assault," which carries a maximum sentence of 16 years in prison. He said they would not be charged with attempted murder "because of a Supreme Court ruling that found AIDS should no longer be seen as an inevitably fatal disease, but rather a chronic illness," Heidanus said. The investigation was still ongoing to determine exactly what crimes might have been committed by the third suspect, who Heidanus said was "involved in the sex parties." The fourth suspect would face drugs charges for allegedly selling "a considerable amount of drugs," including Ecstasy and GHB, an intoxicant that is sometimes known as a "date rape" drug, police said in a statement. The fourth man was not suspected of involvement in the rapes, Heidanus said. The arrests followed complaints from at least five men who said they had been raped. "The victims said they had had been made helpless or unconscious and then abused," a police statement said. "They had ... involuntary and unsafe sex with one or more of the suspects." All of the victims said they believed they had been infected with HIV as a result. A judge on May 16 ordered the suspects be held for 90 days. Police said they did not rule out further arrests, and urged other victims to come forward or to contact a help line to receive HIV testing.

As VOA's Jessica Berman reports, the international bodies say health providers should offer to test people instead of waiting for patients to request HIV tests. A young HIV-infected woman lying in an Abidjan hospital In issuing new guidelines, UNAIDS and the WHO said 80 percent of people who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS are unaware of their situation. An estimated 40 million people throughout the world are living with HIV. More than 60 percent live in Africa. Kevin De Cock, the director of the HIV/AIDS program at the World Health Organization, says the guidelines are essential if people are to be treated. "We think these new guidelines are extremely important as we struggle to move towards universal access to prevention, treatment, care and support which the countries of the world have committed to," he said. Instead of waiting for patients at walk-in clinics and hospitals to request HIV tests, Paul De Lay of UNAIDS, says the guidelines urge health care workers to offer HIV tests as a routine part of medical care. "It encourages health care providers to recommend an HIV test to people who show symptoms of illness, or who likely benefit in health terms from an HIV test," he said. But the officials say under no circumstances should people be coerced into taking a test, nor should one be administered without their consent. The officials say those who test positive must also receive counseling afterward. In addition to getting AIDS treatment they might ordinarily not receive, De Cock says people who know their HIV status are less likely to spread the infection to others. "There are data from the United States certainly showing safer behavior once people know their HIV infection status. Because the overwhelming majority of HIV-infected people wish to do everything they can to prevent transmission to others," he said. Experts say it is unclear how the recommendations for HIV testing will be received in cash-strapped nations, particularly in Africa. According to one expert, the health care systems in many countries are in disarray, and many people who are HIV-positive fail to seek care until they are very sick.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/19-3&fd=R&url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/lifestyle/2007-05/30/content_883678.htm&cid=1116798088&ei=m-xeRuzZAoL0rQOB45zVDQ Natural compound in grapes, tea and cocoa helps boost memory Natural compound in grapes, tea and cocoa helps boost memory A study of mice has shown that a natural compound found in blueberries, tea, grapes, and cocoa has the potential to enhance memory, and that its effects further increase when combined with regular exercise. A study of mice has shown that a natural compound found in blueberries, tea, grapes, and cocoa has the potential to enhance memory, and that its effects further increase when combined with regular exercise. The compound pointed at by the researchers is epicatechin, one of a group of chemicals known as flavonols that has been shown previously to improve cardiovascular function in people and increase blood flow in the brain. In the latest study, Dr. Henriette van Praag of the California based Salk Institute for Biological Studies and her colleagues found that the combination of exercise, and a diet with epicatechin promoted structural and functional changes in the dentate gyrus, a part of the brain involved in the formation of learning and memory. Published in The Journal of Neuroscience, their findings suggest that a diet rich in flavonols may help reduce the incidence or severity of neurodegenerative disease or cognitive disorders related to ageing. "This finding is an important advance because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory-enhancing effects, suggesting that it may be possible to optimize brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation," says Dr. Mark Mattson at the National Institute on Ageing. The researchers compared mice who were fed a typical diet with those given a diet supplemented with epicatechin. Half the mice in each group were made to run on a wheel for two hours each day. After a period of one month, the researchers trained mice to find a platform hidden in a pool of water. They noticed that mice who both exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice. Upon a study of the brains of these mice, the researchers observed a greater blood vessel growth in the dentate gyrus and a more mature nerve cells, an indication of enhanced ability of the cells to communicate. The researchers further said that the combination of epicatechin and exercise had a beneficial effect on the expression of genes important for learning and memory, and decreased the activity of genes playing a role in inflammation and neurodegeneration. They say that though sedentary mice fed epicatechin showed enhanced memory, blood vessel growth, and gene activity during the study, such benefits were even more evident in mice that also exercised. "A logical next step will be to study the effects of epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals, and then humans, combined with mild exercise, " says van Praag.

Despite the sub-Saharan country being crippled by economic crisis and deep recession, health workers have been praised for their efforts to keep the HIV prevalence rate down. Since 2001, the number of people infected by the disease in the country has fallen from 25 per cent to just 18.1 per cent of the population. According to reports, the number of people who will have regular access to anti-retroviral treatments will increase by 40,000 in December, having already risen from 60,000 to 80,000 this month. Zimbabwe&#39;s health minister David Parirenyatwa said this week: "Currently the number of people on ARVs has grown to 80,000 since December last year and we hope to achieve our target of getting 120,000 by the end of the year." Meanwhile, government officials in Zimbabwe are expected to attend a conference on human trafficking which is set to kick off this week. The three-day event in will focus on the problem of human trafficking in southern and will bring together representatives from 14 countries on the continent. According to recent figures, up to one million people are taken across borders illegally each year, many of who are vulnerable women and children. | 01223 365589 | "SOS Children" refers to SOS Kinderdorf worldwide.

Dutch police arrested four men in connection with the case in the northern city of Groningen earlier this month. They include a gay couple from the city of Slochteren, both aged 48, and a 33-year-old gay man from Groningen. The three are suspected of organizing sex parties where they injected victims with HIV-contaminated blood taken from themselves. Two of them have admitted that they arranged dates with gay men through Internet chat rooms. At the parties, they secretly spiked the drinks of the victims with GHB, commonly known as the "date rape drug", sometimes in combination with ecstasy. The victims were then sexually abused and injected with infected blood. The Dutch public prosecution department has charged the three with rape and serious assault. They could face a maximum penalty of 16 years in prison. "The life expectancy of the victims can be extended with medication and as a result the suspects cannot be charged with manslaughter or murder," the spokesperson for the prosecution office explained. This means that even if it were certain that one or more of their victims would eventually die of AIDS as a direct result of the injections, the offenders will not be convicted of murder. The fourth man, a 34-year-old drug dealer from Groningen, is suspected of supplying the GHB and ecstasy. He was found to be in possession of a large amount of drugs. The other three suspects also have the drugs. The sex parties took place in the homes of the suspects or their victims. According to the police, the suspects did it just for fun and because they found unprotected sex to be "pure". The suspects had also injected one another with their infected blood. Five victims between the ages of 25 and 50 have reported to the police so far, of whom four have filed charges. The police said some of them have become HIV-positive as a result of the injections. Twelve men have reported to the regional health authority in Groningen that they were possibly infected with HIV during gay parties in the city. It is not known whether the men have actually been infected. Police suspect that there are more victims and are calling on them to report to the authorities. Last year the Groningen health authority noticed an increase in HIV infections and warned homosexuals against visiting these parties.

Barack Obama, D-Ill., talks with Dr. Mark Anderson while touring a cardiology research lab before speaking about his health care plan, Tuesday, at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa. IOWA CITY, Iowa &#8211; Democratic presidential hopeful Barack Obama on Tuesday offered a plan to provide health care to millions of Americans and more affordable medical insurance, financed in part by tax increases on the wealthy. Bemoaning a health care &#8220;cost crisis,&#8221; Obama said it was unacceptable that 47 million in the country are uninsured while others are struggling to pay their medical bills. He said the time is ripe for reforming the health care system despite an inability to do so in the past, most notably when rival Hillary Rodham Clinton pursued major changes during her husband's presidency. Michelle Obama razzes her husband, but says he doesn't mind &#8220;We can do this,&#8221; Obama said in a speech in Iowa City at the University of Iowa's medical school. &#8220;The climate is far different than it was the last time we tried this in the early nineties.&#8221; Obama's plan retains the private insurance system but injects additional money to pay for expanding coverage. Those who can't afford coverage would get a subsidy on a sliding scale depending on their income, and virtually all businesses would have to share in the cost of coverage for their workers. Obama didn't mention that his plan would cost the federal treasury an estimated $50 billion to $65 billion a year once fully implemented. That information was provided in a memo written by three outside experts and distributed by the campaign after his speech. The experts also said Obama could pay for his plan mostly through steps that the candidate has already said he would take &#8211; allowing President Bush's tax cuts on dividends and capital gains and on those making more than about $250,000 a year to expire in 2010 instead of acting to make them permanent. The rest of the $65 billion funding could come by raising taxes on inheritances worth more than $7 million. Many Democrats want to repeal Bush's elimination of taxes on estates worth more than $1 million. Obama wants the exemption to be higher but has not yet said exactly where it should be set. Obama's proposal would spend more money boosting technology in the health industry such as electronic record-keeping. His package would prohibit insurance companies from refusing coverage because of pre-existing conditions. It would also create a National Health Insurance Exchange to monitor insurance companies and limit their profits. Obama said the typical consumer would save $2,500 a year on premiums. Obama's first promise as a presidential candidate was that he would sign a universal health care plan into law by the end of his firm term in the White House. But there is some dispute over whether his plan would provide universal care &#8211; it's aimed at lowering costs so all Americans can afford insurance, but does not guarantee everyone would buy it. &#8220;It's not totally clear that it would result in universal coverage,&#8221; said Ron Pollack, executive director of the advocacy group Families USA. He praised Obama and other leading Democratic candidates for focusing on improving health care. &#8220;What makes it a top national priority now is not simply a sense of sympathy for people who are uninsured but a sense of fear that the coverage that used to be taken for granted can no longer be taken for granted,&#8221; he said. Obama aides said they believe that everyone would buy health insurance if it were affordable enough, achieving universal care. If some Americans are still uninsured after a few years into the plan, Obama would reconsider how to get to 100 percent, the advisers said. That's where he differs with Democratic rival John Edwards, the only other candidate who has laid out a specific plan. Edwards eventually would require every American to get health insurance, much like state requirements that drivers have auto insurance. Obama would only require that children be covered. Edwards spokesman Mark Kornblau said Edwards' plan, estimated to cost between $90 billion and $120 billion annually, is &#8220;truly universal.&#8221; &#8220;He believes that incremental measures are not enough,&#8221; Kornblau said. &#8220;Any plan that does not cover all Americans is simply inadequate.&#8221; In a CNN-Opinion Research poll conducted earlier this month, about two-thirds said the government should provide national health insurance for all Americans, even if it would mean higher taxes. Clinton has promised universal health care but has yet to provide specifics. Associated Press Writer Nedra Pickler in Washington contributed to this report.

New legislation to ban smoking in public would be a key step forward, the ministry said in the newly released 2007 Report on China's Smoking Control. The report, the nation's first official report on smoke control, was released before today's World No Tobacco Day. China now has no laws designed specifically to ban smoking in public. The law on tobacco monopolies, which came into effect in 1991, prohibited smoking on public transport and some other areas. However, the law was not strictly enforced. China is the world's largest tobacco producing and consuming country, accounting for more than a third of the global total on both counts. The tobacco industry has been the biggest tax source since 1987, which accounted for about 240 billion yuan (US$31.4 billion) of tax revenue in 2005, according to the report. About 540 million Chinese suffer from passive smoking and more than 100,000 of them die annually from diseases caused by passive smoking, according to the report. Among passive smoking victims, about 180 million were children younger than 15, the report said. The World Health Organization estimated that about 700 million children worldwide suffered from passive smoking. People in rural areas were more inclined to fall prey to passive smoking as 54 percent had contact with second-hand smoke, the report said. In urban areas, the number was 49.7 percent. More than half the population in 20 provinces across China were exposed to passive smoking while the figures in the provinces of Qinghai, Gansu, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Jilin, as well as the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were above 60 percent, the report said. Homes were found to offer the easiest access to second-hand smoking. This was the finding of a 2002 survey where 82 percent of the respondents agreed, the report said. The report also revealed that a cigarette can produce more than 4,000 chemical substances when it is lit, including more than 40 carcinogens such as formaldehyde, benzene and arsenic. Second-hand smoking has been identified as an A-level carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, a body under WHO.

The letter ``clarifies the safety record of Avandia,&#39;&#39; Glaxo said today in a statement. Glaxo shares have dropped about 9.3 percent, wiping out almost 7.88 billion pounds ($15.6 billion) in market value, since a May 21 report in the New England Journal of Medicine said that patients taking Avandia, the company&#39;s second-best-selling drug, were 43 percent more likely to have a heart attack. Glaxo Chief Medical Officer Ronald Krall said in the letter today that studies in progress will provide more information on safety. ``The drug use and approval system is working,&#39;&#39; Krall wrote. ``We should stay the course and allow ongoing trials to provide their definitive answers.&#39;&#39; The stock rose 22 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 1,328 pence in London. Earlier today, the shares had declined as much as 2.8 percent after analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co., the world&#39;s biggest brokerage, recommended investors sell the stock because of the reported heart risks. ``Although these findings seem scientifically questionable to us and are unlikely to support near-term product withdrawal or major litigation, we believe that share price risks are nonetheless skewed to the downside,&#39;&#39; Merrill Lynch analysts, including Graham Parry, wrote today in a research note. Avandia&#39;s share of new oral diabetes prescriptions fell to about zero from 10 percent in the two days after publication of the New England Journal article, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a research note yesterday, citing data from market research firm Impact Rx. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.&#39;s diabetes drug Actos&#39; share climbed to 22 percent from 10 percent, the analysts wrote. Takeda shares reached a two-month high today after the Deutsche Bank report. The stock gained 90 yen, or 1.1 percent, to 8,020 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. ImpactRx disagrees with Deutsche Bank&#39;s interpretation of its data, the market research firm said yesterday in a PR Newswire press release. ``We believe insufficient time has elapsed since publication and it&#39;s premature to conclude any dramatic or lasting changes in physician prescribing behavior at this point,&#39;&#39; Impact Rx President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Altus said in the statement. Analysts have expected new Avandia prescriptions to decline since last week. Some doctors who treat diabetes report they are considering treatment alternatives for newly diagnosed patients. ``I don&#39;t think people will be pulled off drugs because of it,&#39;&#39; Rury Holman, professor of diabetic medicine and director of the Diabetes Trials Unit at Oxford University, who has done clinical trials for Glaxo, said in a telephone interview today. ``I think you will see new starts will go down.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporter on this story: Andrea Gerlin in London Last Updated: May 30, 2007 12:56 EDT Related Media on Demand Steven Nissen Sees Concern For Glaxo&#39;s Avandia Drug FTSE 100 Stocks Advance, Led by Johnson Matthey, HBOS, BHP Billion Shares Altadis Default Swaps Fall on Speculation of New Bid From Imperial Tobacco Man Group Reports 27 Percent Jump in Full-Year Profit as Assets Increase

In line with the World Health Organisation Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, government is finalising commitment documents to make Uganda smoke-free. The convention demands government commitment to compel manufacturers to label cigarettes with a bigger and clearer warning that tobacco kills and to make them contribute to the rehabilitation of addicted smokers. Tobacco is dangerous to every organ in the body. According to WHO, it is the second major cause of death in the world. Every eight seconds someone somewhere is killed as a result of tobacco use. It is currently responsible for the death of one in 10 adults worldwide (about 5 million deaths each year). If current smoking patterns continue, it will cause some 10 million deaths each year by 2020. Half the people that smoke today - that is about 650 million people - will eventually be killed by tobacco. Passive smoking is even more dangerous. It is a killer. In spite of the fact that Uganda has a law against smoking in public, it is not enforced because most of the public, who should play a watchdog role, are ignorant of the dangers of passive smoking. Children exposed to second-hand smoking are at increased rate of sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, cancer and more severe asthma. The only sure protection is to have a smoke-free environment. It is even not viable to carve out smoke zones because smoke will float to non-smokers in the same zone. There is need to create supportive laws and to sensitise the public so that those who abuse the law are sued for compensation. Proprietors of public places must hang up clear signs of &#39;No Smoking&#39; and enforce it. The National Bureau of Standards should enforce international standard labels which are big, pictorial and mention death.

The results, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine , also reports that regular consumption of the nuts led to reductions in cholesterol levels, and may offer a " practical, safe and inexpensive modality to reduce blood pressure," "In this eight-week crossover trial, soy nuts containing 25 g of soy protein and 101 mg of aglycone lowered blood pressure in hypertensive and normotensive postmenopausal women compared with the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet without soy," wrote lead author Francine Welty, from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston. "To our knowledge, this is the first study to directly compare the effects of a whole soy food in normotensive and hypertensive individuals." In the UK alone, there are an estimated 10m people with , defined as having blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg. The condition is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), which causes almost 50 per cent of deaths in Europe, and is reported to cost the EU economy an estimated &#8364;169bn ($202bn) per year. The new study recruited 60 healthy post-menopausal women (average age 56, average BMI 26.7 kg per sq m) and assigned them to eat two diets for eight weeks each in random order. The first diet, the TLC diet, consisted of 30 per cent of calories from fat (with 7 per cent or less from saturated fat), 15 per cent from protein and 55 per cent from carbohydrates; 1,200 milligrams of calcium per day; two meals of fatty fish (such as salmon or tuna) per week; and less than 200 milligrams of cholesterol per day. The second diet had the same calorie, fat and protein content, but the 25 grams of protein was replaced with one-half cup of unsalted soy nuts. The researchers took blood samples and pressure measurements at the beginning and end of each eight-week period. At the beginning of the study, 12 women were classed as hypertensive, with the remaining 48 being normotensive. "Soy nut supplementation significantly reduced systolic [top number] and diastolic [bottom number] blood pressure in all 12 hypertensive women and in 40 of the 48 normotensive women," Indeed, hypertensive women consuming the soy nuts as part of the TLC diet experienced systolic and diastolic blood pressure reductions of 9.9 per cent and 6.8 per cent, respectively, while normotensive women experienced reductions and 5.2 per cent and 2.9 per cent, respectively. "A 12-millimetre of mercury decrease in systolic blood pressure for 10 years has been estimated to prevent one death for every 11 patients with stage one hypertension treated; therefore, the average reduction of 15 milligrams of mercury in systolic blood pressure in hypertensive women in the present study could have significant implications for reducing cardiovascular risk and death on a population basis," In addition to blood pressure reductions, the women with high blood pressure at the start of the study also experienced beneficial changes in levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL - "bad") cholesterol and apoliprotein B (a particle that carries LDL cholesterol), with reductions reported of 11 and eight per cent, respectively. "Levels of triglyceride were seven per cent and 11 per cent lower in normotensive and hypertensive women, respectively, in the soy diet arm compared with the control arm," "Although these reductions were not statistically significant, their magnitude is similar to reductions in triglyceride levels observed in other soy studies and may have clinical relevance, especially since triglyceride levels are stronger predictors of cardiovascular risk in women than in men." The researchers suggest that the isoflavone content of the soy nuts may be responsible for the beneficial changes to blood pressure, but also not that when provided in isolation in the form of supplements, similar benefits were not observed in other studies, suggesting that isoflavones may work synergistically. "This study was performed in the free-living state; therefore, dietary soy may be a practical, safe and inexpensive modality to reduce blood pressure. If the findings are repeated in a larger group they may have important implications for reducing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women on a population basis," Archives of Internal Medicine Volume 167, Pages 1060-1067 "Effect of Soy Nuts on Blood Pressure and Lipid Levels in Hypertensive, Prehypertensive, and Normotensive Postmenopausal Women" Authors: F.K.

That leaves many patients worried that they will get worse if they don't have surgery&#151;yet uncomfortably short of information to help them decide if surgery is worth the risks. Now, that murky picture is brightening: In the past six months, three studies have made it much clearer when back surgery is a good option. The bottom line: It all depends on what's wrong. People with sciatica, in which a disk in the lower back presses on nerve roots and causes sharp pain in a leg or foot, might want to wait and see, for example. Most people with sciatica get better within three months, with or without surgery. People With Sciatica Felt Better Faster With Surgery For Spinal Stenosis, Surgery Works Well In the study, patients showed equal improvement after one year whether they had surgery or used such noninvasive approaches as painkillers and exercise. But those who had surgery to remove the piece of bulging disk early on, six to 12 weeks after the beginning of symptoms, said their leg pain got better faster, researchers at Leiden University in the Netherlands reported in the May 31 New England Journal of Medicine . And about 40 percent of the patients who didn't get early surgery later went on to have an operation. For those whose pain persists, a faster recovery may be worth the pain and risk of complications from surgery. A second study found that surgery seems to be a good bet for people with degenerative spondylolisthesis and spinal stenosis. In this tongue-numbing diagnosis, a vertebra slips out of alignment and presses on the spinal cord, and the bony canal in the spinal column is narrowed by arthritis, pinching nerves. This causes pain in the back or legs that gradually becomes worse. The condition is common in older people and is the No. 2 cause of back surgery in the United States, after herniated disks. The surgery typically involves fusing two vertebrae together and removing bone and soft tissue pressing on nerves. James Weinstein, an orthopedic surgeon at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center who led the study, says he was surprised that the patients who avoided surgery didn't do better. In a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association last November, Weinstein and his colleagues found that people with pain due to a herniated disk did just as well after a year with or without surgery. "Age is an issue here," says Weinstein, noting that people with slipped disks are typically in their 40s and thus may recover faster on their own.

US health officials Tuesday urged hundreds of travelers aboard two Air France and Czech Air flights be tested for a drug-resistant tuberculosis carried by a passenger now quarantined US health officials Tuesday urged that hundreds of travelers aboard two Air France and Czech Air flights be tested for a drug-resistant tuberculosis carried by a passenger now quarantined. Julie Gerberding, head of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters that the drug-resistant XDR strain of tuberculosis can cause severe illness or death. "Most likely to be at risk would be the passengers who were seated in seats immediately close to the patient," she said, recommending these passengers and flight crews be tested for exposure. "The medical evidence would suggest this potential for transmission would be on the low side, but we know it isn't zero," she said. The infected passenger traveled on Air France flight A385 from Atlanta to Paris on May 12, and on a Czech Air flight from Prague to Montreal on May 24. A US citizen, the man has been placed in isolation in a hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, Gerberding said. It was the first time since 1963 the CDC issued such an order, a spokesman for the centers said. "We always want to balance personal liberties with the requirement to protect people's health," Gerberding said. "We felt it was our responsibility to err on the side of abundant caution and issue the isolation order." The CDC is "collaborating with US state and local health departments, international ministries of health, the airline industry and the World Health Organization," the CDC said. Canada's director general of the Public Health Agency's infectious disease and emergency preparedness branch, Howard Njoo, told reporters an estimated 200 people were aboard the Czech Air flight to Montreal. He said that after landing at Montreal, the patient rented a car and drove to the United States by way of the Champlain-New York border crossing. Njoo said the patient had apparently been told he was infected with TB before leaving Europe, but was unaware it involved the virulent XDR strain. The CDC reported that the patient was in good health and showed no TB symptoms such as coughing or fever, said Njoo, adding that the patient's relatives had all tested negative for TB. An analysis of the patient's sputum also tested negative, indicating a very low level of contagion, said the Canadian official. Echoing the CDC official, Njoo said the risk of contracting the disease even for people seated next to the patient was "minimal" since re-circulated air in aircraft is filtered for germs. Only two cases of XDR TB have been reported in Canada, in 2003 and 2006, he said. Air France officials, meanwhile, issued a brief statement saying they were "cooperating fully with all authorities involved and we are following all worldwide aviation practices for these matters." In September, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed 53 XDR TB cases in South Africa, all but one of them fatal, triggering a world-wide health alert. Most of the patients were also infected with the AIDS virus. More than 300 people have been diagnosed with XDR TB in South Africa, with an average of one new case per day, WHO said, adding that the TB strain has an 85 percent mortality rate when combined with the AIDS virus. Besides South Africa, more than 5,000 people in 18 other countries have been diagnosed with the virulent TB strain, but with a much lower mortality rate, WHO said. Tuberculosis, in all its variants, kills some two million people worldwide each year, mostly in developing countries. In the United States, TB is relatively rare, with only 13,700 cases reported last year.

Torisel was approved based on a study that showed use of the drug prolonged survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma. The drug is an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, cell growth and cell survival. "We have made significant advances in the battle against kidney cancer,&rdquo; said Steven Galson, M.D., M.P.H., director of the FDA&rsquo;s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Torisel is the third drug approved for this indication in the past 18 months, and one that shows an increased time in survival for some patients." The approval of Torisel follows the December 2005 approval of Nexavar (sorafenib), which was based on a delay in progression of disease. In January 2006, Sutent (sunitinib) received accelerated approval based on durable response rate, or tumor size reduction, and was later demonstrated to delay tumor progression. The safety and effectiveness of Torisel were shown in a clinical trial of 626 patients divided into three groups. One group received Torisel alone, another received a comparison drug called Interferon alfa, and a third received a combination of Torisel and interferon. The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.9 months for patients on Torisel alone versus 7.3 months for those treated with the interferon alone. Progression-free survival (when the disease does not get worse) increased from 3.1 months on the interferon alone arm to 5.5 months on the Torisel alone arm. The combination of Torisel and interferon did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with interferon alone. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 30 percent of Torisel-treated patients, were rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema, and loss of appetite. The most common laboratory abnormalities were high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and triglycerides, elevated liver and kidney blood tests, and low red cell, white cell, and platelet counts. Renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in about 51,000 people annually in the United States, accounts for about 85 percent of all U.S. adult kidney cancer.

Overall, the study by the Canadian Institute for Health Information found that nearly 25,000 seniors were admitted to hospital in Canada in 2005-2006 with a broken hip. Hospitalizations for hip fractures were down 13 per cent from five years earlier. But the report found that eight per cent of seniors admitted to hospitals outside Quebec with hip fractures spent four or more days in hospital before having surgery. Those who had to wait longer than the next day for surgery were 22 per cent more likely to die in hospital within 30 days of admission. "We find that there is a group that we could perhaps do a better job on," said Dr. Michael Dunbar, an orthopedic surgeon in Halifax who routinely sees elderly patients showing up in hospital in ``significant amounts of pain" after a fall. "We've identified some low-hanging fruit, a group that is waiting and subsequently is not having as good an outcome, particularly with respect to mortality. So it's an area where we could do better." Numerous factors can contribute to delays. Dunbar said they can occur because a patient has to be taken off blood-thinners before surgery, or may require a cardiac assessment first. Jennifer Zelmer, vice-president of research and analysis at CIHI, said the statistics were adjusted for these "patient factors," and the report revealed a number of other concerns related to wait times. "If you were transferred from one hospital to another, or if you're admitted to a larger hospital, or an afternoon or evening admit, or an admission on a weekday as opposed to a weekend, those patients were more likely to have their surgery later than others," said Zelmer, one of the authors of the report. The fact that surgery occurs more quickly when a person is admitted on a weekend might come as a surprise, but Zelmer said it has to do with the fact that someone is specifically on call on the weekend to handle trauma cases and can help a patient immediately. "Whereas on a weekday, they may be in the middle of a hip replacement, for example, or a scheduled surgery," she said. Dunbar agreed, noting that elective surgery isn't normally scheduled on weekends, so surgeons can start working on emergency cases such as fractured hips first thing in the morning. Broken hips are dealt with more quickly in small hospitals, the report found. "Seventy-four per cent, for example, got same day or next day surgery if they were admitted to a small hospital," Zelmer said. The number was 67 per cent for a medium or large community hospital, and 57 per cent for teaching hospitals. As for regional variations, those in Prince Edward Island, British Columbia and Nova Scotia were more likely to have surgery quickly, while patients in Manitoba and Saskatchewan were behind the national average. Health Minister Tony Clement noted that it's the first time CIHI has measured wait times for hip fracture surgery. "So before we didn't have a benchmark for this kind of surgery," he said. "We didn't have a specific target. But we can use this baseline information to measure how better or worse we do in the years ahead." The higher death rate among those who wait longer for surgery does not have have to do with problems in setting the bones, said Dunbar, but other factors. "Because you're immobilized, you're lying in bed, you can't move, you tend to get more urinary tract infections, you get more pneumonia because you can't get up and clear your lungs, you get pressure sores, and you get blood clots," he said. Dunbar pointed to the decline in the overall number of hip fractures â adjusted for population aging and population growth â as a positive thing. "What that says to me is our colleagues who have been working on prevention strategies like treating osteoporosis, identifying people at risk, working on fall prevention strategies, etc., have been effective in that they're reducing the incidence of hip fractures," he said.

The Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI) study released Wednesday found two-thirds of seniors who need surgery for a broken hip get it by the second day of admission to hospital. But eight per cent of Canadian seniors who have hip fractures, about 1,400 patients, wait four or more days for surgery.

"This is important new information," said Jennifer Zelmer, CIHI's vice-president of research and analysis, "because evidence suggests hip fracture patients who have surgery sooner tend to have better outcomes." The report says in 2005-06 there were 17,000 surgeries on patients over age 65 to repair broken hips in hospitals outside Quebec. Of these, 1,000 patients died in hospital within a month of admission. But the death rate for patients who waited longer for surgery was 22 per cent higher than for those who had it within two days of admission. The finding takes into account other factors affecting mortality such as age and other health problems, CIHI says. The report also found the quicker patients have surgery, the less time they will spend in hospital. Patients who had surgery on the day of admission or the following day spent an average of 18.5 days in hospital, compared to 20.5 days for those who waited longer. How quickly patients have hip fracture surgery varies across the country. Patients in Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia and British Columbia were more likely to have surgery with two days of admission. Those in Manitoba and Saskatchewan were least likely. The study says the rate of hospitalization for hip fracture surgery is declining across the country, from 575 surgeries per 100,000 seniors in 2000-01 to 502 per 100,000 in 2005-06. Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, New Brunswick and Newfoundland and Labrador had rates above the national average, while Manitoba, Quebec and Nova Scotia's were below. Christina Lawand of the CIHI said the results don't include Quebec because the latest comparable figures for that province weren't available. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

The man had historical contacts with fowls as a number of his chicken died and he also consumed ill-chickens, Coordinator of anti-bird flu center Dr Runizar Roesin said. "Both of his laboratory tests showed that he was positive of H5N1," he told Xinhua. "The man died on May 28 in Dr Mawardi hospital in Solo of Central Java," Roesin said. He said the man was sick on May 17 and went to see a doctor, said the coordinator. On May 24 the patient was admitted to another hospital in the province, and two days later he was admitted to a hospital in Solo town, the official said. Sample of specimen of his family has been taken for examination of bird flu, said Roesin. Indonesia has agreed to resume sharing its virus sample with the World Health Organization for scientific purpose after suspending the cooperation in December last year. Experts fear millions of people could be killed should the virus mutate to a certain level that is transmittable among humans. The disease has killed at least 186 people worldwide since it began ravaging Asian poultry stocks in 2003, and 78 were in Indonesia, the worst hit country.

At least 21 people using Advanced Medical&#039;s Complete MoisturePlus eye solution were infected with a potentially blinding germ, U.S. regulators said. The recalled cleaner for contact lenses accounted for 11 percent of the company&#039;s 2006 sales. Advanced Medical withdrew its forecast that adjusted profit this year would reach $1.40 to $1.55 a share, Randy Meier, the company&#039;s chief financial officer, said in a conference call. The recall will make it harder for Advanced Medical to carry out its plan to enter a bidding war for a rival, Bausch &#038; Lomb, analysts said. "The recall increases their financing costs," said Mark Mullikin, an analyst with Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "I don&#039;t know that Advanced Medical shareholders will be willing to swallow that, and Bausch &#038; Lomb shareholders are less likely to want to take Advanced Medical stock as part of the deal." Shares of Bausch &#038; Lomb fell $2.48, or 3.5 percent, to $68.01 in afternoon trading in New York. The stock had jumped above $70 after Advanced Medical said it was considering an offer to compete with the bid of $3.67 billion, or $65 a share, by Warburg Pincus. Today in Marketplace by Bloomberg BA shares surge on takeover talk Toyota&#x27;s North American growth expected to exceed forecast Lower fees, more deals allow Europe to close in on Wall Street Advanced Medical shares dropped $4.80, or 11.94 percent, to $35.40 in afternoon trading in New York, rebounding from a 15 percent decline in the morning. The stock lost 5.3 percent Thursday and Friday after management disclosed plans to bid for Bausch &#038; Lomb. Jim Mazzo, the chief executive, on Tuesday declined to comment on Advanced Medical&#039;s plans to make an offer for Bausch &#038; Lomb. Adding Bausch &#038; Lomb would help the smaller Advanced Medical expand in the eye care market and eliminate a 154-year-old rival, company executives said last week Bausch &#038; Lomb is recovering from its own recall last year of the ReNu with MoistureLoc solution because of a link to a different kind of eye infection. The company eventually withdrew its product entirely after it was tied to the potentially blinding fusarium keratitis eye fungus. After first appearing in Singapore and Hong Kong, the illness affected more than 150 people in the United States. MoistureLoc, introduced in the autumn of 2004, was used by about 2.3 million of the 34 million contact lens users in the United States and was Bausch &#038; Lomb&#039;s fastest-growing product. Investor raises stake in VW as safeguard The German state of Lower Saxony, Volkswagen&#039;s second-largest investor, on Tuesday spent &#8364;41 million, or $55 million, purchasing 376,000 shares in the largest European carmaker to protect its holding as employees exercise options. "We have prevented a watering down of the state&#039;s holding below 20 percent with the corresponding purchase of VW shares," Lower Saxony&#039;s prime minister, Christian Wulff, said in a statement. The purchases gives the state "a key role in the decision-making should the company&#039;s future and its production in Lower Saxony be at stake." Lower Saxony paid &#8364;112.26 a share to raise its voting stake to 20.36 percent from 20.23 percent. Workers beginning in July will have the right to exercise options that would increase the number of shares on the market, she said. Volkswagen is protected from a takeover by a 47-year-old German law that gives anyone with a 20 percent holding the right to block major decisions at the carmaker. The law, which is being challenged at the European Union&#039;s highest court, also limits voting rights in 20 percent even if the holding is larger. Shares of Volkswagen rose &#8364;2.11 to &#8364;113.95 in Frankfurt. The stock has gained 33 percent this year, valuing the carmaker at &#8364;40.5 billion. Porsche, Volkswagen&#039;s largest investor, supports abolishing the law. An advocate general for the European Court of Justice this year advised the court to strike down the law because it restricted "the free movement of capital." A four-week offer period expired Tuesday for Volkswagen shareholders to tender their holdings to Porsche, the maker of the 911 sports car, in a low-ball takeover bid. Porsche designed the offer to attain a controlling stake in Volkswagen rather than full ownership. Volkswagen investors had tendered 42,722 common shares and 20,567 preferred shares as of Friday, VW said. Porsche&#039;s total Volkswagen stake remained at about 30.92 percent of the voting rights. Sanyo narrows loss and forecasts profit Shares of Sanyo Electric, the world&#039;s largest maker of rechargeable batteries, rose the most in 18 months on Tuesday after its fourth-quarter loss narrowed and the company forecast its first annual profit in four years.

The Canadian Institute for Health Information's annual Health Indicators 2007 report analyzed wait times for hip fracture surgery. "For the first time, we can compare how quickly seniors who break a hip in different parts of the country undergo surgery," Jennifer Zelmer, CIHIâs vice-president of research and analysis, said in a release. "This is important new information, because evidence suggests that hip fracture patients who have surgery sooner tend to have better health outcomes." About eight per cent of seniors admitted to hospitals outside Quebec spent four or more days in hospital before having surgery, the report said. Nationally in 2005-2006, 65 per cent of patients on average had surgery the day they were admitted, or the next day. Patients in Manitoba (53 per cent) and Saskatchewan (56 per cent) wereÂ below the national average, while patients in Prince Edward Island (78 per cent), British Columbia (71 per cent) and Nova Scotia (69 per cent) wereÂ above. Slow, painful recoveryÂ for seniors Among patients who waited longer than the next day for surgery, the mortality rate within 30 days of admission was 22 per cent higher than for those who were treated sooner,Â after accounting for other factors such as age and other health problems. About 17,000 surgeries to repair hip fractures were done in patients 65 or older. In this group, 1,000 patients died, about six per cent. "Hip fractures represent a tremendous health burden for seniors," said Dr. Michael Dunbar, a professor of orthopedic surgery at Dalhousie University in Halifax. "Recovery is often slow and painful, and many patients experience a loss of mobility and other health problems." Research suggests that patients who wait longer for surgery to repair a broken hip are more likely to have complications, stay longer in hospital and show poorer recovery of function, Dunbar said. Osteoporosis, low physical activity, taking many medications, and a senior's physical surroundings are all linked with the risk of fracturing a hip, while fall-prevention strategies may help, said Greg Webster, a director of research at the institute. Hospitalization for hip fractures among seniors fell 13 per cent in five years,Â to 502Â hospitalizations per 100,000 seniors last year, down from 575 in 2000â2001, after taking population growth and aging into account.

The 31-year-old man walked into the facility wearing a mask around 8 a.m. and said he felt fine, Denver National Jewish Hospital spokesman William Allstetter said. Doctors plan to begin treating him immediately with two antibiotics, one oral and one intravenous. He also will undergo a basic physical exam, a test to evaluate how infectious he is and a CT scan and lung X-ray, Allstetter said. Doctors hope to also determine where he contracted the disease. He will be kept in a special unit with two rooms and a ventilation system, Allstetter said. "He may not leave that room much for several weeks," he said. The man, who has not been publicly identified beyond his age, knew he had TB when he flew from Atlanta to Europe in mid-May for his wedding and honeymoon, but he didn't find out until he was already there that it was an extensively drug-resistant strain considered especially dangerous. Despite warnings from federal health officials not to board another long flight, the man flew home for treatment. Health officials in North America and Europe are trying to track down about 80 passengers who sat near him on the two trans-Atlantic flights, and they want passenger lists from four shorter flights the man took while in Europe. Patients on the shorter flights are not expected to be as much at risk, health officials said. Among those being tested are more than two dozen University of South Carolina Aiken students, school spokeswoman Jennifer Lake said Thursday. Two were apparently sitting near the man, possibly in the same row, she said. One of those students, Laney Wiggins, said she is awaiting her skin test results, expected Friday. "I'm very nervous," Wiggins told The (Columbia) State newspaper. "It's kind of sad that this is overshadowing the wonderful time we had in Europe." The man flew to Paris on May 12 aboard Air France Flight 385, also listed as Delta Air Lines codeshare Flight 8517, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. He and his bride also took four shorter flights while in Europe &mdash; Paris to Athens on May 14; Athens to Thira Island May 16; Mykonos Island to Athens May 21; and Athens to Rome May 21 &mdash; but CDC officials said there was less risk of infection during the shorter hops compared to the trans-Atlantic flights, which each lasted eight hours or more. It was while the man was in Rome that he learned further U.S. tests had determined his TB was the rare, extensively drug-resistant form, far more dangerous than he knew. They told him turn himself over to Italian health officials and not to fly on any commercial airlines. Instead, on May 24, the man flew from Rome to Prague on Czech Air Flight 0727, then flew to Montreal aboard Czech Air Flight 0104 and drove into the U.S., according to CDC officials. Officials are trying to contact people who sat within five rows of him on the two longest flights for testing. Other passengers are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in the man was low, said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine. The infected man told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that doctors initially did not order him not to fly and only suggested he put off his long-planned wedding. "We headed off to Greece thinking everything's fine," he told the newspaper. Dr. Charles Daley, head of the infectious disease division at National Jewish, said the hospital has treated two other patients with what appears to be the same strain of tuberculosis since 2000, although that strain had not been identified and named at the time. He said the patients had improved enough to be released. Associated Press writers Mike Stobbe, Greg Bluestein and Daniel Yee in Atlanta contributed to this report.

[ Submit your comments below. ] Dr. Kenneth Castro, director, Division of Tuberculosis Elimination (left) and Dr. Martin Cetron, director, Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, talk with reporters Wednesday on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's investigation into people potentially exposed to extensively drug-resistant TB. COMPLETE COVERAGE OF I-75 BUS CRASH: Injured survivor recalls crash, another released MORE WORLD OF COCA-COLA How did infected man leave Atlanta? Rare strain shatters 'sense of complacency' Upset air travelers criticize CDC Atlantan quarantined with deadly TB strain Q&A: Extensively drug-resistant TB The man, identified by the Associated Press as Andrew Speaker, 31, was moved overnight from Grady Memorial Hospital, hospital officials confirmed. The AP, quoting an unidentified federal law enforcement official, said Speaker is a personal injury attorney who practices law with his father in Atlanta. He flew in a private Learjet that left Gwinnett County's Briscoe Field at 6:01 a.m. and arrived at Centennial Airport in suburban Denver at 8:45 a.m. He was transported to the the National Jewish Research and Medical Center south of Denver in a private ambulance. The man has told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution he would be treated at the facility, a leader in multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis research. As airline passengers around the world worried about whether they were exposed to the drug-resistent TB, public health experts were trying to figure out how Speaker was able to jet off on his honeymoon with the knowledge of government officials. The case, which has spawned an international health incident involving investigations in several countries, raises difficult questions about balancing the rights of an individual with the needs to protect the public, they said. And while his current confinement shows the system eventually worked, the experts questioned whether more could have been done before he ever left Atlanta. "I think this is going to be a lesson learned nationwide of the importance of local and county health departments being the front line of protection for the rest of the population," said Michael Greenberger, a law professor and director of the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security. The House Homeland Security Committee announced Tuesday it will hold a June 6 hearing examining health officials' response in the case. The TB patient, who is being confined under a federal isolation order, has told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he specifically told Fulton County health officials he was planning to leave the country for his wedding in Greece, then a honeymoon tour of Europe. He says they only told him they "preferred" he not travel. When pressed on what that meant, the man said they didn't say he couldn't travel. Speaker was diagnosed with multi-drug resistant TB prior to leaving the country. While that's serious, an even more serious diagnosis of extensively drug-resistant TB, also called XDR TB, was made after he was in Europe. While he was honeymooning in Rome, CDC officials asked him to agree to indefinite isolation in an Italian hospital. Instead he fled. Despite the CDC putting the man on airlines' "no fly" lists and having his passport flagged, the man and his bride were able to elude health authorities and sneak back into the United States by flying to Canada and driving across the border last week. Fulton County and Georgia state health officials said they believe Speaker was clearly informed that he shouldn't travel. But they also acknowledge that despite their conversations, as of May 10 they knew he intended to leave the country for his wedding. They also discussed with CDC officials Speaker's intent to fly for at least two days prior to him boarding a May 12 Atlanta to Paris flight, according to CDC spokesman Tom Skinner and Georgia's state epidemiologist Susan Lance. Skinner said Fulton County health officials contacted CDC on May 10 and said that Speaker, who at the time was diagnosed with multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, had told them he planned fly aboard airlines. The discussions continued on May 11, Skinner said. "We discussed with them several options to prohibit him from flying," Skinner said. All of those options involved actions that needed to be taken by state or local health authorities, he said. Skinner said CDC never heard back from local health officials until May 18 -- after Speaker had already left the United States. Lance said: "They gave us some options on how to proceed, but none of them were basically available," she said. She did not elaborate on what those options were. While Georgia health officials can obtain a court order to restrict the actions of a person or to even involuntarily commit them for treatment, Lance said the individual first needs to be served with a medical order telling them what they can and cannot do. "If they don't comply with the medical order, then we seek a court order to compel them to comply," Lance said. Fulton County health officials have said they tried to hand deliver Speaker a medical order telling him he could not travel, but that his home was vacant and he was not at his office when they tried to serve him with it on May 11. Lance said state and county health officials thought Speaker was departing at a later date, not on May 12 when he flew from Atlanta to Paris. "I think the Fulton County Department of Health and Wellness did their job to the best of their ability," Lance said, but she added that "there probably needs to be a review" of the state's laws and procedures governing restricting an ill person's travel. At a press conference Wednesday, Dr. Martin Cetron, director of CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, said health officials are focused right now on the evolving investigation, tracing the man's movements and identifying what passengers were closest to him on long flights -- those over 8 hours in duration -- to identify those who may be at risk. He noted that CDC officials are encouraged that the man continues to be "smear negative" which indicates he is at low risk of spreading the disease, that the man doesn't have any coughing or symptoms and that his wife continues to test negative for TB. "I think that is reassuring," he said. "Those are encouraging findings." However, the consequences would be great if the disease were to spread because treatments are so limited, Cetron said, especially for people who are immune compromised. That's why the CDC took the extraordinary step of isolating the patient and issuing an international health alert while trying to find people with whom he had extended contact. The CDC is trying to locate approximately 80 passengers and 27 crew members who were on the two transatlantic flights and may have been near the infected passenger, Cetron said. Passengers who are at highest risk on those flights were sitting within two rows of the man. They are urged to call 1-800-CDC INFO so they can receive a TB test to determine if they have been infected with the TB bacterium. The man was on Air France flight 385 from Atlanta to Paris on May 12 and on Czech Air flight 0104 from Prague to Montreal on May 24. On the Air France flight departing Atlanta, he sat in row 30, Skinner said. On the Czech Air flight he was sitting in 12C. CDC officials said Wednesday they have not yet received a passenger manifest from Air France, and that pinpointing the man's seat takes time. "This is a cumbersome and challenging process to locate passengers," Cetron said. The agency also released details of several short flights within Europe taken by the couple, but said that they were all of short duration and involved less risk. Cetron has said CDC would be involved in his transport to the Denver facility. "We're working on plan to insure the patient can move safely across state lines," he said.

May 31, 2007 12:49 PM | Just heard this moron is a personal injury attorney so he obviously knew the law and what he could and couldn't get away with. Forget suing him, just publicize his name and let him lose his client base. Must have been a nice honeymoon! I would have loved to hear the lies he told her about why they were running all over Europe like a Robert Ludlum spy novel. Any why isn't there an Executive Order from the White House requiring a passport to enter this country from Canada right now?

May 31, 2007 12:42 PM | hey everyone....why don't you go on he and his daddy's website and tell them what a self centered jerk he is? May 31, 2007 12:36 PM | Say what you will regarding the CDC and the authorities. However, these agencies advised this person of the severity of his illness and provided information regarding options and considerations regarding his health. His acts of continuing on with his original plans, endangering the health of others including his family and new bride were completely selfish. So plans for the trip and wedding would have to be altered and money would be lost. It happens unfortunately. Now his recovery must encompass even more extensive means than it would have if he had remained in the U.S. and started the process earlier. He clearly has no regard for authority and when requested to remain in Europe for immediate treatment, he runs like a fugative! His behavior demonstrates he is not as intelligent as he believes himself to be. May 31, 2007 12:35 PM | what a selfish jerk! why has he not been jailed like that Russian in the midwest? everyone who has had to take time off from work and get tested should send him a bill. May 31, 2007 12:31 PM | We humans have a bad habit of not altering our behavior, even when the doctor orders it, if we feel fine at that moment. I'm guessing that that was his mindset. TB is not an easy disease to catch, but if someone on those flights does test positive for that particular type of TB then of course they should have recourse to hiring a personal injury attorney and pursuing it in court, since they may themselves have to face quarantine. But he himself is a personal injury attorney so he'll understand I'm sure. I don't really see what criminal laws have been broken, unless you realllllyyyy stretch them..

Market intelligence group Impact RX said that Avandia&#039;s share of the market for newly prescribed oral anti-diabetics fell to around zero from around 10 percent in the two days after the article was published in The New England Journal of Medicine on May 21. At the same time, the rate of patients switching from one drug to another was three times the usual level. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.&#039;s rival drug Actos&#039; share of the new prescription market increased from 10 percent to 22 percent. "This reaction is far worse than we had anticipated and suggests that there could be as much as 22 percent downside risk to GSK&#039;s near-term earnings, suggesting that there is still further downside to GSK&#039;s share price," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note. Glaxo shares fell 2.1 percent to 1,306 pence (US$25.87; &#8364;19.20) on the London Stock Exchange. US economy grows by just 0.6 percent in the first quarter Wachovia buys A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion . Deutsche Telekom executive who once worked at Siemens to leave company The journal, citing a number of combined studies on the drug, reported last week that people using Avandia have a 43 percent greater risk of heart attack than patients using other diabetes drugs, or no medication. Glaxo said its own reviews showed the drug increased the risk of heart attack by 30 percent, and said it told the Food and Drug Administration about that last year. The British drugmaker added that it disagreed with the article&#039;s conclusions and questioned its methodology. The Avandia family of drugs, which includes combination treatments Avandamet and Avandaryl, last year posted sales of 1.6 billion pounds, making it GlaxoSmithKline&#039;s second best-selling drug after asthma treatment Advair.

Sinai: 'Third Wave' Of 9/11 Illnesses Appear Slideshow: The World Trade Center Remembered WCBSTV.com's 9/11 Special Report A new study has emerged that raises serious concerns about 9/11-related illnesses. For years, scientists reported that it was too soon to link cancers to the toxins that workers were exposed to at Ground Zero after 9/11. But new research is finding a link between Ground Zero toxins and certain types of cancers. They've already suffered from the World Trade Center cough and from chronic lung diseases. Now doctors say 9/11 responders could face debilitating blood cancers from breathing the toxic air. The first wave of illnesses was considered to be that stubborn, dry "World Trade Center cough," which was first noticed in the months following the attacks. The cough was likely caused by workers inhaling pulverized cement in the air while working downtown. The second wave largely involves chronic respiratory diseases that cause lung inflammation and scarring. The cancers are being called the third wave of sickness. Ironically, the latest findings could be welcome news for some Ground Zero workers. These newly released findings could help the case for a lawyer representing more than 100 workers, who claim they got cancer by working at Ground Zero. It shows the peeling away of denial -- first the air was safe, then it wasn't. They lied about it, said attorney David Worby, who represents 105 people who responded to the 9/11 attacks at Ground Zero, and got cancer. Worby is not surprised by the latest medical findings that establish a link between breathing the mix of toxic chemicals at Ground Zero and getting blood cancers. He just wonders what took doctors so long. The final layer to be peeled away is the fact that hundreds of people who spent thousand of hours at Ground Zero have cancer -- and many more will get it, he said. More than 100 of Worby's clients in a class action suit against the city have developed blood cancers. One of them is only 30 years old. Most range in age from 35 to 40. The new research linking blood cancers to Ground Zero was published in Thursdays New England Journal of Medicine, based on studies done by the World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program at Mount Sinai, which has been studying 20,000 responders. The concern is that those who worked at Ground Zero will be diagnosed with blood and lymphatic cancers because of their exposure to the air at "The Pit," which exposed them to asbestos, dioxin and other carcinogens. Dr. Robin Herbert, the co-director of Mount Sinai's World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program, described the latest findings in an online audio interview. "We know we have a handful of cases of multiple myeloma in very young individuals. And multiple myelomas usually present later in life. And that's the odd, unusual and troubling finding we're seeing already," Herbert said. More than 20,000 responders to the 9/11 World Trade Center attacks have been examined by doctors at Mount Sinai's World Trade Center Medical Monitoring Program Although some people already have cancer, what Herbert is worried about is the possibility of others developing cancer down the road.

Sign Up For WebMD Newsletters Tests & Tools A-Z Drugs & Treatments Home Diet & Weight Loss Diet & Weight Loss Parkinson's Disease Health Center Parkinson's Disease Health Center Pesticides: A Link to Parkinson's? Researchers Say Pesticide Exposure and Head Trauma Are Factors in Parkinson's Disease May 30, 2007 -- Boxing and agricultural work seemingly have little in common, but new research suggests both occupations are linked to an increased risk for Parkinson's disease. The findings add to the evidence implicating pesticide exposure and repeated head trauma as likely contributors to Parkinson's disease and related degenerative brain disorders. Farm workers and other study participants who reported high levels of pesticide exposure were found to have a 41% increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease compared with participants who reported no pesticide exposure. And having been knocked unconscious more than once was associated with a 2.5-fold increase in Parkinson's risk, compared with having never been knocked out. The findings suggest that at least some of the causes of Parkinson's disease and related disorders are modifiable, but more research is needed to better understand this association, researcher Finlay Dick, MD, of the Scotland's University of Aberdeen, tells WebMD. "One limitation of this study and most others is that people could not recall which pesticides they had been exposed to," he says. "So we weren't able to tease out which specific pesticides might be behind the effect we observed." Parkinson's disease is a progressive disease of the brain that affects balance and the body's ability to coordinate muscles and move. The European Commission-funded study included 959 patients with Parkinson's disease and closely linked neurological disorders and 1,989 people without any evidence of the degenerative disorder living in Scotland, Italy, Sweden, Romania, or Malta. All study participants completed a questionnaire designed to determine their lifetime occupational and recreational exposure to pesticides, chemical solvents, and the metals iron, copper, and manganese. Researchers also gathered information on family history of Parkinson's disease and history of head trauma leading to unconsciousness. Reported exposures to chemical solvents or the metals iron, copper, and manganese were not found to influence Parkinson's risk, but even minimal exposure to pesticides was associated with a small increase in risk. The findings were published May 30 in an online issue of the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine. The European study is not the first to link pesticide use to an increased risk for Parkinson's disease, or to suggest that risk increases as exposures increase. Earlier this year, researchers from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) also reported that lifetime exposure to pesticides was associated with an increased risk for the disease. Freya Kamel, PhD, who led that study team, is conducting related research designed to identify the specific pesticides associated with risk. She tells WebMD that she expects to publish findings from the study within a year or two. "We have some ideas about which pesticides or pesticide classes are involved, but this will be a more detailed look at the issue," she says. Muhammad Ali is at once the world's most famous living boxing legend and the world's most famous Parkinson's patient. His two-decade struggle with the disease has focused the spotlight on head trauma as a potential cause of the neurological disorder. While the European study suggests a link, it cannot show a causal association because it was not clear if the Parkinson's patients in the study suffered head trauma before or after their disease was diagnosed. If confirmed, the finding would have major implications for all contact sports, particularly boxing, Dick and colleagues wrote. National Parkinson Foundation medical director Michael S. Okun, MD, tells WebMD that the European study adds to the growing body of evidence linking specific environmental triggers to Parkinson's disease. But he adds that these triggers probably tell only part of the story. "It would be a mistake to assume that this is a disease linked directly to pesticides or linked directly to genes and to close the door on potential interactions between them," he notes in a written statement. "While the causes of Parkinson's aren't known, it is likely influenced by a combination of factors, such as a genetic predisposition for the disease, coupled with environmental triggers."

The WHO stated that major expansion in HIV testing was essential if the world was to beat the HIV/AIDS pandemic, one that has seen the death of 25 million people and counting. "This is radical in the sense that things have to change," WHO HIV/AIDS director Kevin De Cock stated. In sub-Saharan Africa, it is estimated that only 12% of men and 10% of women know their HIV status. "Across the world, people with HIV are flowing through healthcare settings, not being diagnosed and not being offered the advantages of knowing their status," stated De Cock. In the last 25 years, treatment for the virus has come a very long way, allowing people who are HIV positive today to live meaningful full lives, yet a full cure for the disease has yet to be found. According to the WHO less than 20% of residents of low and middle income countries know that they are actually HIV positive, a fact that makes it easier for the disease to spread. The WHO wants to see a situation where instead of people going and requesting an HIV test, that the service be made available for them to take advantage of so that it becomes a part of a normal trip to a health center.

Barack Obama, D-Ill., talks with Dr. Mark Anderson while touring a cardiology research lab before speaking about his health care plan, at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, May 29, 2007. Charlie Neibergall / AP Amidst all the hype over his meteoric rise to the top rungs of the Democratic Presidential field, Barack Obama has been especially criticized for running a campaign that is long on high-flown rhetoric and short on policy specifics. On Tuesday, in Iowa, he tried to address that potential weakness in a dramatic way. Taking on one of the nation's most urgent and politically fraught domestic challenges, Obama unveiled a detailed that he claims would come close to providing health coverage for the 45 million Americans who now lack it, while reducing health care costs of the typical American family by as much as $2,500 a year. The plan, which the Illinois Senator vowed to implement by the end of his first term in the White House, would cost the government an additional $50-$65 billion a year, which Obama said he would pay for by allowing President Bush's tax cuts for those making over $250,000 a year to expire. Startled by Obama's surge, Clinton is courting women and blacks, cozying up to fund raisers and deploying Bill First-term Senator Barack Obama has the charisma and the ambition to run for President. But, as Joe Klein reports from the campaign trail, he's not quite ready to answer the tough questions Obama's plan contains many of the features of the failed health care proposal pushed more than a decade ago by his rival, Hillary Clinton, that went down in flames in 1994, including its most controversial element: a legal mandate that employers provide coverage for their workers, or pay a percentage of their payroll into a fund for the uninsured. But he insisted that the political climate around the issue has changed dramatically since then, and that businesses are far more open to the idea. "Rising costs have caused many more businesses to back reform," he said in a speech at the University of Iowa Hospital in Iowa City, "and in states from Massachusetts to California, Democratic and Republican governors and legislatures have been way ahead of Washington in passing increasingly bolder intitiatives to cover the uninsured and cut costs." Obama also borrows from a major cost-cutting proposal that John Kerry put forward in his 2004 Presidential campaign, in which the government would pay part of the cost for covering catastrophic illnesses like cancer and heart disease that require the most expensive treatments and surgeries, which consume a disproportionate share of the nation's total health care tab. And as with a number of other reform proposals, including one by his Presidential rival John Edwards, Obama would set up a health insurance program similar to that now offered to federal employees, where the uninsured could pick among a group of plans, with subsidies provided to those who could not afford to buy in. But one idea that Obama rejected is a so-called "individual mandate," similar to that being tried in Massachusetts and proposed in California, where everyone would be required to buy health insurance, just as car owners are now required to carry auto insurance. In truth, Obama's plan could fall somewhat short of real "universal coverage." It would exempt the smallest businesses from the requirement that they cover their workers. (The exact size of the exemption has yet to be determined, but one campaign official said it would apply to businesses employing "some number less than 15.") And while it would require coverage of children, adults could choose not to take advantage of his plan and go uninsured, even if they could afford coverage. The Illinois Senator also promised that his plan would pour billions into upgrading medical record-keeping, make hospitals collect and publicly report measures of their own health care quality, and require more generous coverage of preventive care. He also said he would put new emphasis on personal responsibility in health care, although &#151; giving back some ammuniton to his critics &#151; he didn't specify how he would do it. "In the end," he said, "prevention only works if we take responsibility for our own health and make the right decisions in our own lives &#151; if we eat the right foods, and stay active, and listen to our wives when they tell us to stop smoking." That last reference drew a knowing chuckle from his audience, where many were familiar with Obama's own struggle to kick his nicotine habit. Elements of his plan are certain to draw opposition from the increasingly concentrated insurance industry. The most controversial would limit their profits in areas of the country where health insurance is provided by just a few carriers. "We'll investigate and prosecute the monopolization of the insurance industry," Obama said. "And where we do find places where insurance companies aren't competitive, we will make them pay a reasonable share of their profits on the patients they should be caring for in the first place." Strong words, but Obama may yet find out that, on that particular proposal, he is being too specific for his own good.

Researchers may have the answer: a dietary supplement containing a compound found in common foods like grapes, tea, cocoa, and blueberries, coupled with a little exercise. In a study conducted in mice, animals fed a diet enriched with the compound, known as epicatechin, showed signs of better brain functioning than mice that ate a typical diet. When the supplement was combined with regular exercise, the advantages went up significantly. The investigators believe epicatechin, which is a type of chemical known as flavonols, helps the brain work better by promoting blood vessel growth in a part of the brain responsible for learning and memory. It may also play a role in developing mature nerve cells. When epicatechin is combined with exercise, it also appears to favorably impact genes important in protecting learning and memory, and dampen down the effect of genes responsible for inflammatory and neurodegeneration. The researchers plan more studies to confirm the beneficial effects of epicatechin. "A logical next step will be to study the effects of epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals," study author Henriette van Praag, Ph.D., of the Salk Institute, was quoted as saying, "and then humans, combined with mild exercise." She and her fellow investigators write in the paper, "An active lifestyle combined with a flavonol-rich diet may prevent aging-related cognitive disorders and/or neurodegenerative disease."

The child died over the weekend of what's commonly referred to as blood poisoning after it was infected with serratia, harmful bacteria that can seriously harm infants. The tot weighed between one and three pounds. The hospital has sprung into action, conducting special hygiene measures - including increased hand sanitizing - aimed at wiping out the bacteria and controlling the infection. Officials say a second baby has been isolated after testing positive for the bacteria - fortunately that child isn't considered to be at grave risk. The hospital reopened its level 2 neonatal unit on Wednesday night, but its level 3 unit - home to the most vulnerable tiny patients - remained closed. Send to a Friend Baby Dies At Mt.

For example, people who suffer from sciatica, which is a condition in which a person's leg becomes numb or pain shoots down a leg that is pinched, 75% of cases will improve over time on their own without any sort of medical intervention. Studies indicate that each year, 1.5 million back surgeries are performed around the world to remove slipped discs to relieve pressure on a nerve. In the first study featuring 283 patients who had suffered with a back problem approximately 95% of participants reported that their condition improved within a year whether they underwent surgery or not. "Thus, for patients with persistent sciatica, there seems to be a reasonable choice between surgical and nonsurgical treatment, which may be influenced by aversion to surgical risks, the severity of symptoms, and willingness to wait for spontaneous healing," Richard Deyo of the University of Washington in Seattle said in an accompanying editorial. The second study looked at a condition in which the spine degenerates, forcing a spinal bone forward. The study proved that with this type of back condition, fusing the bones of the spine together proved to be more effective than non-surgical treatments. "Surgery patients did a lot better," said James Weinstein of Dartmouth Medical School. Click Here to Join the Discussion! at 2007-05-31 02:11 | Copyright Â© 2006 DogFlu.Ca All rights reserved.

Preliminary investigations by the country's health officials have suggested a potential link between the infections - caused by a parasitic amoeba - and use of a moisture-locking contact solution. But some experts believe that the outbreak simply signifies a larger problem with multipurpose contact solutions that simultaneously aim to disinfect and lubricate lenses. On 25 May, Advanced Medical Optics announced a of its Complete MoisturePlus contact solution. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a health advisory the same day tentatively linking this lens solution to the outbreak of keratitis - damage to the cornea cased by a toxin released by the parasite. About one quarter of the people with the infection require corneal transplants. The CDC said it had received reports of 138 recent cases of the infection across 35 states. Of this group, the agency had full clinical data for 46 patients, 39 of whom wore soft contact lenses. And of those who wore such lenses, 58% used Complete MoisturePlus contact solution. Still, Advanced Medical Optics stresses that there is currently no direct evidence showing the solution was contaminated with the In 2006, health officials connected the MoistureLoc contact solution made by Bausch & Lomb to a similar corneal infection called keratitis, caused by a fungus. Exactly how the solution contributed to this infection remains unclear, however. The reasons for the more recent keratitis outbreak has similarly puzzled experts. "I don't think there is a single consensus about the reason for the increased reporting of infections," says ophthalmologist Steven Verity at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas. He points out that the microbe is ubiquitous: "It's basically found everywhere. You can't run away from it." The waterborne parasite is present in tap water, hot tubs and lakes, for example. "We're exposed to this stuff all day, every day," explains Kathryn Colby of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston. Colby has treated four patients with keratitis in the past year, and says the number of such cases seems to be on the rise. There are few treatments for the infection, and doctors sometime must resort to applying baquacil - a swimming pool cleaner - to patients' eyes. Normally, a protective layer about six cells thick on the outside of the cornea prevents the parasite from establishing itself in the eye. Colby believes that the combination of newer, silicone hydrogel contact lenses, and lens solution that locks in moisture, might create a "perfect storm" that dismantles this protective layer outside the cornea. This, in turn, would make the eye susceptible to infection. There has been some suggestion that changes in chlorination of water supplies has increased the prevalence of , notes Dan Jones, chairman of ophthalmology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, US. But Jones agrees that some chemical component in the moisture-locking solutions probably plays a large role in promoting eye infection. According Jones, the US Food and Drug Administration "must step in" and "look critically at multipurpose contact lens solution". He suggests that it might be best to revert to using separate solutions to disinfect and lubricate contact lenses. Cornea specialists say that health officials should quickly address the recent outbreak of keratitis. "It's really a wake-up call that some current contact solutions are not doing the job," says Colby. Experts say that people should avoid "risky behaviours" such as swimming in lakes and rivers while wearing contact lenses. And even washing the face in tap water can be a cause of infection. People are also advised to change their eye solution every day, not merely top up the solution sitting in the lens cases. Colby also urges people to consider wearing disposable daily lenses instead of those that are replaced every month.

According to researchers from Europe, the risk of Parkinson's disease increases if a person is continuously exposed to pesticides. "Those who were heavily exposed to pesticides had a 41 percent increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease, and those with lower exposure had a 13 percent increased risk," said lead researcher Dr. Finlay Dick, from the Department of Environmental and Occupational Medicine at Aberdeen University Medical School, Aberdeen, U.K. The researchers also found that head trauma also increased a person's risk of developing Parkinson's disease. They found that even being knocked unconscious once could raise a person's risk by as much as 35 per cent. The National Parkinson Foundation estimates that 1.5 million Americans currently live with the degenerative brain disorder. "This study adds to a growing body of evidence that points toward an association between exposure to environmental issues being related to neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's disease," said Dr. Michael S. Okun, the medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation. Click Here to Join the Discussion! at 2007-05-30 17:37 | Copyright Â© 2006 DogFlu.Ca All rights reserved.

A priority review by the U.S. regulator, granted to medicines that represent a significant improvement compared with existing therapies, would have accelerated the approval and marketing of the vaccine in the key U.S. market. Instead, the drug will go through a standard 10-month review, and the company expects to get it to market in the U.S. sometime in 2008. GlaxoSmithKline applied in March for U.S. marketing approval of Cervarix, which targets cervical cancer and is expected to become a multibillion dollar product. It expects to launch the vaccine in Europe and several other markets in the second half of 2007. Earlier this month, it was approved by health regulators in Australia. At 0825 GMT, GlaxoSmithKline shares were down 16 pence, or 1.2%, at 1,312 pence in a broadly higher London market. The shares jumped Wednesday as the pharmaceutical company sought to defend its top-selling diabetes drug Avandia, the safety of which was questioned last week in a New England Journal of Medicine article. In a letter to U.K. medical journal The Lancet, GlaxoSmithKline's Chief Medical Officer Ronald Krall said that Avandia's side effects were comparable to those seen with two other widely used diabetes medicines, metformin and sulfonylurea. The critical report in the New England Journal of Medicine had triggered a slide in GlaxoSmithKline shares, sending them to their lowest level since April 2005 early in Wednesday's session.

The level of wellness or health is, in part, determined by the ability to deal with and defend against stress. Health is determined by physiological, psychological, socio-cultural, spiritual, and developmental stage variables. UK recommends Pfizer's Champix for Smokers Buy best Smoking products from Amazon Smoking :: UK recommends Pfizer's Champix for Smokers Pfizer Inc announced that the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom has recommended Champix (varenicline) for use on the National Health Service for adult smokers who have expressed a desire to quit. This gives smokers across England, Wales and Northern Ireland access to another important treatment option to help them quit smoking. In its Final Appraisal Determination, NICE concluded that varenicline was superior to NRT [nicotine replacement therapy] and bupropion in achieving continuous abstinence and that its use in smoking cessation was likely to be a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources. This guidance means that smokers who are serious about stopping have another choice from a good range of clinically proven treatments, said Professor Robert West, Professor of Health Psychology at University College London. Smokers who combine treatments with the right support  for instance from smoking cessation services - could significantly increase their odds of successfully quitting for life. Champix is the first new prescription aid to smoking cessation treatment in nearly a decade. Pfizer discovered and developed Champix specifically as an aid to smoking cessation through its unique mechanism of action targeting the specific receptor to which nicotine binds. Champix is believed to work by reducing the severity of the smokers urge to smoke. This guidance in the U.K. recognizes the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of Champix, and encourages physicians and smokers to consider this treatment as a new treatment option to help smokers quit smoking, said Jack Watters, MD, Pfizers Vice President of International Medical Affairs. The implications of this ruling are particularly timely as they come just before World No Tobacco Day, when organizations and governments around the world will work to implement smoke-free policies, which may further encourage smokers to make a quit attempt. Smoking, the leading cause of preventable de ath worldwide, is responsible for five million de aths worldwide each year. By 2010, the World Health Organization estimates the annual global cost of tobacco-related illness to be approximately US$500 billion. The medication, varenicline, with trade name Chantix (varenicline) in the United States, received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval as an aid to smoking cessation in May 2006. In the European Union, Champix received marketing authorization in September 2006 for use as a smoking cessation aid. For a patient prescribed Champix or Chantix, Pfizer also offers behavioral support, a personalized online interactive program to help smokers quit, at no extra cost. In clinical trials, varenicline was generally well tolerated with overall discontinuation rates similar to placebo. The most frequent side effects included nausea, headache, trouble sleeping and changes in dreaming.

Advanced Medical Optics, who is the maker of the recalled contact lens solution has stated that they currently do not know the reason for why their product has been linked to a rare eye condition that can leave a person blind According to the manufacturer of a contact lens solution that was recently recalled due to it causing a rare eye infection, they have yet to figure out what is actually wrong with their product. Advanced Medical Optics is the maker of the contact lens solution that has been found to be linked to a rare eye infection that in some cases can lead to a person going blind. Due to the current uncertainty following the recall, shares in the company's sstock have dramatically dropped, closing down 14% at $34.69 in the first day since news of the problem was made public on Friday. Doctors across the country have stated that they already have begun fielding many calls from patients who have been using the contact lens solution, and are worried that they might be exposed to the infection. âThe literature suggests that about half the patients will eventually need corneal transplants, compared to 30 percent for Fusarium,â said Dr. Robert Cykiert, an ophthalmologist at New York University Medical Center According to health authorities, the actual risk of infection after using the product is fairly low, and they recommend throwing away any of the Complete MoisturePlus if you have it.

Acanthamoeba is a microscopic, free-living ameba commonly found in the environment that can cause rare but severe illness. Acanthamoeba causes three main types of illness involving the eye (keratitis), the brain and spinal cord (Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis), and infections that can spread from an entry point to the entire body (disseminated disease). Where is Acanthamoeba found? Acanthamoeba is found worldwide. Most commonly, Acanthamoeba is found in the soil and dust, in fresh water sources such as lakes, rivers, and hot springs, in brackish water, and in sea water. Acanthamoeba can also be found in swimming pools, hot tubs, in drinking water systems (e.g., slime layers in pipes, taps), as well as heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems and humidifiers. How does infection with Acanthamoeba occur? Acanthamoeba keratitis infection has been associated with contact lens use, although people who do not use contact lenses can become infected. Contact lens wearers who practice proper lens care can develop infection. However, poor lens hygiene or wearing contact lenses during swimming, hot tub use, or showering might increase the risk of Acanthamoeba entering the eye and causing a serious infection. Acanthamoeba can also cause disseminated disease by entering the skin through a cut, wound, or through the nostrils. Once inside the body, amebas disperse via the bloodstream to other parts of the body, especially the lungs and brain and spinal cord. Can infection be spread from person to person? The spread of Acanthamoeba infection from one person to another has never been reported. What are the symptoms of Acanthamoeba infection? The symptoms of Acanthamoeba keratitis can be very similar to the symptoms of other more common eye infections. The symptoms, which can last several weeks to months, are not the same for everybody and might include: Sensation of something in the eye Eye infection with Acanthamoeba has never been known to cause infections in other parts of the body. Acanthamoeba can also cause skin lesions and/or disseminated disease. These infections usually occur in people with compromised immune systems. Acanthamoeba can cause a serious, most often deadly, infection of the brain and spinal cord called Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis (GAE). Once infected, a person may suffer with headaches, stiff neck, nausea and vomiting, tiredness, confusion, lack of attention to people and surroundings, loss of balance and bodily control, seizures, and hallucinations. Symptoms progress over several weeks and death usually occurs. Skin infections do not necessarily lead to disseminated disease. Who is at risk for infection with Acanthamoeba? Although infection is very rare, people who wear contact lenses are at increased risk for Acanthamoeba keratitis. Practices among contact lens users that increase the risk of getting Acanthamoeba keratitis include: Improper storage and handling of lenses Improper disinfection of lenses (such as using tap water or homemade solutions to clean the lenses) Swimming, using a hot tub, or showering while wearing lenses Coming into contact with contaminated water Having a history of trauma to the cornea Skin or disseminated disease caused by Acanthamoeba occurs more frequently in people with compromised immune systems or those who are chronically ill. Is there treatment for infection with Acanthamoeba? Yes. Eye and skin infections are generally treatable. If you suspect your eye or skin might be infected with Acanthamoeba, see your health care provider. Medical treatment is most effective when the diagnosis is made promptly. Most cases of brain and spinal cord infection with Acanthamoeba (Granulomatous Amebic Encephalitis) are fatal. How can I prevent infection? These guidelines should be followed by all contact lens users to help reduce the risk of eye infections, including Acanthamoeba keratitis: See your eye care professional for regular eye examinations. Wear and replace contact lenses according to the schedule prescribed by your eye care professional. Remove contact lenses before any activity involving contact with water, including showering, using a hot tub, or swimming. Wash hands with soap and water and dry before handling contact lenses. Clean contact lenses according to the manufacturer's guidelines and instructions from your eye care professional. Use fresh cleaning or disinfecting solution each time lenses are cleaned and stored. Never reuse or top off old solution. Never use saline solution and rewetting drops to disinfect lenses. Neither solution is an effective or approved disinfectant. Store reusable lenses in the proper storage case. Storage cases should be rinsed with sterile contact lens solution (never use tap water) and left open to dry after each use. Replace storage cases at least once every three months. Share this article on => &copy; 2004-2007 by foodconsumer.org unless otherwise specified &copy; Copyright 2004 - 2007

Mount Sinai Hospital's director of infection control Dr. Allison McGeer. T.O. neonatal unit shut after infection kills baby Updated Thu. May. 31 2007 9:06 AM ET The neonatal intensive care unit at a downtown Toronto hospital has been shut down after a premature baby died from a highly feared bacterial infection, according to a newspaper report. The infant died of bacteremia, commonly known as blood poisoning, at Mount Sinai Hospital, said the hospital's director of infection control Dr. Allison McGeer. She said the blood poisoning occurred after the baby acquired serratia, a harmful pathogen that can cause severe infections in babies. "This is one of the organisms we really worry about it," McGeer told The Globe and Mail. "... This is not an organism you take any chances with." The infant, weighing between one and three pounds, died over the weekend. "It is so awful for new parents, such a tragedy that these babies die," said McGeer. "It's also extremely hard on the staff who work in the unit because every one of those babies is their baby, too." A second baby also tested positive for serratia, which can lead to pneumonia, meningitis and bacteremia infections. The infant is in isolation at the hospital but is not seriously ill. The death has prompted the hospital to impose special infection control procedures, including improved hand hygiene and mandatory gowns and gloves in the neonatal intensive care unit. The hospital's level 3 neonatal unit remained closed Wednesday night but level 2 was reopened on Wednesday afternoon. The neonatal ward is currently operating at maximum capacity and the hospital has plans to expand the space in order to prevent sick infants from being in close proximity. To minimize infection, experts recommend incubators be placed at least 10 feet apart. The Mount Sinai incubators are currently placed four to five feet apart. According to Dick Zoutman, physician director of the Community and Hospital Infection Control Association of Canada, hospital-acquired infections are the fourth leading cause of death among patients. Zoutman told the newspaper between 8,000 and 12,000 Canadians die from hospital-acquired infections every year.

The prescription-only drug which costs the NHS £1.95 a day is more successful at helping heavy smokers abstain than nicotine patches. And yesterday the NHS health watchdog said the medication should be widely available from GPs from July to coincide with Englands smoking ban. The cost of a 56-day pack of tablets is £54.60. The recommended 12-week course of treatment costs about £163.80. The drug varenicline mimics the way that nicotine works in the brain. The pill, with the brand name Champix, provides the same satisfaction as a cigarette while at the same time blocking the route for nicotine so that smoking doesnt feel as good. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommends the drug be used in conjunction with counselling. varenicline appears to be a good way to help people who want to quit smoking A spokesperson for NICE But if health trusts cannot offer this additional support, it should still be prescribed by GPs, NICE said. An independent review of ­evidence published in January concluded that people taking the drug were up to three times more likely to give up than those given bupropion, or Zyban, an anti-depressant used by smokers. Smoking is a notoriously hard habit to kick. Only three per cent who try to quit are smoke-free a year later. This means the drug could help one in 10 smokers to successfully quit for more than a year. Yesterday, a leading expert on smoking and addiction applauded the decision. SEARCH NEWS / SHOWBIZ for: Professor Robert West, of the University College London, said: This guidance means that smokers who are serious about stopping have another choice from a good range of clinically proven treatments. Smokers who combine treatments with the right support could significantly increase their odds of successfully quitting for life. One in four people in Britain smoke despite the fact it triggers cancer and other lung diseases and is the leading cause of preventable premature death. Half of long-term smokers will die early as a result of smoking and a quarter of these will die in middle age. Yesterday a spokes-person for NICE said: Having looked at all the evidence, our independent committee has concluded that varenicline appears to be a good way to help people who want to quit smoking. The draft guidance also recommends that varenicline should normally be provided in conjunction with counselling and support, but if such support is not available, this should not stop smokers receiving treatment with varenicline. Varenicline is the first new anti-smoking treatment to be developed in a decade. It was approved for use in the UK last October and is already prescribed on the NHS to more than 15,000 patients. However, the new NICE approval will mean that it now has to be offered to all patients regardless of where they live in the UK and whether their trust can afford it. The drug is based on the leaves of the Cytisus laburnum which has been used as a tobacco substitute since the Second World War. Smoking costs the NHS more than £1.5billion a year. Despite great advances in the treatment of most other cancers, lung cancer survival rates have remained static for decades. This is because tumours are hard to detect and by the time cancer is diagnosed, it is often too late to operate. Got A Story? Get in touch online Email the news desk directly here!

Unless immediate and effective tobacco control measures are implemented, we will face a public health catastrophe in not too distant a future. The government, on its part, was among the first countries to sign WHOs Framework Convention for Tobacco Control and also ratified it with a comprehensive law  The Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply and Distribution) Act, 2003. Health is a State Subject and local bodies are not only empowered, but are also responsible for taking measures required to protect citizens health. The BMC has launched a campaign to clean up Mumbai. To this, we must add measures to ban smoking in public places. Ireland was the first country to ban smoking - it came into effect March 2004 - in workplaces, pubs, restaurants etc. Norway, New Zealand and Italy followed in its footsteps. Since then a number of cities and provinces in the US, Canada, Europe and Australia have enacted smoke-free laws, New York, Los Angeles and Shanghai are already smoke-free. Chandigarh is the first Indian city to officially ban smoking. As regarding compliance, several restaurant owners have said that they would enforce a no smoking rule and that a law would be a most useful tool. The Tata Memorial Hospital proposes, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai (MCGM) and the Action Council against Tobacco - India will launch a Tobacco-Smoke Free Mumbai Campaign. Mumbai will also host the 14th World Conference on Tobacco or Health in February 2009 and it would be the best time to present Mumbai as an attractive and progressive city that is worth visiting, living in and investing in.

Champix, described as the most effective treatment yet to help people quit, was cleared after trials showed almost half of those who took it managed to give up. The draft approval comes just weeks before England goes smoke-free on July 1, when there will be a ban on smoking in virtually all enclosed work and public places. The prescription only twice-daily pill received approval from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), which advises the NHS on which drugs it should supply. Champix tablets contain the active ingredient varenicline, which is a medicine used to help people who are addicted to nicotine to give up smoking. It works by providing relief from cravings and the withdrawal symptoms experienced by smokers. It also reduces the satisfaction a smoker will get from further cigarettes if they have a relapse. Trials have shown the drug was effective after a 12-week course, with 44 per cent of smokers managing to stop. A spokeswoman for Nice said: "Having looked at all the evidence, our independent committee have concluded that varenicline appears to be a good way to help people who want to quit smoking. "The draft guidance also recommends that varenicline should normally be provided in conjunction with counselling and support, but if such support is not available, this should not stop smokers receiving treatment with varenicline. "Nice follows an open and transparent process which includes genuine consultation so changes in draft recommendations can occur. "Stakeholders now have the opportunity to appeal against the draft guidance. Subject to any appeal, final guidance is expected to be issued to the NHS in July 2007."

According to Glaxo, the safety of their drug is comparible to that of other diabetes drugs, mainly metformin. Since the news hit that taking avandia put one at an increased risk of a heart attack, shares in the second largest drug maker in the world fell more than 9 percent. Glaxo Chief Medical Officer Ronald Krall said in a letter that studies in progress will provide more information on safety pertaining to avandia. Shares in the company have risen slightly, up 1.7% since the company called the study into question. ``Although these findings seem scientifically questionable to us and are unlikely to support near-term product withdrawal or major litigation, we believe that share price risks are nonetheless skewed to the downside,'' Merrill Lynch analysts wrote. Prescriptions of avandia have also fallen off the wagon following the findings of the study being made public, while rival drug prescriptions have soared.

Under the guidelines, unveiled Wednesday by the World Health Organization and UNAIDS, healthcare providers everywhere who treat patients at high risk of HIV are advised to suggest testing. But in countries facing a widespread epidemic, they advise doctors to recommend tests for all patients anywhere they seek healthcare. Organizations fighting AIDS celebrated the guidelines as a step toward identifying the estimated 31 million out of the 39.5 million people living with the disease worldwide who are unaware they are infected. But human rights concerns clouded the announcement. "We think these new guidelines are extremely important," said Kevin De Cock, director of HIV and AIDS programs at the WHO. As we struggle to move toward universal access to testing, treatment and support, HIV diagnosis is an important first step," he told reporters on a conference call. People who do not know they have HIV do not receive life-prolonging treatment and counseling to prevent them from spreading the disease to others, De Cock said. When doctors recommend testing, patients are more likely to find out their status. The catch is that in some countries there have been reports of mandatory testing, breaches of confidentiality and discrimination. If friends and neighbors are informed a patient has HIV, the person could be shunned. If an employer is given that information, the person could be fired. In those countries, De Cock said, the guidelines call for strong monitoring and enforcement to make sure testing helps people instead of hurting them. Some human rights organizations, however, are concerned that a wide-scale rollout of testing programs will not take discrimination into account. "The guidelines are helpful in the sense that countries around the world have been looking to the WHO for guidance," Joe Amon, director of the HIV/AIDS program at Human Rights Watch, told United Press International. But "we already know in some countries HIV testing is done without good protections." Violations "happening today are real concerns." Human Rights Watch reports document human rights violations involving testing in countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. Because of the definition of epidemic, the guidelines tell about 50 countries to recommend testing to all patients, Amon said. Those countries will need to be committed to protecting the rights of HIV patients. Existing resources need to be mobilized to carefully watch testing, and major campaigns should be launched to persuade the public to help people with HIV, instead of hurting them with discrimination, he said. "More people have to know their status, but just knowing isn't enough." But other advocates say the critical need for testing outweighs other concerns. "The worst discrimination people with HIV and AIDS face is premature death because of lack of treatment," said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, a U.S.-based group that provides treatment for the disease domestically and around the world. One billion people per year need testing, and that will never be possible unless it is incorporated into the general healthcare system, he told UPI. The group practices routine testing at centers in the United States, Uganda and other countries, and that has dramatically increased the testing rate. "If we knew every infected person today and counseled them not to infect their partners, we would achieve global AIDS control relatively quickly, Weinstein said. "A majority of people with HIV and AIDS in the world don't know. You cannot combat AIDS on a global basis without early detection." &copy; Copyright 2007 United Press International, Inc.

Bad diets based on fatty and sweet ingredients combined with physical laziness account for six of the seven top factors leading to bad health, said EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou. For years the EU Commission has warned governments to act - but the situation is getting worse. "Everybody has to be blamed - including the authorities, including the industry, including the consumers," Kyprianou said. His biggest worry is the increasing girth of children.

"The numbers are frightening," said EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou. According to Kyprianou, bad diets and lack of exercise, account for 6 of the 7 factors that lead to bad health. "Everybody has to be blamed â including the authorities, including the industry, including the consumers," he added. Kyprianou states that European kids are becoming more and more overweight, a fact that does not bode well for the future. "If we don't act, today's overweight children will be tomorrow's heart attack victims," he said. It is estimated that 21 million European children are either overweight or obese. "Even more worrying is that the rate of increase of that number is more than 400,000 children a year. Now the biggest problem of obesity is in the Southern member states who have abandoned the Mediterranean diet and go for same kind of nutrition of fast food as elsewhere," Kyprianou said. Being overweight or obese significantly increases one's risk of a number of diseases ranging from diabetes to heart disease, thus having a large percentage of children dealing with obesity is not a good indicator of the future.

Tests have shown the anti-smoking agent varenicline to be the most effective treatment yet to help smokers quit. The government drugs advisory agency, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), said in draft guidance that varenicline, sold as Champix, offers a cheaper and more effective option than existing treatments. But some groups have criticised Nice's draft approval, pointing out that it has recently turned down other treatments for cancer and Alzheimer's. Tests for varenicline show that smokers who use it can triple their likelihood of successfully kicking the habit, compared with trying to quit without medication. The pill, taken twice a day, also outstrips other anti-smoking agents such as bupropion, Nice analysis showed. A spokesman for Nice said: "Having looked at all the evidence, our independent committee have concluded that varenicline appears to be a good way to help people who want to quit smoking." He added that the prescription-only drug, which costs 54.60 pounds per pack, should be provided in conjunction with counselling and support. The drug partially stimulates nicotine receptors in the brain, which helps reduce nicotine withdrawal symptoms. It also partially blocks nicotine from attaching to these receptors, making smoking less satisfying and so curbing a person's desire to smoke. &copy; Reuters 2007.

The Salk Institute study could lead to further tests to see if epicatechin also works on humans. The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggests it improves blood flow in the brain - especially in combination with extra exercise. However, nutritionists warn chocolate is high in fat and sugar, which may undo any potential benefits. We'd obviously recommend a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, with perhaps a small amount of chocolate - but eating five bars a day is likely to just make you fatter, without any noticeable improvement in memory Spokesman, British Nutrition Foundation This is not the first study to find a link between 'flavanol' chemicals in certain foods and health benefits - other studies claim that cardiovascular health can be improved by including them in the diet. The researchers, led by Dr Henriette van Praag, working with chocolate firm Mars, compared mice fed a typical diet with those fed a diet supplemented with epicatechin. Half the mice in each group were allowed to run on a wheel for two hours each day and then, a month later, were trained to find a platform hidden in a pool of water. Those that both exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice. The epicatechin-fed mice who did not exercise also showed enhanced memory, but to a lesser degree. The mice on the special diet appeared to have greater blood vessel growth in certain parts of their brain, alongside more mature brain nerve cells. Chocolate is another source Dr van Praag said: "A logical next step will be to study the effects of epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals - and then humans, combined with mild exercise." Dr Mark Mattson, from the US National Institute on Ageing, said: "This is an important advance because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory-enhancing effects, suggesting it may be possible to optimise brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation." However, a spokesman for the British Nutrition Foundation said that while there was some evidence that diets rich in flavanols could be beneficial in humans, often when flavanols such as epicatechin were given on their own, no benefits could be spotted. She added: "We'd obviously recommend a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, with perhaps a small amount of chocolate - but eating five bars a day is likely to just make you fatter, without any noticeable improvement in memory."

POSTED: 3:42 pm EDT May 28, 2007 UPDATED: 3:55 pm EDT May 28, 2007 Applying sunscreen to your body isn't the only way to protect yourself from skin cancer. Some dermatologists say you can also drink your way to healthy skin. Drinking just one cup of tea a day can lower your risk of getting the two most common types of skin cancer, squamous and basal cell carcinoma, reported the Journal of the American Academy Of Dermatology. In a study of more than 2,000 people, tea's antioxidants were found to limit the effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays. It doesn't matter if the tea is hot or cold, and all types of tea offered protection. But doctors warn that tea isn't the cure-all. Remember to cover up and wear sunscreen. . All rights reserved.

Pesticides 'increase risk of Parkinson's' Paris - Exposure to pesticides, even in small amounts, can lead to an increase in Parkinson's disease, according to a recently published scientific study. Research on nearly 1 000 Parkinson's sufferers in five countries showed that high-level exposure upped the risk of contracting the debilitating brain disease by 39%. Lower-level exposure, consistent with hobby-gardening use of pesticides, corresponded with a 9% increase, said Finlay Dick, the lead author of the study, published yesterday in the British journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine. Parkinson's is an incurable, degenerative disease of the central nervous system that causes uncontrollable shaking, along with impaired speech. In about one third of cases, it also results in dementia. Estimates of its prevalence vary between 0,1% and 0,3% of the population, said Dick. - Sapa-AFP n VODKA ESPRESSOServes 1 Chinese warned of bad effects of smoking Carbs are worse for the blood than fats Pesticides 'increase risk of Parkinson's' Expo to showcase thrilling options for the great outdoors Browse by page &raquo; Chinese warned of bad effects of smoking Carbs are worse for the blood than fats Pesticides 'increase risk of Parkinson's' Car Insurance for Women Play Euro & UK Lotteries USA Green Card Program Win Now For Real IOL on your phone IOL on your phone &copy; 2007 Star & Independent Online (Pty) Ltd.

The compound, epicatechin, is one of a group of chemicals known as flavonols and has been shown previously to improve cardiovascular function in people and increase blood flow in the brain. Flavonols are found in some chocolate. Henriette van Praag, of the Salk Institute, and colleagues both at Salk and Mars Inc. showed that the combination of exercise and a diet with epicatechin also promoted structural and functional changes in the dentate gyrus, a part of the brain involved in the formation of learning and memory. The findings, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggest that a diet rich in flavonols may help reduce the incidence or severity of neurodegenerative disease or cognitive disorders related to aging. The researchers found that sedentary mice fed epicatechin showed enhanced memory, blood vessel growth and gene activity, but these benefits were even more evident in mice that also exercised.

The victims, who are gay, attended private gay sex parties in Groningen, a city in the northern Netherlands close to the German border. Police received the first complaints about the parties - notorious for unsafe sex - already in June 2006 and immediately published warnings to all potential visitors. The police were alarmed by a sudden sharp rise in HIV infections, which they said was related to the sex parties. The police say the victims had been sedated with the party drug GHB (Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate) and received injections of HIV-infected blood by the four suspects. Police found large quantities of GHB on the four suspects. In February 2007 the first victim filed a report with the police. The suspects were arrested in early May. Used in low doses, GHB is popular in dance clubs. In higher dosages, it can cause unconsciousness. GHB is often used during sexual assaults because it renders the victim incapable of resisting and may cause memory problems that could complicate prosecution. - Sapa-dpa News24 is now available on your cellphone. -- Top stories in this category -- Rice drops Russia speech &#39;Brutal&#39; cops caught on tape &#39;UK involved in spy&#39;s poisoning&#39; Sinn Fein joins policing board

A Georgia man suffering from a dangerous form of tuberculosis will be treated at Denver's National Jewish Hospital, which specializes in respiratory disorders, a hospital spokesman said Wednesday. The man is under a U.S. government-ordered quarantine in an Atlanta hospital because the bacteria is so dangerous. (AP Photo/Ed Andrieski) By MIKE STOBBE AP Medical Writer ATLANTA May 31, 2007 (AP) Health officials in North America and Europe sought passenger lists Wednesday for two trans-Atlantic airline flights in their effort to find about 80 people who sat near a honeymooner infected with a dangerous drug-resistant form of tuberculosis. Authorities also disclosed that the man was on several flights between various European locales over the course of two weeks earlier this month. Passengers lists for those flights were also being tracked down, they said. "The investigation is just beginning. It's very challenging," said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's division of global migration and quarantine. The man, who is under the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963, told a newspaper he flew from Atlanta to Greece for a wedding and then traveled to Italy for a honeymoon. Later he flew back to North America because he feared he might die without treatment in the United States. CDC officials are concentrating on the trans-Atlantic flights, when the likelihood of spreading the disease was greatest because he was in a confined space with other people for hours. Officials were trying to contact 27 crew members and about 80 passengers who sat in the five rows surrounding the man for testing. Other passengers on the flights are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in the man was low, Cetron said. "Our big concern is that no one has told us which row he might have sat on," passenger Shannon Boccard, whose 10-year-old son was on the same flight, told WSB-TV in Atlanta. Health officials in France have asked Air France-KLM for passenger lists, and the Italian Health Ministry also is tracing the man's movements. A spokeswoman for Czech airline CSA said medical checks showed no infections among its crew members who flew with the man, but the airline was contacting passengers. The man had a supply of masks to wear for the protection of other passengers, but it is not clear whether he donned them, Cetron said. The man continues to feel well and shows no symptoms, Cetron said. CDC Seeks Those Who Sat Near TB Patient Read 2 Comments and Post Your Own WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

Champix, which has been given draft approval for NHS prescription by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), also reduces the satisfaction that smokers will get from a cigarette if they have a relapse." /> NHS pill will curb smoker&rsquo;s craving &#150; and satisfaction from a cigarette-Life & Style-Health-TimesOnline Our exclusive four-step guide to giving up before the ban Navigation - link to other main sections from here How Whitehall can learn from Tesco and John Lewis NHS pill will curb smoker&rsquo;s craving &#150; and satisfaction from a cigarette Nigel Hawkes, Health Editor Smokers who want to give up will be able to cut their nicotine cravings with a new pill provided free by the NHS. Champix, which has been given draft approval for NHS prescription by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice), also reduces the satisfaction that smokers will get from a cigarette if they have a relapse. Trials have shown that, after 12 weeks of taking the pill twice daily, 44 per cent of would-be quitters had not smoked, compared with 18 per cent of those taking a placebo and 30 per cent who took another antismoking drug, Zyban, also known as bupropion. The draft approval was issued less than five weeks before a ban comes into force on smoking in all enclosed public areas and workplaces in England. The drug is likely to be given full approval within the next two months. Nice found that Champix, also known as varenicline tartrate, was &ldquo;superior to nicotine replacement therapy and bupropion in achieving continuous abstinence&rdquo; and that it was likely to be a cost-effective use of NHS resources. The recommended 12-week course of treatment costs about &pound;163.80, but people can take the pill for longer if recommended by their doctor. Most existing pills, patches and gum work by supplying the body with a steady stream of nicotine after the user has stopped smoking. The idea is to allow the cravings to diminish. Zyban has a different action. It is an antidepressant that lessens the desire to smoke again. Champix, different again, aims to reduce the intensity of the cravings by binding to the nicotine receptors in the brain and interfering with the release of the &ldquo;pleasure&rdquo; chemical dopamine. This also reduces the severity of the craving and other withdrawal symptoms. The most common side-effect of the drug is nausea, which is generally mild and transient, and fewer than 3 per cent of smokers stopped the treatment because of this. Smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in Britain &mdash; with about 114,000 deaths annually attributed to the habit &mdash; and costs the NHS about &pound;1.5 billion a year. A spokeswoman for Nice said: &ldquo;Having looked at all the evidence, our independent committee concluded that varenicline appears to be a good way to help people who want to quit smoking. &ldquo;The draft guidance also recommends that varenicline should normally be provided in conjunction with counselling and support, but if such support is not available, this should not stop smokers receiving treatment with varenicline.&rdquo; David Gillen, medical director of Pfizer, which makes Champix, said: &ldquo;The health, social and economic impacts of smoking in the UK are immense. With smoke-free England just around the corner, more people than ever before are attempting to quit. &ldquo;Yet for many smokers, willpower alone is not enough. Now they have access to another treatment on the NHS to help them succeed.&rdquo; recommended course of 12 weeks costs more than &pound;160 Success rate: 44% a two-month course of this antidepressant costs &pound;1.33 a day, or a total of about &pound;80 Success rate: 30% a one-off session costs anywhere between &pound;100 and &pound;250 Claimed success rate: 95% a course of up to ten sessions costs from &pound;125 to at least &pound;250 Claimed success rate: 24% a five-week course can cost from &pound;16 to &pound;20 a week. Success rate: 15% replacement therapies such as patches and chewing gum are also available through the NHS and pharmacies. A two-week course is available for one prescription charge of &pound;6.85, if applicable. a gel rubbed into the skin. It costs &pound;9.99 for a bottle, equivalent to 50 cigarettes Success rate: not known I totally agree with your percentage chances of giving up with the different methods.

Photograph: PA How many smokers are there in the UK? There are estimated to be around 12 million smokers in the UK. This includes 10 million smokers in England, 1.1 million in Scotland, 600,000 in Wales and 330,000 in Northern Ireland. Why should people quit smoking? Smoking is the biggest cause of death and illness in the UK. More than 120,000 people in the UK die each year from smoking-related causes. Smoking is a major contributor to many serious diseases, including heart disease and lung cancer. Tobacco contains poisons such as nicotine, ammonia, acetone, carbon monoxide, cyanide and arsenic. Cigarettes often contain more than 4,000 chemicals. Giving up smoking increases the chances of living a longer and healthier life. Smokers who quit before the age of 45 have a life expectancy close to that of people who have never smoked. A 1994 report in the British Medical Journal found that every year people continue smoking after the age of 35-40 reduces life expectancy by three months. After quitting smoking, people are at reduced risk of smoking-related diseases. They also find they have clearer skin, whiter teeth and an improved sense of smell and taste. What are the side effects of quitting? Most smokers experience a range of unpleasant withdrawal symptoms when trying to quit. In the short term (within 24 hours), these include depressed mood, difficulty in sleeping, irritability and anger, anxiety, restlessness, decreased heart rate, dizziness and increased appetite. How many people manage to quit? Seven out of 10 smokers say they want to quit. In a given year, around half of all smokers make at least one attempt to quit. But only 2-3% succeed in the long term. What are the main treatments to help people quit? The main treatment is nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). This works by getting nicotine into the body without the tar, carbon monoxide and other poisonous chemicals you get from cigarette smoke. It is available as patches, chewing gum, lozenges and tablets, which are placed under the tongue, as well as an inhaler or nasal spray. The drug bupropion, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline under the brand name Zyban, works by interfering with the chemicals in the brain that cause addiction. Some patients take it together with NRT. A new drug called varenicline, marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Champix, has received draft approval for use on the NHS. If the pill receives full approval in July, it should be available on the NHS later this year. Counselling and support are also used to encourage people to stop smoking. These are often used in tandem with either NRT or a drug prescription. The NHS runs stop-smoking groups where people trying to quit can get peer support. Individual counselling is also available. There is a telephone helpline called QUIT, while hypnotherapy is also marketed as a way to stop smoking. How successful are treatments to help people quit? Clinical trials have shown that a 12-week course of NRT will help in 5-10% of attempts to quit smoking. There is no evidence that one form of NRT is more effective than another. Trials have found that a course of Zyban (usually prescribed for eight weeks) helps in about 10% of attempts to quit. A course of Champix (usually prescribed for 12 weeks) helps in just over 14% of attempts to quit, with a further course helping another 5% to stop. NHS stop-smoking groups and individual counselling help in about 5% of attempts to quit, but most of these patients also use either NRT or drugs.

And women with moderately elevated blood pressure -- a condition known as pre-hypertension -- also showed reductions in their blood pressure after eight weeks of eating soy nuts, Dr. Francine K. Welty of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and her colleagues found. "We know that people in the pre-hypertension group are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease," Welty told Reuters Health in an interview. "This would provide a dietary treatment that could safely lower blood pressures in that pre-hypertensive range." She pointed out that while studies are still underway to determine if people with pre-hypertension should take drugs to lower their blood pressure. Welty and her team recruited 60 postmenopausal women, 12 of whom had hypertension, to begin the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, which involves cutting fat, cholesterol, sodium and calories. Each study participant spent eight weeks on the TLC diet alone and eight weeks on the TLC diet plus a half-cup of dry-roasted, unsalted soy nuts daily. While eating the soy nuts, the women subtracted the equivalent amount of protein from other sources so their protein consumption remained constant. The researchers chose soy nuts, Welty noted, because they are among the least processed sources of soy available, and are more convenient and portable than either soy milk or tofu. Hypertensive women in the soy nut-group had a drop in systolic blood pressure (the top number of the blood pressure reading) of 9.9 percent, and a drop in diastolic blood pressure (the lower number) of 6.8 percent. Among those with pre-hypertension (systolic blood pressures between 120 mmHg and 139 mmHg), the soy nuts decreased systolic blood pressure by 5.5 percent and diastolic blood pressure by 2.7 percent. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Explain to interested patients that there are few treatments for advanced renal cell carcinoma and they are of limited efficacy and considerable toxicity, especially in cases where the tumor burden is extensive. Note that this study found that a new drug, temsirolimus, prolongs survival and is better tolerated than a standard treatment, interferon alfa, in patients with metastatic disease. And in a rare confluence of research results and regulatory action, on the same day that the pivotal randomized trial was published in the New England Journal of Medicine the drug was approved by the FDA for the indication. For patients getting the drug, median survival was 3.6 months longer than for those getting standard treatment with interferon alfa, Gary Hudes, M.D., of the Fox Chase Cancer Center, and colleagues in the Global ARCC Trial, reported in the May 31 issue of the A third arm of the industry-sponsored study, combining temsirolimus and interferon alfa, did not show any survival benefit over interferon alfa alone, Dr. Hudes and colleagues found. "This is the first study to show that a new drug can improve overall survival for patients with metastatic renal cell cancer," Dr. Hudes said. Early last year, sutinib (Sutent) was approved to treat metastatic renal cell carcinoma, but the studies involving that drug showed improvement in progression-free survival, rather than overall survival. Similarly, sorafenib (Nexavar) was approved in December 2005 on the basis of a delay in disease progression in renal cell carcinoma. While the survival improvement with temsirolimus therapy is "modest," Dr. Hudes said, patients in the study had very advanced tumors. "It would be reasonable to hypothesize that temsirolimus could provide greater benefit to patients with less extensive metastatic disease," Dr. Hudes said. The current study was stopped at the second interim analysis, the researchers said, when 446 of the 626 patients had died and there was significant evidence (at In the study, patients were randomized to 25 mg of temsirolimus intravenously once a week; to interferon alfa, at a dose escalating from three million to 18 million units, subcutaneously three times a week; or to a combination of 15 mg of temsirolimus weekly and six million units of interferon alfa three times a week. Median survival for patients getting temsirolimus was 10.9 months, compared with 7.3 months for interferon alfa and 8.4 months for the combination. For temsirolimus patients, the hazard ratio for death, compared to interferon alfa, was 0.73 (with a 95% confidence interval from 0.58 to 0.92), which was significant at Overall survival for patients in the combination group did not differ significantly from those getting interferon alfa. Dr. Hudes and colleagues said the lack of efficacy in the combination group may have been a result of the lower dose of temsirolimus. The study also showed a significantly longer period of progression-free survival ( Temsirolimus was better tolerated than interferon-alfa, with 67% of patients in the temsirolimus group having Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, compared with 78% of interferon patients and 87% of patients in the combination group. Both differences were significant at The study was supported by Wyeth Research, which is developing temsirolimus. Dr. Hudes reported financial links to Pfizer Pharmaceuticals and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals. Other authors reported financial links to industrial concerns including Wyeth, Novartis, Chiron, Bayer, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Pfizer, and Genentech. Three of the authors, Timothy O'Toole, Stephanie Lustgarten, and Laurence Moore, M.D., Ph.D., are full-time employees of Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.

http://www.spiritindia.com/health-care-news-articles-9854.html&cid COX Inhibitors May Weaken Protective Qualities of Estrogen Hormone Therapy COX Inhibitors May Weaken Protective Qualities of Estrogen Hormone Therapy Menopause, also known as the Change of life or climacteric, is a stage of the human female reproductive cycle that occurs as the ovaries stop producing estrogen, causing the reproductive system to gradually shut down. A clinical diagnosis that is based on the permanent cessation of menses. COX Inhibitors May Weaken Protective Qualities of Estrogen Hormone Therapy Buy best Menopause products from Amazon Menopause :: COX Inhibitors May Weaken Protective Qualities of Estrogen Hormone Therapy Researchers from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine found in a database study of women heart patients that COX inhibitors such as traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may undermine any purported protection against heart disease in participants taking estrogen therapy. The results were described this week in PLoS Medicine. Premenopausal women are less susceptible to heart attack and stroke than are males of the same age group, an advantage that is lost after menopause. However, why this happens physiologically is unclear. Despite the cardiovascular advantage of premenopausal women, it has been difficult to identify a cardioprotective effect of taking estrogen in postmenopausal women. The Penn research group recently found in mice that estrogen acts via COX-2dependent prostacyclin, a fat that has a role in limiting blood clotting. Estrogen in this animal model acts via prostacyclin to decrease clotting and oxidative stress in cells and to limit hardening of the arteries. We were prompted to perform these studies while exploring the mechanism by which NSAIDs confer a cardiovascular hazard, that is suppression of COX-2 derived prostacyclin says lead author Garret FitzGerald, MD, Director of the Institute for Translational Medicine and Therapeutics at Penn. Inhibition of COX-2 by NSAIDs prevents production of prostacyclin. However, as estrogen acts to increase production of prostacyclin, the researchers surmise that the possible positive effects of estrogen therapy on the cardiovascular system may be counteracted by the COX-inhibiting NSAIDs. To ascertain whether the failure to detect a benefit from estrogen might be partly attributable to a pharmacological interaction between inhibitors of COX-2 and estrogen, the researchers examined the medical records of 1,673 women between 50 and 84 from the United Kingdoms General Practice Research Database who had heart attacks or who died from coronary heart disease and compared them with 7,005 control participants. The researchers found that use of estrogen replacement therapy was associated with a significantly lower risk of heart attack than non-use. However, in women who used NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen, which inhibit COX-1 and COX-2, at the same time as hormone replacement therapy, this protective effect was lost. Whether taking estrogen actually confers cardioprotection remains controversial. It seems likely that benefit is conferred only on women who commence estrogen close to the time of menopause; such women were the object of this study, explain the researchers. If estrogen is started some years after the onset of menopause it may actually confer risk itself. These provocative observations should not be regarded as a basis for clinical decisions, says FitzGerald. However, they are mechanistically plausible and should stimulate further research." This work was performed in collaboration with Luis Alberto Garcia Rodriguez, from the Centro Espanol de Investigacion Farmacoepidemiologica (Madrid), and was partially funded by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. Karine Egan, Penn, was also a co-author. PENN Medicine is a $2.9 billion enterprise dedicated to the related missions of medical education, biomedical research, and high-quality patient care.

Research for the NHS Smokefree campaign found that 20% of smokers felt new laws will help them stop. England goes smokefree on July 1, when smoking will be banned in virtually all enclosed work and public places. Thursday&#039;s poll comes after the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) issued draft guidance - subject to appeal - in support of a new pill on the NHS. Varenicline (brand name Champix) was given the thumbs-up after trials showed almost half of those who took it managed to give up. Liz Martin, NHS Smoking Helpline specialist adviser, said: "The smokefree legislation is just a month away and there is help available in England for those smokers thinking about stopping. "Local Stop Smoking Services can offer group support or one to one and can help quitters get patches, gum or other stop smoking aids on prescription." She said smokers were up to four times more likely to stop if they had such support.

It is the most common type of kidney cancer in adults. Initial therapy is with surgery. It is notoriously resistant to radiation therapy and chemotherapy, although some cases respond to immunotherapy. FDA approves new drug for advanced kidney cancer Buy best Kidney Cancer products from Amazon Kidney Cancer :: FDA approves new drug for advanced kidney cancer The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) today approved Torisel (temsirolimus) for the treatment of a certain type of advanced kidney cancer known as renal cell carcinoma. Torisel was approved based on a study that showed use of the drug prolonged survival of patients with renal cell carcinoma. The drug is an enzyme inhibitor, a protein that regulates cell production, cell growth and cell survival. "We have made significant advances in the battle against kidney cancer, said Steven Galson, M.D., M.P.H., director of the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. "Torisel is the third drug approved for this indication in the past 18 months, and one that shows an increased time in survival for some patients." The approval of Torisel follows the December 2005 approval of Nexavar (sorafenib), which was based on a delay in progression of disease. In January 2006, Sutent (sunitinib) received accelerated approval based on durable response rate, or tumor size reduction, and was later demonstrated to delay tumor progression. The safety and effectiveness of Torisel were shown in a clinical trial of 626 patients divided into three groups. One group received Torisel alone, another received a comparison drug called Interferon alfa, and a third received a combination of Torisel and interferon. The group of patients who received Torisel alone showed a significant improvement in overall survival. The median overall survival was 10.9 months for patients on Torisel alone versus 7.3 months for those treated with the interferon alone. Progression-free survival (when the disease does not get worse) increased from 3.1 months on the interferon alone arm to 5.5 months on the Torisel alone arm. The combination of Torisel and interferon did not result in a significant increase in overall survival when compared with interferon alone. The most common adverse reactions, occurring in at least 30 percent of Torisel-treated patients, were rash, fatigue, mouth sores, nausea, edema, and loss of appetite. The most common laboratory abnormalities were high blood sugar, elevated blood lipids and triglycerides, elevated liver and kidney blood tests, and low red cell, white cell, and platelet counts. Renal cell carcinoma, diagnosed in about 51,000 people annually in the United States, accounts for about 85 percent of all U.S. adult kidney cancer. Torisel is manufactured by Philadelphia-based Wyeth Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, gives ''us more confidence in recommending surgery to our patients," said Dr. Mark J. Spoonamore of the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine. The condition, called degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis, occurs when one lumbar vertebra in the back slips forward, pinching the spinal cord and producing severe pain in the legs. The condition affects as many as 600,000 Americans, although only about half of those seek medical treatment and perhaps only a quarter of them now undergo surgery, according to Dr. James W. Weinstein of the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, N.H. Women are six times as likely as men to suffer from it. Conventional treatment involves physical therapy, steroids to reduce swelling and anti-inflammatory drugs. But only about 20 percent of patients get better and 20 percent stay the same without surgery, according to Dr. Arya Shamie of the University of California Los Angeles' Geffen School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study. The federally funded study included 601 patients at 13 medical centers in 11 states. Of those, 372 underwent surgery and 235 did not. Two years after enrolling in the study, the 235 patients who did not undergo surgery reported only modest improvements. The 372 who had surgery reported significantly reduced pain and improved function.

DeNoon For two specific kinds of back and leg pain, back surgery offers the fastest relief &#8212; but those who choose nonsurgical treatments get better, too. Two separate studies reported in this week's New England Journal of Medicine show that surgery is the fastest route to pain relief for two very different conditions: severe sciatica and degenerative spondylolisthesis. But the studies also show that these conditions do not worsen if surgery is delayed &#8212; and that nonsurgical treatments can relieve at least some of the pain. An editorial titled "Back Surgery: Who Needs It?" accompanies the studies. Editorialist and back pain researcher Richard A. Deyo, MD, MPH, is professor of medicine and director of the center for cost and outcomes research at the University of Washington in Seattle. "The people who truly need back surgery are those who need it to preserve their ability to function," Deyo tells WebMD. "But short of that, most back surgery is an elective procedure. It is not urgent. Patients face real choices that are quite reasonable: either surgical or no surgery." Study: Slouching Better for Back Than Sitting Up Straight Back Surgery No Better Than Therapy for Herniated Disks Sciatica: Surgery vs. No Surgery Sciatica is pain or tingling that begins in the back or buttocks and runs down the leg. The most common cause is a bulging disk in the spine. The bulge presses against a nerve root, causing problems all along the nerves that branch from that root. Surgical treatment of sciatica relieves pressure on the nerve root by removing a portion of the affected spinal disk. But sciatica often gets better over time. Is surgery really the best choice? How long should a patient wait before opting for surgery? To answer these questions, neurosurgeon Wilco C. Peul, MD, head of the spine intervention study group at Leiden University Medical Center in the Netherlands, led a study of 283 patients with confirmed cases of severe sciatica. All of these patients' symptoms had lasted for six to 12 weeks. Even with pain medication, they could barely walk and were not able to work around the house or at their normal jobs. Half the patients underwent early surgery, most within two weeks of study entry. The other patients were assigned to "conservative treatment," which included pain management and physical therapy. As expected, early surgery meant quicker recovery. But Peul and colleagues were surprised by what happened in the conservative-treatment group. "The most important result is that what we did not expect &#8212; that in the conservative-treatment group, most of them also had a quick recovery," Peul tells WebMD. "It was slower than the early-surgery group. And 39 percent had longer-lasting leg pain and needed surgery. But at one year, the results for the two groups are nearly equal. Even at three and six months, the outcomes were not that much different." Patients whose surgery was delayed got just as good results as those who had surgery right away. "So for leg pain, if you cannot cope with the pain, there is a quite good reason to have surgery early," Peul says. "But if you can stand the leg pain and have enough medication and cortisone shots, you can postpone and even evade surgery. And patients have to be informed that whether surgery is done now or later, they will have the same outcomes." Current recommendations are for patients to wait six weeks to see whether their sciatica gets better. "I think we should wait at least two extra months to see if the patient is recovering. If not, or if the pain is worsening, surgery should be done early if the patient is asking for it," Peul says. "If the patient can sustain the pain, waiting is the best strategy. But if the patient very badly wants to do it, early surgery is a good choice." Surgery does not always work. Peul says that one in 20 patients with severe sciatica has continued pain even after back surgery. Spondylolisthesis: Surgery vs. No Surgery Degenerative spondylolisthesis sounds bad &#8212; and it can, indeed, be a very painful condition. It's a disease of aging, occurring six times more often in women than in men and affects black women in particular. The condition occurs when one of the vertebrae in the lower spine slips forward across another. This may cause spinal stenosis &#8212; a narrowing of the spinal canal that causes bone and soft tissue to press against a nerve. The result is pain in the buttocks or legs while walking or standing. Surgery involves laminectomy, an operation that removes part of the spinal bone to relieve the pressure on the nerve. The procedure often includes fusing the affected vertebrae with a bone graft. Patients tend to be elderly, so surgery carries a risk. Is the risk worth it? The answer is a qualified "yes," find James N. Weinstein, DO, of Dartmouth Medical School in Lebanon, N.H., and colleagues. Weinstein and colleagues report the two-year outcomes for more than 600 patients with at least 12 weeks of symptoms from degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis. Patients who underwent surgery had better symptom relief and better daily function starting six weeks after the operation and persisting for at least two years. But that doesn't mean surgery is for every patient. "In this study, we see a greater benefit to surgical than nonsurgical treatment," Weinstein tells WebMD. "But what has never been shown before is the nonoperation patients do get better. So now there is a basis for giving patients an informed choice about treatment options for this condition." Weinstein says that patients with spondylolisthesis should know that back surgery is very likely to relieve their pain. But they should also know that it won't bring them all the way back to normal levels of function. And it's also important for them to know that if they don't want to undergo surgery, they can still expect significant recovery. So what should patients do? "Go to a doctor who will share this information with you, who can understand your preferences, and help you make the choice that is best for you," Weinstein says. "This study shows surgery works a little better than nonsurgical treatment. But there are patients who choose not to have surgery. And that is a good choice, too."

Edwards Chances of Fed Rate Cut Diminish Glaxo Letter Defends Avandia PLC defended Avandia in a letter published on the Lancet medical journal's Web site, pointing to three studies to argue that the diabetes drug is safe for the heart. Ronald Krall, chief medical officer, wrote in the letter that Glaxo did a "meta analysis" similar to the one conducted by Cleveland Clinic cardiologist Steven Nissen, whose article in the New England Journal of Medicine last week linked the drug to a potentially increased risk of heart attacks. Glaxo's own meta-analysis also found indications of increased risk, Dr. Krall wrote, but he said the number of adverse events was low. Dr. Krall also discussed results from two large Glaxo-funded studies of the drug. Neither trial, called Dream and Adopt, was designed primarily to assess the drug's heart risks. But Glaxo's analysis of the Adopt trial showed major adverse cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes, were "rare," and heart risks were similar to those of two other diabetes drugs. The Dream trial also showed "no significant difference" in cardiovascular events between the drug and placebo, the letter said. Meanwhile, an independent safety board recently reviewed an interim analysis of an ongoing study, Record, designed specifically to assess the drug's impact on the heart. The board determined the trial should continue, the Glaxo letter said. In an interview, Christopher Viehbacher, Glaxo's president of U.S. pharmaceuticals, said the trial's interim results were "giving us the confidence to say that we stand behind this product." He said there is a chance the interim results will become public before the Record trial is complete, though the trade-off would be that the publicity could weaken the statistical power of the final results. Mr. Viehbacher said it wouldn't surprise the company if the Food and Drug Administration were to call for "some labeling changes" for Avandia. One possibility would be elevating a heart-failure warning on the label to a more severe "black box" warning, he said. Dr. Nissen criticized Glaxo's letter to the Lancet, saying the company was slicing the data differently from the Adopt and Dream results originally published. Dr. Nissen also said the company was referring to such small subsets of data in the Adopt and Dream trials, that no firm conclusion could be drawn. "Somebody went back and looked for something that would support their contention," Dr. Nissen said. "This is not a scientifically proper way to analyze data." Mr. Viehbacher said that after Dr. Nissen's article was published last week, "we were shouting in a gale-force wind blowing against us." Now, he said, the public-relations situation was improving.

Eduoard H.R. Gluck / Bloomberg News / Landov For contact lens wearers, the story has become a familiar one: a contact lens solution is yanked from the market amid reports of potentially debilitating disease. This time around, the product is Complete MoisturePlus, manufactured by Advanced Medical Optics (AMO), on news from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that the multi-purpose solution is linked to a rare but serious eye infection that can severely corrode the cornea and even lead to blindness. The recall is the latest in a string that has kept contact wearers wondering what solution is safe to use. Just a year ago, Bausch & Lomb was the company in the hot seat after the CDC released data on a different kind of eye infection that showed a disproportionate number of people suffering from the disease had been using the company's ReNu with MoistureLoc. The company issued a massive recall and discontinued the solution worldwide. Since then, there has been a handful of less-widespread recalls, set off by issues ranging from bacterial contamination in a Chinese plant to the detection of trace amounts of iron that could cause lens cleaner to lose its effectiveness. The narrative of the Complete MoisturePlus recall, announced on May 25, closely echoes what happened last year with ReNu MoistureLoc, although the microbes involved were different. In each case, local clinicians first noticed an uptick in a rare eye condition and reported the spike to the CDC, which launched an investigation and subsequently found that many people with the disease reported using the same contact solution. The disease involved in last year's ReNu MoistureLoc recall was the fungal infection keratitis. The disease associated with the Complete MoisturePlus recall is caused by , a water-borne parasite that occurs naturally but in the human eye can lead to serious infections of the cornea. The CDC interviewed 46 people who had the condition, called keratitis, and found that 21 of them reported using Complete MoisturePlus &#151; amounting to a risk seven times greater for people using the product than those who weren't. At this point, it isn't clear why that correlation exists. Or what lessons might be drawn from the similarity of this year's recall with last year's. "We're not prepared to make any generalizations at the moment," says CDC medical epidemiologist Dr. Sharon Roy, "but it does bring up questions about multi-purpose solutions." One of those questions, says cornea specialist Dr. William Ehlers, is whether multi-purpose solutions, standard products for soft contact lens wearers, are as effective as earlier peroxide-based cleaners. In fact, some studies show that peroxide-based cleaners, which involve a two-step cleaning process and bubbling action to remove dirt and build-up, are better at killing certain types of organisms. But they are also more cumbersome to use than multi-purpose solution, which simply involves a rinse. "Manufacturers have wanted to produce solutions that are convenient and comfortable, but it may be a trade-off to a certain extent between convenience and efficacy," says Dr. Ehlers, an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut Health Center. Does that mean that consumers should go back to older types of cleaners? Dr. Ehlers says: "People ought to be having this conversation with their eye-care professional." Another factor in last year's case that may resurface in this newest warning is how people misuse contact lenses and solution. Reusing or topping off old solution is a classic way to encourage infection. No-nos such as rinsing the inside of a contact case with water instead of solution, or showering or swimming while wearing lenses, may prove to be linked to the Complete MoisturePlus recall, since the parasite involved is water-borne. But the CDC's Roy is careful to point out that the investigation is still in its early stages, and little is known so far beyond the initial link. In the meantime, for the decision-averse, at least there's one less solution on the shelf to choose from.

The test of 626 volunteers with the kidney cancer compared the drug, also known as Torisel, with standard treatment using interferon alfa, along with a combination of both medicines. The combination turned out to be no better than interferon alfa alone. Average survival times were 7.3 months with interferon alfa and 8.4 months with the combination, which is not a significant difference. But with temsirolimus alone, the median survival time was 10.9 months. The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The Food and Drug Administration made it the third such therapy approved since late 2005 for renal-cell carcinoma, the most common form of kidney cancer. In December 2005, the FDA cleared Bayer's Nexavar, or sorafenib. In January 2006, Pfizer Inc.'s Sutent, or sunitinib, also won approval. Nearly 39,000 people are diagnosed in the United States with renal-cell carcinoma each year. Once the tumor has spread -- as it does in about one third of the patients -- there is usually no cure. &copy; Reuters 2007.

The Children, Youth and Tobacco: Causes, Consequences and Action conference examined smokings long-term health consequences and coincided with the first day of the Government ban on the sale of 10-pack cigarettes. Exercise patterns in young smokers and non-smokers were compared and discussed while the dangers associated with smoking during pregnancy were also highlighted. Our research shows that non-smoking young people are significantly fitter than those who smoke, Dublin City Universitys Dr Catherine Woods said. Our findings in relation to participation in athletics reinforce this message. Male non-athletes were 58% more likely to smoke than athletic counterparts, while female non-athletes were 43% more likely to smoke than their athletic peers, she said. The conference was chaired by Dr Fenton Howell, Director of Public Health at the Health Service Executive and included twelve expert speakers who travelled from Edinburgh, London, Washington and throughout Ireland to attend the event. Professor Luke Clancy, Director General of the Research Institute for a Tobacco Free Society explained exposure to cigarette smoke for some children begins in the womb. The consequences range from the possibility of stillbirth, to low birth weight, premature delivery, increased risk of serious health problems during the newborn period and may lead to lifelong disabilities, he said. Clearly, smoking cessation aimed at pregnant women should be increased. When exposure continues after birth, the results are also serious, including increased incidence of lower respiratory tract illness such as bronchitis, pneumonia, increased ear infections and a very significant increase in SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome). There is also an increased risk of developing asthma, which is a very common and important disease in children. Maurice Mulcahy, Principal Environmental Health Officer with the HSE based in Galway warned many smoking parents may be unwittingly exposing their children to second-hand smoke. Many conscientious smoking parents dont smoke while a child is in the same room as them. However, many have a cigarette when their children are out of the way, such as when they have gone to bed, he said. Adults need to be aware that smoke migrates from one room to the next and can, in fact, affect their children. We conducted an experiment recently and we established that it took 18 seconds for smoke to get from one room to the next  18 feet away  after the door was opened. The answer for parents who want to protect their children is clear  either quit smoking or smoke outdoors. A ban on the sale of packs of 10 cigarettes came into effect from midnight last night, although there will be a period of grace for retailers to get rid of stocks. The Office of Tobacco Control (OTC) said it hopes the measure will discourage young people from smoking.

Surgery may benefit those with back pain: studies Updated Wed. May. 30 2007 8:53 AM ET Slipped disks and sciatica -- two of the most common causes of back problems -- can see more improvement with prompt surgery than with non-surgical remedies, two new studies in the New England Journal of Medicine One study looked at 283 patients with sciatica, a painful condition caused by displaced spinal disks putting pressure on the sciatic nerve, causing painful burning sensations or numbness. The condition resolves itself on its own without surgery about 75 per cent of the time. The patients underwent randomization either to early surgery (microdiskectomy) or to treatment of physical therapy and drugs, using surgery only if needed. Thirty-nine per cent of the 142 patients who were referred for conservative treatment had surgery after an average of 18.7 weeks. At a one-year follow-up, 95 per cent of all sciatica patients were free of pain whether they had surgery or not. There were no significant differences between the groups in pain, disability, and recovery scores. But the early-surgery group experienced quicker pain relief and a faster rate of self-perceived recovery. The second study looked at cases of slipped vertebra or slipped disk -- called degenerative spondylolisthesis with spinal stenosis -- a condition in which one or more vertebra become misaligned and press on nerves in the spinal cord, resulting in leg pains. It generally occurs after the age of 50 and is seen six times more often in women than in men. The study, led by researchers at the Dartmouth Medical School, Lebanon, New Hampshire, found that surgery was twice as effective as non-surgical approaches in reducing pain and restoring functionality for patients. The study recruited 607 patients from 11 U.S. states who had at least 12 weeks of symptoms confirmed as DS. They were assigned to either a randomized cohort or an observational cohort. The results showed that 372 patients had surgery within two years (decompressive laminectomy, with or without fusion) and 235 had non-surgical treatments that included physical therapy, steroid injections, and pain relievers. Two years later, patients who had received surgical treatment reported significantly reduced pain and improved functionality as early as six weeks after intervention. Those who did not receive surgery reported only modest improvements. Although the study was designed to look at a randomized and an observational cohort, fully 40 per cent of participants who had been randomized later switched groups, resulting in substantial crossover between surgical and non-surgical groups. The authors chose to publish the results based on what treatment was actually received in each group. An accompanying editorial concludes: "Absent major neurologic deficits, patients with herniated disks, degenerative spondylolisthesis, or spinal stenosis do not need surgery, but the appropriate surgical procedures may provide valuable pain relief. "In such situations, decisions should be made jointly by well-informed patients and their physicians."

The work, which is published in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, was carried out under the Fifth Framework Programme (FP5) Geoparkinson project, which aimed to investigate how genetic and environmental factors interact to cause Parkinson's disease and related conditions. The researchers interviewed almost 1,000 patients with Parkinson's or related disorders from Italy, Malta, Scotland, Sweden and Romania. Participants were quizzed on their lifetime exposure to pesticides, solvents, iron, copper and manganese, as well as their experiences of being knocked unconscious and any family history of Parkinson's. The researchers also interviewed 2,000 people without Parkinson's, and compared their responses to those of the group with Parkinson's. They found that people who had been exposed to low levels of pesticides were 1.09 times more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than those who had never been exposed, while people who had been exposed to high levels of pesticides were 1.39 times more likely to be affected. 'This has implications for occupational and, perhaps, recreational users of these agents,' the researchers comment. 'Further research is needed to establish which pesticides are associated with this effect. The study also revealed an association between head injury and Parkinson's, with people who had been knocked out once being 1.28 times more likely to develop Parkinson's than people who had never been knocked out. Furthermore, people who had been knocked out frequently were found to be 2.56 times more likely to develop the condition. 'This finding, if confirmed, has implications for all contact sports and, in particular, combat sports such as boxing,' the researchers write. Meanwhile the study did not throw up any evidence linking solvent exposure or metal exposure to Parkinson's disease. The study did however confirm that the strongest risk factor was having a close family relative with the disease, although the scientists stress that whether this is due to a shared environment or genetic predisposition is unclear. 'This study has provided important evidence of the increased risk of Parkinson's disease in relation to exposure to pesticides,' the scientists conclude. 'The exposure-response relationship suggests that pesticide exposure may be a causative and potentially modifiable risk factor.'

The letter ``clarifies the safety record of Avandia,&#39;&#39; Glaxo said today in a statement. Glaxo shares have dropped about 9.3 percent, wiping out almost 7.88 billion pounds ($15.6 billion) in market value, since a May 21 report in the New England Journal of Medicine said that patients taking Avandia, the company&#39;s second-best-selling drug, were 43 percent more likely to have a heart attack. Glaxo Chief Medical Officer Ronald Krall said in the letter today that studies in progress will provide more information on safety. ``The drug use and approval system is working,&#39;&#39; Krall wrote. ``We should stay the course and allow ongoing trials to provide their definitive answers.&#39;&#39; The stock rose 22 pence, or 1.7 percent, to 1,328 pence in London. Earlier today, the shares had declined as much as 2.8 percent after analysts at Merrill Lynch & Co., the world&#39;s biggest brokerage, recommended investors sell the stock because of the reported heart risks. ``Although these findings seem scientifically questionable to us and are unlikely to support near-term product withdrawal or major litigation, we believe that share price risks are nonetheless skewed to the downside,&#39;&#39; Merrill Lynch analysts, including Graham Parry, wrote today in a research note. Avandia&#39;s share of new oral diabetes prescriptions fell to about zero from 10 percent in the two days after publication of the New England Journal article, Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a research note yesterday, citing data from market research firm Impact Rx. Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.&#39;s diabetes drug Actos&#39; share climbed to 22 percent from 10 percent, the analysts wrote. Takeda shares reached a two-month high today after the Deutsche Bank report. The stock gained 90 yen, or 1.1 percent, to 8,020 yen on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. ImpactRx disagrees with Deutsche Bank&#39;s interpretation of its data, the market research firm said yesterday in a PR Newswire press release. ``We believe insufficient time has elapsed since publication and it&#39;s premature to conclude any dramatic or lasting changes in physician prescribing behavior at this point,&#39;&#39; Impact Rx President and Chief Executive Officer Richard Altus said in the statement. Analysts have expected new Avandia prescriptions to decline since last week. Some doctors who treat diabetes report they are considering treatment alternatives for newly diagnosed patients. ``I don&#39;t think people will be pulled off drugs because of it,&#39;&#39; Rury Holman, professor of diabetic medicine and director of the Diabetes Trials Unit at Oxford University, who has done clinical trials for Glaxo, said in a telephone interview today. ``I think you will see new starts will go down.&#39;&#39; To contact the reporter on this story: Andrea Gerlin in London Last Updated: May 30, 2007 12:56 EDT Related Media on Demand Steven Nissen Sees Concern For Glaxo&#39;s Avandia Drug FTSE 100 Stocks Advance, Led by Johnson Matthey, HBOS, BHP Billiton Shares Altadis Default Swaps Fall on Speculation of New Bid From Imperial Tobacco Man Group Reports 27 Percent Jump in Full-Year Profit as Assets Increase

In a new drive against obesity, EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said he wanted to "encourage" food companies to provide consumers with full information about the health risks associated with their products. But if they failed to improve the information available to consumers, he said "we cannot exclude the possibility" of setting tougher advertising and labelling rules on companies. "What consumers eat is up to them, but they should be able to make informed choices, and have a range of healthy options to choose from," said Kyprianou. "That is why the Commission is reviewing the options for nutrition labelling, and calling on industry to advertise responsibly and reduce levels of salt, fats and sugar in food products," he added. The European Commission's new anti-obesity push is a response to growing evidence that Europeans, including a rising number of children, are too fat with over half estimated to be obese or overweight. According to the World Health Organisation, obesity rates have more than trebled since the 1980s in many European countries as the average daily intake of calories has risen. Of particular concern, was the growing prevalence of obesity among children, with over 21 million classified as obese across Europe. "We have to acknowledge the fact that children don't entertain themselves any more through physical activity," said Kyprianou, adding that they needed to be "reintroduced" to physical games.

Fertility issues are believed to affect one in seven couples in the United States, including Alba and Julio Garcia. A year passed and I started getting like, âsomethingâs wrong here,â Alba exclaimed. They tried to get pregnant for a whole year, but now couples can find out if they have fertility problems in a matter of minutes, with a new at home fertility screening test - the first to look at both a man and a womanâs fertility. Fertellâs kit includes a female test that can actually find a problem, detecting a hormone level measuring egg production. Itâs conducted much like an at home pregnancy test and can be read in 30 minutes. âThe test that we do in our office - thatâs actually in this kit - itâs the first test we look for when a woman comes for an evaluation. The male test in the kit - with results available in 80 minutes - measures the concentration of moving sperm, a key indicator of sperm health,â explained Dr. Harry Fisch, with the Columbia University Medical Center. But the couples test wonât catch every fertility problem. This test is not a guarantee that youâre fertile or not, but itâs a great start. The Garcias finally sought help from a fertility specialist and now they have a brand new baby girl, but for them this test would have been a godsend. âIt wouldâve saved me a year of not knowing we had a problem,â Alba explained. Fertell is now available in the United States on the web and at select pharmacies.

He requested $30 billion through the President's Emergency Programme for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) for the first five years after he leaves office. The President first announced his plans to create PEPFAR, a five year, $15 billion dollar initiative to combat AIDS worldwide, during his 2003 State of the Union Address. PEPFAR funding supports various HIV/AIDS programmes, which provide access to antiretroviral drugs, treatment, and prevention in fifteen focus countries, in addition to many other countries hard hit by the AIDS pandemic. The programme is currently set to expire on September 30, 2008. "Twenty-six years after the first reported AIDS case in the U.S., HIV and AIDS continues to devastate communities both at home and abroad, and our nation's leadership must harness all possible resources to confront the epidemic," said gay lobby group Human Rights Campaign President Joe Solmonese. "Though the PEPFAR programme has provided life-saving treatment for millions of people with HIV/AIDS worldwide, we continue to have grave concerns over the misguided restrictions on prevention funding. "Our nation's experts agree that the abstinence earmark only exacerbates the challenges in providing effective and culturally appropriate prevention messages to stem the transmission of the epidemic. "We urge Congress to lift these restrictions based purely on ideology and instead fund proven science-based prevention strategies." Current US law dictates that one-third of prevention funding through PEPFAR must teach exclusively abstinence-only until marriage. A 2006 report from the General Accountability Office (GAO) found that seventeen of the twenty countries surveyed reported that the abstinence earmark "challenges their ability to develop interventions that are responsive to local epidemiology and social norms." Furthermore, the GAO reported that in order to comply with the abstinence earmark, many countries were forced to significantly cut funding for prevention efforts to reach those most at risk, including programmes designed to prevent mother-to-child transmission of the HIV virus. In 2007, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) likewise criticised the abstinence earmark as well as the programme's ban on funding needle exchange programs as obstacles to the programme's effectiveness. Representatives Barbara Lee (Democrat, California) and Christopher Shays (Republican, Connecticut) have introduced the Protection Against Transmission of HIV for Women and Youth Act of 2007 which would eliminate the abstinence-only earmark in PEPFAR. © 2007.

Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation today announced a $105 million grant to launch an institute at the University of Washington that experts say will strengthen Seattle's growing reputation in global health research. The grant to create the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation is the single largest gift to the UW. The university is contributing an additional $20 million. Combined, the money is earmarked to launch and operate the institute for 10 years. The institute will be run by Chris Murray, a Harvard professor and global health leader who's been recruited for the job. The institute will evaluate international health programs and spending. UW President Mark Emmert said Monday the institute's work will get underway soon in existing UW facilities, but that there are no immediate plans for a new building. The new institute has a web site: The institute will be guided by an international board of health experts chaired by Dr. Julio Frenk, Mexico's former minister of health and a senior fellow at the Gates Foundation. Murray seemed almost destined to tackle world health problems: As a boy, when others his age were learning to ride bikes and fish, he was traveling across Africa with his parents as they set up health clinics and ran hospitals. "It was pretty captivating," Murray, 44, said in a recent interview. "I never really thought much about careers, but I always knew I'd do something in global health." He would later win a Rhodes scholarship, graduate magna cum laude from Harvard University with a medical degree and become a top official at the World Health Organization. News of the institute, due to open in the fall, first surfaced in February when UW regents discussed draft plans for the project. The university is expected to put in some money for the institute, but most will come from the Gates Foundation. The institute was to have been at Harvard, but software mogul Larry Ellison last year rescinded a promised gift of $115 million, citing leadership concerns after the departure of former Harvard President Lawrence Summers. Murray said he plans to bring several junior researchers with him from Harvard and other universities, and he hopes to recruit other talent from around the world. The institute will focus on research and will not offer undergraduate degrees, he said, although it will offer a master's degree program for 25 to 40 students. Murray officially became a UW employee May 1 and will be paid $420,000 in his first year, making him one of the UW's &#8212; and the state's &#8212; highest-paid employees. He grew up in the rural New Zealand town of Matamata, later immortalized as the setting for Hobbiton in "The Lord of the Rings" movie trilogy. He went to high school in Minnesota after his parents, a doctor and a microbiologist, moved there to work at the Mayo Clinic. His work defies simple explanation. One way to think about it, he said, is to compare the health-care world to the business world. In business, everyone knows exactly how much money is invested in a company, how much its products sell for and how much profit results, Murray said. "We can't imagine doing business without it. But when you turn to health care, we don't have it," Murray said. "When people in business cheat and break the rules, like with Enron, there's an extraordinary scandal. Yet we don't know what we get for all these large investments in health care." That lack of accountability prompted Murray and colleague Alan Lopez in the early 1990s to develop a measure for the global "burden of disease" &#8212; a systematic, numeric way to quantify health problems in terms of deaths, life years lost and years compromised by illness. Lopez, who now heads the public-health school at the University of Queensland in Australia, recalls how Murray and he developed much of the model while working out of an unheated barn in Maine. "For a period of 12 months, it was absolute hell," Lopez said. "We were doing something that had never been done before: measuring the health of the world. He had no doubt we could do it, while I had every doubt we could ever do it." The pair came up with 50,000 separate measures of health, Lopez said. But their work wasn't warmly received. One key measure they developed &#8212; called Disability Affected Life Years, or DALY &#8212; was derided by public-health leaders at the time, who accused the pair of making unethical judgments and comparisons about disease and suffering. "We called them the DALY wars. The public-health community railed against Chris in particular," Lopez said. "It was a very tumultuous period of four to six years." But Lopez said one person who took a shine to the work was Bill Gates, who began carrying the pair's summary book with him everywhere. Whenever someone would ask him for money, according to Lopez, Gates would quiz them about their "burden of disease" measurement. Eventually, the wider public-health community &#8212; and the World Health Organization &#8212; also came to embrace the measure, now seen as an important yardstick in health-care accountability. Murray said his research turned up some surprising results about problems in the developing world. While people had previously focused on illnesses such as malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis, Murray said they found three problems were being largely ignored: mental health, traffic injuries and heart disease/diabetes. Those findings helped shift people's perceptions &#8212; and their resources. "It had a reasonably significant effect on what's on the policy agenda," Murray said. Colleagues of Murray describe him as hard-working, focused and possessing an uncanny ability to unearth meaning from obscure data. In an e-mail, Harvard School of Public Health Dean Barry Bloom said Murray is "one of those rare academics who've really changed the world." "He's a phenomenon," Lopez said. "He's an extraordinary intellect and a driver in global health." Copyright &#169; 2007 The Seattle Times Company More local news headlines...

VP of Finance (non-profit) RX FOR HEALTH CARE Act would provide universal health coverage Published: Monday, June 4, 2007 magine guaranteed, high-quality health insurance for every American, coverage that can never be lost or taken away. Imagine a health care system focused on wellness and prevention. Imagine that insurance companies are required to cover everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions, and that you can't be dropped and your rates can't be raised if you get sick. Imagine your health insurance is as good as every member of Congress gets. Those are the bedrock principles underlying the Healthy Americans Act, the first bipartisan health care reform bill in more than a decade. The last time federal policymakers attempted comprehensive health care reform, in 1994, we saw what happened without a bipartisan coalition pushing for reform: Business groups said we can't afford it, and the effort quickly died. Today, many businesses are saying we can't afford to do health care reform. That change - combined with continual grass-roots efforts such as the ones we've seen in Oregon - has opened a window for real reform. The question is: Now that we have this window of opportunity, what should our health care system look like? Folks in Oregon, in particular, have put forward worthy proposals. The 100 Percent Access Coalition in Lane County, former Gov. John Kitzhaber's Archimedes Movement, the Oregon Business Council Health Care Task Force, and state Sens. Alan Bates and Ben Westlund all have done wonderful work. But there is no way the states can comprehensively fix health care because the states didn't create the problems. Who did? The federal government did, as the biggest spender of health care dollars in America and the architect of the policies now driving health care toward implosion. So how do we tackle this issue at the national level? The Healthy Americans Act is a road map to providing universal health coverage for the same cost we, as a nation, currently are paying. It works like this: Employers who provide employee health benefits would have to convert their workers' health care premiums into higher wages for two years. Employers who do not offer health benefits would be required to make phased-in "employer shared responsibility payments," which would be used to provide financial assistance to individuals and families with modest incomes. After two years, every employer would make these payments, the size of which would be determined by their ability to pay. In turn, every American would have to purchase private health coverage. To make sure that it's affordable, the plan would pay the full premiums for those who live below the federal poverty line, while folks between 100 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty line would receive subsidies on a sliding scale. The insurance industry also will have to reform. By law, insurers would no longer be allowed to cherry-pick their customers. Currently, insurance companies can choose which customers they sign up - typically the healthy ones - and send those in fragile health to even more fragile government programs. Instead, insurance companies would be required to insure everyone who signs up, no matter their pre-existing conditions, age or gender. And they would be prohibited from raising prices if individuals are sick or are at risk of becoming sick. Prohibiting cherry picking would mean insurance companies finally would be competing with one another on the basis of price, service and health care outcomes, meaning consumers would be the real winners. This prohibition also would give insurance companies a financial incentive to invest in your health, which means we will see movement away from "sick care" and toward real health care, including wellness programs and preventive care. Some on the right want more tax breaks for the wealthy and no universal health care. Some on the left want all insurance companies put out of business. The political reality is that there isn't anywhere close to 60 votes - the number required to move any meaningful legislation under Senate rules - for either proposition. My responsibility is to find ways to bring Democrats and Republicans together to win universal health care as quickly as possible. But even with bipartisan support, making these changes won't be easy. The conventional wisdom is that we'll have to wait until after the presidential race is over before Congress again attempts comprehensive health care reform. I don't think the uninsured and the underinsured can afford to wait that long, so I'm asking Oregonians to help me keep pushing for change now. Let's seize this opportunity. Let's finally reform our broken health care system and provide high quality, affordable coverage for all Americans. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., is a member of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over health care laws. This essay is the eighth in a biweekly series of columns on health care reform.

The donation announced today is the largest private gift the university has ever received, university President Mark A. Emmert said. The university  which receives more government money for scientific research than any other public university  is also putting $20 million toward the new institute. "There has been a huge increase in resources for global health in recent years, and it's essential to evaluate the impact of these investments. With high-quality data, we can ensure resources go where they are needed most, and dramatically improve health care delivery," said Dr. Tadataka "Tachi" Yamada, president of the Gates Foundation's Global Health Program, in a statement issued before the official announcement. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation will be directed by Christopher J.L. Murray, the former director of Harvard's institute for public health. Murray was chosen to lead the Ellison Institute for World Health at Harvard until last year, until Oracle Corp. founder Larry Ellison pulled the $115 million he had promised to Harvard. The University of Washington research center will collect and analyze data on health indicators and trends, such as the availability of health care and the spread of disease. It will study the results of health programs and will make health data freely available to policy-makers, researchers and the public. The university said it expects the institute to hire more than 100 faculty and staff and set up a collaboration network among research centers. "We hope to set the gold standard for scientifically rigorous evaluation in health," said Murray, a health economist. The institute will be led by a board of health experts chaired by Dr. Julio Frenk, a senior fellow at the Gates Foundation and Mexico's former minister of health.

The study is the first to scientifically test an approach that many doctors have tried for patients with advanced colon and rectal cancers. Stressed about debt or know someone who is?

Get a New Job Save & Share Article "It justifies what some of us have already been doing" and shows that aggressively treating patients with limited spread of colorectal cancer is reasonable, said Dr. Jeffrey Meyerhardt, a cancer specialist at Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. About 1 million people worldwide develop colorectal cancer each year, including more than 150,000 in the United States, where it is the third most common major cancer. In up to half of all patients, the disease spreads after initial treatment to the liver. For many cancers, spread to the liver means the disease has also spread elsewhere, is incurable and surgery isn't an option. But with colorectal cancer, sometimes the disease spreads only to the liver, and surgery to remove these growths increasingly is being attempted, said Dr. Neal Meropol, director of the gastrointestinal cancer program at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. Even so, recurrence is common, and only about 30 percent of patients who have this surgery survive five years. In the new study, 42 percent of patients who got chemotherapy before and after the liver surgery had no recurrence after an average of four years, versus 33 percent of patients who had surgery alone. The good results mean the approach could become standard treatment for these patients, said Dr. Bernard Nordlinger, the lead author and a cancer specialist at Ambroise Pare Hospital in Paris. Nordlinger presented the results in Chicago at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting. A separate colorectal cancer study presented Monday showed the targeted cancer drug Erbitux can modestly improve survival when added to standard chemotherapy in patients whose disease has spread. Patients who got Imclone Systems Inc.'s drug survived an average of 8.9 months without disease progression versus eight months for those who got chemotherapy alone. "Although we would all love to have huge breakthroughs that would revolutionize cancer treatment, those are few and far between," said Northwestern University's Dr. Al Benson III. Instead, cancer treatment advances typically come in smaller but important steps like the colorectal cancer studies presented Monday, which over time lead to real progress, Benson said. The chemotherapy-plus-surgery study involved 151 patients who had both treatments and 152 who had surgery alone. Complications, including diarrhea and reduced amounts of disease-fighting white blood cells, were more common in chemotherapy patients but were still within an acceptable range, Nordlinger said. A separate study presented Monday involved primary liver cancer _ disease that originates in the liver rather than spreads there. Researchers said they have found the first drug that improves survival for liver cancer patients _ a breakthrough that likely will become standard treatment. Those results occurred in patients with advanced liver cancer treated with the drug sorafenib, or Nexavar, which is marketed by Bayer Pharmaceuticals Corp. and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. to treat advanced kidney cancer. The companies are expected to seek U.S. approval this summer for treating liver cancer with the drug.

Your Newspaper. Parishes prepare for hurricane season Friday, June 1, 2007, saw the beginning of Hurricane Season, and several local parishes claim they were ready. All agreed, though, that the West Bank of the Mississippi, which escaped flooding in Katrina, is the area in the most danger. At a press conference at City Hall Thursday evening, the Mayor and his staff laid out the city's evacuation plan in the event of a Cat 3 Hurricane. "The nation will be watching next time," Col. Terry Ebbert, New Orleans' Homeland Security Director told the press on the eve of the first day of Hurricane season, emphasizing that the city's economic future is in danger another evacuation is botched. For safety's sake, the Homeland Security Director urged people to leave in the event of another Category 3 storm. "There were will be no shelters in Orleans Parish," Ebbert said. At 84 hours out, the city will implement its evacuation plan. "When that storm clears Cuba, its time to leave," he added as Mayor Nagin's entire executive staff gathered Thursday night in the City Council Chambers. General evacuation begins at 50 hours, with contraflow instituted. The Mayor echoed his Emergency Director. "There are areas in our levee system, and I'm talking about the entire metropolitan area, where we have sections of our levees that are not up to the new standards." "We will have some over topping in some areas where we have warned people in the past," Nagin continued. "Some of the low lying areas of New Orleans East and some of the low lying areas of the Lower Ninth Ward, if another Katrina comes in the same direction, our levees will most likely hold, but there will likely be some overtopping because the gates that are needed right at the point where the levees come together have not been constructed." But, those in the greatest danger, he said, live in the area that escaped Hurricane Katrina basically unharmed. "In Algiers, the levee system, and the West Bank of Jefferson Parish, those levees have not been built up to the new standards." Flooding from the Harvey Canal area could sweep the population away in the next great flood, so the Mayor warned against "any false sense of security." Those that need help to evacuate should call 311, and enter their name on a special list. City buses will pick up the population that cannot leave and deposit them at pre-arraigned evacuation points. Locations will be determined by the direction of the storms. The city will also be premiering an new text messaging and voice warning system in time for the next storm. It's called NOLA Ready and was developed by the Roam Secure Alert Network (RSAN). RSAN will power the system so that real time emergency messages are delivered to first responders, local government officials, business owners, tourist and registered residents of New Orleans. This system will also allow for shared emergency information with surrounding parishes, across Louisiana and across the country. "NOLA Ready ensures that we can stay connected in the event of another major disaster or even routine emergency situations. We are urging all residents to register with this system through their cell phones so that we can deliver vital information to them and they can be prepared for any emergency circumstances that may arise," said Mayor Nagin. Text communication was the only effective means of communication in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita when most of the region's infrastructure was severely damaged. According to Ebbert, All registered participants will receive information about necessary evacuations, possible flooding, power loss, and communications disruptions. The system will deliver real-time text messages and will also provide situation reports and life-saving alerts to emergency managers via email, cell phones, pagers, blackberries and Treos. A demonstration of the text system will be offered during the briefing. "In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, we understood the necessity of communication not only with federal, state and local officials, but more importantly with our residents," said Ebbert. "The city's communication tools are an important part of emergency preparedness and a major part of our hurricane season plans for the future." "We're getting ready for any type of event that may occur because our main objective is to provide vital public safety information to all of our citizens," said Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Sneed, Director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Preparedness. "NOLA Ready offers that additional tool in a chest of plans and preparations for a major hurricane and any other type of disaster." Jefferson Parish President Aaron Broussard agreed with Nagin that the West Bank was in terrible danger, due to the paupacity of levees along the area's major industrial waterway. "On the West Bank east of the Harvey Canal, is still a tremendous vulnerability for us because it's not a federal levee. It's not a levee that was built by the previous West Jefferson Levee District. It's really a hodgepodge levee that was built by the businesses, along the Harvey Canal, to protect their businesses. So as a result of that, you have everything from railroad ties, to sheet piling to compacted earth, none of which is suitable to withstand a concerted hurricane threat." In fact, prior to Katrina, many corporations fronting the Canal resisted the idea of levees, arguing that it would be destructive to their business activities, explained Chip Cahill, Chairman of the JP Hurricane and Coastal Restoration Committee. He added, though, that since Katrina, they have embraced the floodwall system, but it is only in the early stage of construction. Like Nagin, Broussard maintained that West Bankers should not fall into a fall comfort level because they avoided the worst of Hurricane Katrina. While Broussard said his parish has never been in better shape, however, he added, "It doesn't mean we don't have our vulnerabilities. On the East Bank, when they closed the surge gates-that the Corps built at the lake intersection with the 17th Street Canal-they effectively cut off a great amount of the pumping capacity of Canal Pumping Station # 6 which drains Old Metairie and Old Jefferson." "When those surge gates close, that effectively cuts off today, half of our pumping capacity," from 9000 to 4000 CFS per second, he explained. There is a plan in place by the Corps of Engineers to increase pumping to 7500 CFS, but it will not be in place in time for this Hurricane season. The Jefferson Parish President, in consultation with the state, has developed an active plan for evacuating those that cannot leave on their own. State buses will pick up the evacuees and take them out of the region. "We're going to have our stand bus routes pick up our people on the standard bus routes pick up people along the public transit routes and take them to two designated areas. On the West Bank, they'll be taken to the Alario Center. On the East Bank, they'll be taken to the Yenni Building." Nor need anyone worry that the pumps may not be turned on in the next Hurricane, he said. "Our brand new plan in Jefferson Parish dictates that no essential personnel will ever be evacuated from Jefferson Parish ever again." "At all the major pump stations, East bank and West Bank, that have backflow vulnerability, we have already built safe houses, and tested, so our pump operators can go directly from the pump stations and into the safe houses." In fact, Parish Emergency Director Deano Bonano added, "We have a new philosophy in approaching emergency planning in Jefferson Parish. The philosophy is that we have to be able to sustain our own emergency operations for seven days without outside help." Back up fuel and supplies can last personnel and those trapped over a week in case of an emergency. Nor will communications cut off those working amidst the floodwaters. A new interoperable, 700 Megahertz radio system will allow personnel not only in Jefferson, but in St. Bernard, Plaquemines, and Orleans to communicate. Katrina, Bonano explained, taught his office lessons, and allowed his people to write plans, that had never been on the books before. For example, Jefferson now provides parish businesses with a disaster reentry plan designed to repopulate the parish in tiers. For residents, a "LOOK AND LEAVE" policy will be maintained, just like after Katrina. The Sheriff of Plaquemines Parish asks that if a storm comes, do not take the risk. In an interview, Jeff Hingle emphasized the importance of evacuation. "First of all we would ask them not to stay in their homes. They've got to realize that following Katrina and Rita, we lost substantial wetlands. So, there's going to be less resistance to the water coming in." Katrina left Plaquemines in greater danger than ever before, he explained. "Our barrier islands are totally gone now, so you're going to see more flooding than you have ever seen before." And, the storm protection created by the Corps of Engineers is not ready. "A lot of the levees that have been rebuilt since the hurricane are not ripened yet. They have not been tested. So, I do suggest that you do leave. We'll take care of your property." Police and Parish officials plan to stay on duty throughout the storm and its aftermath. Supplies are on hand to survive without contact for over a week. However, the Sheriff recognized that not all could depart on their own. "We ask them to call the Sheriff's office either through 911, or at 564-2525. Let us know where you're at. If you have no transportation, the deputies will pick you up. They'll bring you to a site where you can be put on public school bus, and moved to a site out of the area." The state has planned a series of evacuation centers in different parts of the state, depending on the course of the storm. Officials in Plaquemines have worked closely with Gov. Blanco's Department of Homeland Security to make sure that the evacuation centers can move the immobile population of the parish out of danger. 'Never Again' became the anthem of Parish President Kevin Davis. He pledged that his parish will never have to rely on an outside agency to survive. In the first days after Katrina, a thirty foot storm surge had cut of swath of destruction from the Lake across Slidell and as far inland as parts of Pearl River, yet as Governor Blanco spoke in the aftermath of the hurricane, she told St. Bernard, Plaquemines, Orleans, and Jefferson "help was on the way." She had no idea the level of destruction in St. Tammany. At that moment, Parish President Kevin Davis pledged that his parish would rely on no one in the case of a storm. He and his council embarked on a crash project to build the most sophisticated emergency operations center in the state. "Many of our staff calls it the War Room," Davis said, "It's a glass room where about fifty or sixty people sit around a large table with their own computer system and phone system, and we monitor everything." With banks of computers and commo gear, it does resemble a cross between the White House Situation Room and the Cabinet War Rooms in London "All of the different fields of specialty are in that room. Utilities companies, police, fire, municipalities, all of us sit there." But, that is not the extent of the Emergency Operations Center, located in the steel and concrete Old Court House in downtown Covington. Food supplies are available for hundreds for weeks. Not only do independent electrical and a commications lines sit in the building, but a separate satellite uplink keeps the emergency center in touch with the state's computer disaster web servers. (In fact, the software that the state plans to use to gather information after a hurricane has been in use in St. Tammany successfully for several years.) Still, Davis acknowledged that a large population might decide to stay, despite his many calls to leave before a storm. The parish needed to be ready to care for that population. "If you remember one of the issues were trying to get food, water, and gasoline. So, this time we have partnered with many of those inside of St. Tammany Parish, so we can be better prepared the next time a hurricane hits." The Northshore leader, though, recognized that some may have trouble evacuating. Prior to Katrina, Davis urged all to go with a 100,000 recorded telephone blast, done three times prior to the Hurricane's land fall. Not all heeded the call. This time, he explained, there can be no excuse. St. Tammany has created "our special needs shelter for those that have special needs." "They need to be pre-registered, and they can do that by calling our [985] 898-2323 number. So that, if there is some issue, transportation and the like, we can help them." Still, as St. Tammany Emergency Direct Dexter Accardo added, not take the risk of staying. "As everybody knows, a storm can turn for the best away from you, or turn for the worst toward you." He urged people to stay turned to the media and evacuation calls. Some are even more vulnerable in St. Tammany Post-Katrina. "At our last count, we're probably at 5,000 FEMA trailers still in this parish-which will equate to a minimum of at least 10,000 people that are not in a regular, rigid structure home. We know that those people are going to need to get out of those trailers." Parish leaders agreed St. Bernard is better prepared for a hurricane now than before Katrina struck but they also contended a Category 3 storm today could bring water again to the parish, although probably not as much as in the past because the levees are taller and built better. A mandatory evacuation would be issued for approaching storms that are a Category 3, which have the potential for heavy destruction, and when storm surge is predicted to be 13 feet. Residents should be ready to leave if a mandatory evacuation is ordered. President Rodriguez added that he believed a strong storm would see more residents heed evacuation warnings because of the experience of Katrina. But if they did not, he warned, there would not find any shelters of last resort opened in St. Bernard in a strong storm because they wouldn't be deemed safe. And at some point it would be unsafe to send out emergency personnel to help people who didn't leave. "I've been in office 32 years and this is the best we have ever been prepared'' for hurricane season, Parish President Henry "Junior'' Rodriguez said in presiding over the conference that brought together the Parish Council, Sheriff Jack Stephens, Fire Chief Thomas Stone, parish Dave Dysart, manager of the parish's Office of Emergency Preparedness, State Commissioner of Agriculture Bob Odom and parish Coroner Bryan Bertucci. Also present were officials from the National Guard, National Weather Service, State Police, State Homeland Security, Acadian Ambulance, the Coast Guard, state Wildlife and Fisheries Department and utility companies and oil refineries. The parish has a new emergency plan that includes use of warning sirens and a AM radio station for residents to get instant reports of what is happening, Rodriguez said. Stephens said communications systems between parish agencies and with the state and other parishes are vastly improved since Hurricane Katrina. The sheriff also said his department has plans for neighborhood patrols during evacuations that would continue until "it is imprudent for officers to be on the streets'' because of safety concerns. Stephens also said his office has 18 boats for rescue operations and SWAT team members are trained in boat patrol. In the event of a flood, 50-60 officers would stay at the Domino's sugar plant in Arabi and 60 National Guard troops would be stationed here along with some heavy equipment. "The Fire Department will be ready'' if there is a hurricane, Fire Chief Thomas Stone said. Mindful that so much equipment was lost in the flood waters of Katrina, Stone said, his department has an agreement in which all apparatus and half the manpower of his department would be moved to Tangipahoa Parish before a hurricane strikes. Rodriguez, Parish Council members Joseph DiFatta, Craig Taffaro Jr., Judy Hoffmeister and Mark Madary, who last week toured the Mississippi River - Gulf Outlet by boat along with officials of the Corps of Engineers, and Bob Turner of the Southeast Louisiana Flood Protection Authority office in St. Bernard, all said it's evident the levees on the MR-GO are in the best shape they have ever been in. They are built to 20 feet and made of better material, clay, than in the past. Let, Difatta in an interview conceded that the levee system stops at the St. Bernard Parish line, allowing storm surge to loop around from the uncompleted levees in the Ninth Ward of New Orleans. The Corps has promised to extend the levee system to 20 ft to the Industrial Canal, but work is still underway. Every panel member acknowledged that residents, though, many still living in FEMA trailers that aren't built to withstand winds of much more than 40 mph, should be ready to evacuate if a strong storm is approaching and should already be compiling a list of what they need to be bringing with them, including prescription medicines, phone numbers, copies of insurance documents, deeds and titles, cash for extended stays and supplies for themselves and their pets. For those who cannot bring pets, the animals can be brought to an announced location during an evacuation and they will be buses to areas in Alexandria, Shreveport and Monroe where they will be taken care of by the state Agriculture Department, Commissioner Odom said. Disabled residents who need help with evacuation should now call the parish Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, at (504) 278-4268, to get registered on a list for those who need help. "We lost 154 people'' in the last hurricane, Coroner Bertucci said. "You need to evacuate'' if it is mandated, he said. "Leave in a timely manner.'' St. Bernard has learned from Katrina, the Council members said. Now, "one of the most important things citizens can do is evacuate if an order is issued,'' DiFatta said. Hoffmeister said early evacuation is key to survival if a strong storm is coming. "The number of disabled people living in FEMA trailers'' who would need assistance is very High, she said. Madary, who has worked to make sure animals at the parish animal shelter would be evacuated as well parish residents, said, "Success begins with preparation'' for a storm. "All of us can look at Katrina as a learning lesson.'' Dysart said there are specific timelines for action based on where a hurricane is. The Office of Emergency Preparedness would go on alert when gale force winds are an estimated 72 hours from the Gulf Coast, Dysart said. At 60-55 hours out, special needs residents could be evacuated, while at 50-40 hours out, residents would be ordered to evacuate areas outside the levee protection system, and at 40-30 hours out there could be an order of evacuation for the entire parish. The state's contraflow plan would start at 30 hours out from land. Stephens said his office can't force people to evacuate but they would be told at some point that emergency personnel couldn't help them because of safety factors. "They would be on their own'' if they didn't leave, the sheriff said. - Copyright 2005, Louisiana Weekly Publishing Company

The toothpaste, which reportedly contains a poison used in antifreeze, has turned up in Miami, the Port of Los Angeles and Puerto Rico, according to the Times. Click here to read the New York Times story. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warned consumers on Friday that toothpaste imported from China could contain diethylene glycol (DEG), the same substance used as a solvent in antifreeze. The Administration advises that any toothpaste with the label be thrown away because excess exposure to DEG could be harmful. There have not yet been any reported cases of problems from Chinese-made toothpaste in the United States, but deaths and injuries have been reported in other countries as a result of consumption of DEG through cough syrups and acetaminophen syrup. Toothpaste Made in China Could Contain DEG, Cause Injury Fast Facts: Brands of Toothpaste That May Contain Toxin The FDA is particularly concerned that if children and those with liver disease within the U.S. consume too much of the substance, injury could result. Brands of toothpaste from China that contain DEG are: Cooldent Fluoride, Cooldent Spearmint, Cooldent ICE, Dr. Cool, Everfresh Toothpaste, Superdent Toothpaste, Clean Rite Toothpaste, Oralmax Extreme, Oral Bright Fresh Spearmint Flavor, Bright Max Peppermint Flavor and ShiR Fresh Mint Fluoride Paste. Manufacturers of these toothpaste products are: Goldcredit International Enterprises Limited, Goldcredit International Trading Company Limited and Suzhou City Jinmao Daily Chemicals Company Limited. Reports from other countries such as Panama regarding DEG contamination in toothpaste manufactured in China prompted the FDA to examine toothpaste and other dental products exported to the United States. They confiscated one shipment of toothpaste at the U.S. border and tested toothpaste products from China located at a distribution center and a retail store. This is not the first time, however, that the FDA has warned against DEG contamination in the United States. They recently warned pharmaceutical manufactures that the substance could be present in glycerin, a sweetener commonly used worldwide in liquid over-the-counter and prescription drug products. The FDA is continuing to look for DEG in other toothpaste products and will add them to their import alerts should DEG be found. Adverse reactions or problems resulting from Chinese made toothpaste can be reported to the FDA&#8217;s MedWatch Adverse Event Reporting program at www.fda.gov/medwatch/report.htm or (800) 332-1088.

The man, who worked at a poultry slaughterhouse in the capital, Hanoi, has been hospitalized since he fell sick last week, the Tien Phong (Pioneer) newspaper said. Vietnamese laboratory tests showed he was infected with the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus strain, the newspaper said. It did not name the man. The paper quoted doctor Nguyen Duc Hien as saying the patient is now in a safe condition. Hien could not immediately be reached for comment. Today in Asia - Pacific Hong Kong remembers Tiananmen Beijing climate-change strategy has no emission caps Philippine troops defuse bus bomb after U.S. warning Hanoi hospitals have received several patients with bird flu-like symptoms in the past few days, said Nguyen Thuy Hanh director of Bach Mai hospital. Their test results are expected soon, Hanh said. Bird flu has spread rapidly as it hit 14th province in northern Vietnam, the second province in a week, according to a posting on a government Web site. Last month, Vietnam confirmed its first human case of bird flu in 18 months. At least 42 people have died of bird flu in Vietnam, though no deaths have been reported since November 2005. No poultry outbreaks were reported in 2006, but a recent wave of farm outbreaks has killed or led to the slaughter of more than 50,000 fowl. Vietnam was hailed as a success story in combatting the virus, which began ravaging Asian poultry stocks in late 2003. A nationwide mass poultry vaccination program and strong political efforts were credited with bringing the disease under control. The H5N1 strain is difficult for people to catch, but experts fear it could mutate into a form that spreads easily among people.

The announcement comes as the agency braces for new criticism over how it handled public communications after a recent medical journal article revealed GlaxoSmithKline's diabetes drug Avandia may increase the risks of heart attack. The British drug maker said it provided information cited in the article to the FDA last August. Lawmakers in the House say they plan to investigate why the FDA did not notify doctors and patients about the information earlier. The FDA said the new 15-member panel will help the agency develop plans for publicizing risks and benefits of the products it regulates. The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its advisory groups, though it often does. The Institute of Medicine, a nongovernment advisory group, last year recommended the FDA create such a panel. The idea was in the group's report for improving the FDA's drug safety system after the Vioxx controversy. Merck pulled that widely sold pain medication from the market in 2004 after studies showed it could increase risk of heart attack and stroke. The agency seeks experts in marketing, communication and other social sciences who are not affiliated with the FDA to serve on the panel.

The feds say a scheming quartet duped a city insurance carrier out of $300,000 by claiming reimbursements for 20 brain surgeries that were never performed. Stanley Cannella pocketed $142,238 in reimbursements for nine brain surgeries on himself, his wife and two sons between 2003 and 2006, Manhattan federal prosecutors say. The 36-year-old city employee from Manhattan is being sought. Three others were arrested Thursday. Prosecutors say phony post-operative reports were sent to GHI, claiming reimbursements for sham patients that included family members who claimed to have undergone the high-priced neurosurgery. The alleged mastermind of the scheme was Charles Pritchett, 39, of Mount Vernon, Westchester County, who worked at a medical billing company in Hawthorne, Westchester County. Pritchett had access to insurance claims forms for two patients who had undergone the surgery, the feds say. Prosecutors say the scheme worked like this: Pritchett created dummy claims forms for Cannella and co-defendant Dorothy Smith, 42, of Manhattan, and sent them to GHI along with the post-op reports. GHI then mailed back reimbursements to Cannella, Smith and Michael Biscotti, 37, a city employee from Staten Island. Biscotti is accused of depositing $31,041 in reimbursement for sham surgeries on himself and his wife. Smith took in $131,397 for nine phantom brain surgeries for her, her husband and a daughter, prosecutors say. GHI alerted the feds to the fraud. Pritchett is facing 90 years and the others 30 years apiece on charges of mail and health care fraud.

http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/Sleep-trauma-could-be-sexual-behaviours/2007/06/02/1180205551987.html&cid Sleep trauma could be sexual behaviours - Breaking News - World - Breaking News Welcome to The Age. Sleep trauma could be sexual behaviours June 2, 2007 - 7:49AM A wide range of sleep disorders carry some risk of inappropriate sexual behaviours during sleep, or even waking hours, according to a new report. Abnormal sexual activities during sleep - known as "sexsomnia" or "sleepsex" - include anything from moaning to masturbating to making sexual advances toward a bed partner, all while in a state somewhere between deep sleep and wakefulness. Sexsomnia is officially recognised as a subtype of parasomnia, a group of disorders that includes sleepwalking, sleep talking and night terrors, among others. But abnormal sexual behaviours can affect people with a wide range of sleep-related disorders, according to the new report, published in the journal Sleep. Inappropriate sexual behaviours have been described in people with sleep disorders as diverse as parasomnias, severe insomnia and restless legs syndrome. In some cases, the sexual behaviours are not sexsomnia, but occur during waking hours, said Dr Carlos H Schenck, the lead author of the report and a senior staff psychiatrist at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Centre in Minneapolis. One example is Kleine-Levin syndrome, a rare disorder that causes recurrent bouts of excessive drowsiness and sleep. People with this disorder sleep for stretches of 16 to 24 hours, but when awake, some may become extremely "hypersexual" and uninhibited. "We wanted to call attention to how virtually all known categories of sleep disorders carry a risk for inappropriate sexual behaviours," said Schenck, who is also author of the book Sleep: The Mysteries, the Problems, and the Solutions. This is important, he told Reuters Health, because people with these problems should be aware that they are part of a sleep-related disorder that can be diagnosed and treated - and not a sign of perversion. In the case of sexsomnia, the problem is usually a "disorder of arousal" from non-dream sleep. This means that people are partially aroused from deep sleep, resulting in a "twilight sleep-wake state" where they unconsciously act, with seriously impaired judgment. In their report, Schenck and his colleagues detail the range of sleep disorders that can be accompanied by sexsomnia or waking-hour sexual problems. The parasomnias and Kleine-Levin syndrome are the disorders most commonly associated with abnormal sexual behaviours. But other sleep disorders can involve such behaviours as well. For instance, Schenck said, there have been a few reported cases among men with obstructive sleep apnea, a disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during the night, causing symptoms like loud snoring and daytime drowsiness. These cases came to light when the men's partners complained that they were trying to have sex with them while snoring. Similarly, sexsomnia has been reported among people suffering from sleep-related epileptic seizures. Schenck said people who think they have sexsomnia or waking-hour problems should talk to their doctors, who may then refer them to a sleep centre for a full evaluation. On the other hand, he noted, there is such a thing as "normal" sleepsex. Some couples have no issue with the behaviour, and in fact find it more exciting and amorous than their waking-hour routines. In these cases, Schenck said, sleepsex wouldn't be considered a "problem". Reuters, Click for Restrictions When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

Health experts are of the opinion that with nearly two years past from the havoc the Katrina wreaked on New Orleans, it still remains a killer. Storm survivors are dying from the effects of both psychological and physical stress, from the dust and mold still in dwellings to financial problems to fear of crime, health experts and officials say. "There is no doubt in my mind that Katrina is still killing our residents," Orleans Parish coroner Dr. Frank Minyard said this week. "People with pre-existing conditions that are made worse by the stress of living here after the storm; old people who are just giving up; people who are killing themselves because they feel they can't go on," Minyard said. New Orleans medical officials say that jump, from 11.3 per 1,000 deaths to 14.3 per 1,000, - a leap of more than 25 percent - was anything but slight. Moreover, the report doesn't take into account evacuees who died while away from the city and were returned for burial. The city was abandoned after Katrina struck Aug. 29, 2005, and many people did not begin returning until mid-2006. Local mental health professionals say they are encountering more people with psychological problems. "We're seeing triple the number of people with mental health problems as we were before Katrina," said Leah Hedrick, social worker at Ochsner Hospital. "Depression, suicidal, anxiety, abuse of drugs and alcohol, and along with that comes a lot more physical problems." Many storm-damaged hospitals are not operating fully, and that could help explain why other health facilities are seeing more patients. Minyard believes the medical community's different observations reach the same conclusion, and one day will be proven correct. "Years from now when they talk about post-traumatic stress, New Orleans after Katrina will be the poster child," he said.

There are at least 11 different sex-related sleep disorders, collectively referred to as 'sexsomnia' or 'sleepsex', that affect people who are otherwise psychologically healthy-causing them to unknowingly engage in various sexual activities during the night. Carlos Schenck, a psychiatrist at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Centre, and his colleagues have studied a number of behavioural disorders associated with sleep. "Any basic instinct can come out in the context of sleep," Schenck told LiveScience. Recently, he and his colleagues turned their focus to sex-related sleep disorders. They conducted computerised medical literature searches for studies published between 1950 and 2006 related to sleep and sexual behaviour and looked through a number of sleep medicine textbooks. They also analysed data from a previously completed internet survey that had gathered data from 219 people, 92% of whom had experienced multiple 'sexsomnia' episodes. Among other things, they found that peopleâmostly menâsometimes masturbate, initiate sex with a partner and reach orgasm during sleep. They usually have no memory of these activities when they wake up, learning about them only if a partner or roommate tells them. Some of these activities can also have legal consequences, such as if someone initiates sex without a partnerâs consent, noted Schenck. People are at risk for developing sex-related sleep disorders when they also tend to suffer from other sleep disordersâsuch as sleepwalking or sleep terrors, according to Schenck. "Sexsomnia doesnât come out of nowhere,â he said. But âfor whatever reason, sexual behaviours become part of the repertoire." While people might feel ashamed to learn from their partners that they are exhibiting these behaviours while they sleep, these disorders are not indicative of psychological problems, noted Schenck. And 'sexsomnia' disorders are easily treated with medication, said Schenck, whose study is published this week in the journal Sleep. News in this Section Short-tempered adults face lung problems?

This remains true even though marriage quality is poorer for depressed individuals. Adrianne Frech and Kristi Williams, Ph.D. from Ohio State University in Columbus co-wrote the study. It appears in the June issue of the Journal of Health and Social Behavior âBased on previous research, we hypothesized that people who are depressed would have worse marital quality and would therefore experience fewer benefits from marriage,â Frech said, âbut that is not what we found.â The researchers speculate that marriage might provide a level of companionship that depressed singles typically lack. Frechâs team used data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The study included 3,066 unmarried people aged 55 years and under. To identify depressed individuals, researchers used a 12-item test for depression and considered respondents depressed if they scored 23 or more points on the test. After a follow-up period of five years, researchers identified people who married during the period, asked about the quality of their marriages and how their psychological well-being changed. The study excluded participants who married but ended up divorcing before the five-year follow-up. Researchers found that the participants who married within the five-year period scored an average of about 3.5 points lower on the depression test than those who remained single. Of all the depressed participants, those who got married scored an average 7.5 points lower on the mood scale than the people who remained single. The non-depressed experienced a smaller change in their psychological well-being if they got married. Results from the study confirmed that depressed people report less marital happiness and more marital conflict. Nevertheless, being married enhanced their mood. Previous studies also suggest that depressed people benefit from stable social support more than the non-depressed. Robin Simon, Ph.D., associate professor of sociology from Florida State University in Tallahassee, agrees that this is likely. âThe studyâs findings make perfect sense to me. One symptom of depression is loneliness and lack of companionship. I am not surprised that marriage would supply a psychological boost for the previously depressed,â she said.

A recent study suggests that marriage provides a greater psychological boost to depressed people than to happy people, even if the marriage is so-so. Previous studies have suggested that the psychological perks of marriage depend upon marriage quality â a gives rise to a happy couple, and vice versa. Other studies have shown that depressed people, who tend to communicate poorly and require more caring and support than happy people, also end up in unhappier marriages. So Adrianne Frech, a sociology graduate student at Ohio State University, and her colleague, Kristi Williams, speculated that happy people would garner more psychological perks from marriage than depressed people. To test their theory, they looked at a sample of 3,066 who had been interviewed and tested for depression once in either 1987 or 1988 and then again five years later. In the interviews, they were asked about the quality of their marriage (if they were married). On average, controlling for differences in depression, subjects who had gotten married over the five-year span between the two interviews reported improved psychological well-being in the second interview â scoring an average of 3.42 points lower on the 84-point depression scale â than their counterparts who did not marry. When they teased apart how marriage affected those who had been depressed at the start of the study to those who had been happy, however, they came across something unexpected. The depressed who married scored an average of 7.56 points lower on the depression scale than the depressed who did not marry, while those who were and got married scored only 1.87 points lower on the scale.

The big remaining question, she says, is why depressed people benefit more from marriage than happy people. It could be that marriage provides the companionship and emotional support needed to help alleviate depression, she said. Â© 2007 LiveScience.com. All rights reserved.

http://www.spiritindia.com/health-care-news-articles-10247.html&cid InterAction Statement on President's Renewed AIDS Plan InterAction Statement on President's Renewed AIDS Plan AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome or Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, sometimes written Aids) is a human disease characterized by progressive destruction of the body's immune system. It is widely accepted that AIDS results from infection with HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus). InterAction Statement on President's Renewed AIDS Plan HIV :: InterAction Statement on President's Renewed AIDS Plan As the largest coalition of U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations engaged in relief and development overseas, we applaud President Bush for demonstrating his renewed commitment to HIV/AIDS funding in developing countries by announcing his five-year, $30 billion AIDS plan. We also appreciate his assertion that HIV/AIDS prevention goes hand-in-hand with other development initiatives, such as providing an education to boys and girls around the world. Pleased as we are that President Bush has renewed his commitment to the global fight against HIV/AIDS, we recognize that $30 billion over five years implies that annual funding would plateau only slightly above the fiscal year 2008 level. We urge the President to use his leadership to achieve a more comprehensive approach to HIV/AIDS, other global health issues and poverty alleviation. As development and humanitarian workers, we have extensive experience working with local communities on HIV/AIDS and other development and humanitarian issues. Based on that experience, we believe that for the President's Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) to truly achieve its goal, the HIV/AIDS pandemic must be addressed within a comprehensive approach to improving people's lives. This includes access to child and maternal healthcare, food, potable water, disaster assistance and employment. We call on the Bush Administration to also show leadership on strengthening our government's commitment to improving health systems and helping people improve the quality and safety of their lives. The President is right to emphasize the role of the U.S. as a leader in HIV/AIDS funding, economic development, and the development of alternative energy sources. While slightly increasing and extending current PEPFAR funding levels is laudable, more resources must also be made available to achieve a truly comprehensive approach to fighting HIV/AIDS, as well as achieving effective poverty-focused development.

The US government on Friday issued a warning against the use of China-made toothpastes, saying they may contain a toxic chemical diethylene glycol (DEG). FDAâs warning to discard all Chinese made toothpastes was issued when the US health watchdog FDA found the presence of DEG in Chinese-made toothpastes at three stores: a Dollar Plus store in Miami, a Todo A Peso store in Puerto Rico and a store in Los Angeles. However, calling the FDAâs warning "unscientific, irresponsible and contradictory", China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) in a statement posted on its Web site late Saturday said that low levels of diethylene glycol have been deemed safe for consumption. In response to the FDA notice, AQSIQ said, "Our research shows that toothpaste containing up to 15.6 percent diethylene glycol, the chemical that the US side is concerned about, is safe, even after prolonged use." "So far we have not received any report of death resulting from using the toothpaste. The U.S. handling (of this case) is neither scientific nor responsible," AQSIQ said in the statement. Diethylene Glycol or DEG is an inexpensive chemical used in industrial products such as in antifreeze, brake fluids and various solvents. It is used by counterfeiters as a substitute for Glycerin, a relatively expensive but safe additive commonly found in food, drugs and household products. Glycerin is used as a thickening agent and a sweetener in toothpaste. DEG poisoning is an important public safety issue. This came into light when the deadly chemical was used in cold medicines in Panama resulting in the death of about 100 people. This has led to an international outcry regarding the safety standards of Chinese exports. China's food regulator said that all the toothpaste exported to the United States had been registered by the U.S. health agency for marketing in the country. They also said that a list of the ingredients in the toothpaste exported to the US had been offered to the FDA. The list included diethylene glycol. The AQSIQ further contends that the FDAâs concerns about the chemicalsâ quantity in Chinese toothpastes is useless as even EU standards allow for a certain amount of chemical, and a Chinese study in 2000 found toothpaste containing less than 15.6 percent of the drug was not harmful. FDA said that various brands such as Cooldent, Clean Rite and Oralmax have been found to be contaminated; some of them have the concentration of DEG as high as 3 to 4 percent. According to the FDA, the companies manufacturing products containing DEG are Goldcredit International Enterprises Ltd., Goldcredit International Trading Co. Ltd., and Suzhou City Jinmao Daily Chemicals Co. Ltd. The US health agency is concerned about the fact that DEG can pose a low but significant risk of toxicity and injury to children and people suffering from kidney or liver diseases, on chronic exposure to the chemical. However, experts from the Chinese Health Ministry deemed the chemical a "low-level" poison that does not accumulate in the human body. They also said that there is no evidence that the chemical in question can cause cancer or deformities. The AQSIQ has lodged a representation to the FDA and urged the US health watchdog to clarify the facts in a scientific manner at the earliest. Meanwhile, in order to limit the adverse effects, FDA has issued an import alert on Friday for all dental products containing DEG. All brands will be tested for DEG and those which contained DEG previously will have to prove that the chemical is no longer present. As per the reports, China accounts for about $3.3 million out of the $2 billion toothpaste market in America. Submitted by Wally Lama (not verified) on Mon, 2007-06-04 21:33. I dont see how China can put stuff in there products that hurt people. Does this mean if we ship the stuff back to them they would use it? Are they that dumb? Id like to know if anyone in China have gotten sick or died because of this. I also wanna know if China uses American products and if they were as bad? Boycott all of China! Submitted by Ken (not verified) on Mon, 2007-06-04 21:24. When we were in the cold war with the Soviets...would anyone buy anything with the label: "Made in the USSR"??? Then why in the world would anyone buy anything made in communist China??? Same difference! Buy american...its the best guarantee of our security. China: a model of outstanding honesty in all things.

There is no question China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) is without a doubt much more trustworthy and scientifically superior to this United States Food and Drug Administration. China, known the world over as synonymous with the highest quality standards, would never knowingly place any human being, regardless of nationality or party affiliation, at even the slightest perceived risk. The manner and regard that the United States FDA cautioned consumers is unacceptable, especially since Diethylene Glycol is only a poison of low toxicity, and a suitable proven prefered safe alternative may cost as much as several cents more.

He may be suffering from "sexsomnia", according to the latest research from psychiatrists. The term describes a condition in which abnormal sexual behaviour is associated with sleep disorders. People who suffer severe, chronic insomnia may also exhibit a surge in sex drive, genital arousal, and "compulsive sexual behaviours", say researchers. Often the effects of "sexsomnia" emerge at night and coincide with sleep disturbances. Sleepwalking and "confusional arousal" - when a person performs unconscious complex actions while still asleep - may be accompanied by sexual vocalisations, fondling, sexual aggression and even sexual intercourse. In some cases, "sexsomnia" behaviour can be upsetting or frightening for the sleeper&#039;s partner. Dr Carlos Schenck, senior psychiatrist at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Centre in Minneapolis, who led a review of documented cases of the phenomenon, said: "It seems that more and more reports are surfacing of abnormal sexual behaviours emerging during sleep. "While people may think this type of behaviour is humorous, in reality it can be disturbing, annoying, embarrassing and a potentially serious problem for some individuals and couples. "Despite their awareness of the condition, many sufferers often delay seeking help, either because they don&#039;t know that it&#039;s a medical disorder, or for fear that others will instead judge it as wilful behaviour." Dr Schenck and fellow researchers conducted computerised literature searches of journal articles and scoured text books and other sources for information on sexual behaviours associated with sleep disorders. A list of "sexsomnia" sleep problems compiled by the team appears in the June issue of the journal Sleep.

The new at-home screening test is called Fertell, and comes with both his and her components. The test for the male, works by assessing the ability of a man's sperm to swim through a solution similar to cervical mucus, as well as the number able to do so, said Dr. Keith B. Isaacson, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School. The female test, is a urine stick that measures the level of follicle-stimulating hormone on the third day of the menstrual cycle. An abnormally high level, is an indicator that the woman's egg quality is low. Genosis is the name of the company that makes the Fertell test and some doctors state that although it is a neat device, it may not catch any specific problems relating to a man or woman's fertility level: "The FSH test that we do in our officeâ that's actually in this kitâ is the first test we look for when a woman comes for an evaluation," said Dr. Harry Fisch of the Columbia University Medical Center. "This test is not a guarantee that you're fertile or not," Fisch said. "But it's a great start."

All I do is ask questions Still in the shade Just because suncream has a high SPF number doesn&#8217;t mean it will protect you from harmful UVA rays that can lead to wrinkles and cancer, says Anjana Gosaia to not show photographer information --> to not show image description --> to not show enlarge option --> Sunscreen is the snake oil of the 21st-century,&rdquo; said Samuel Rudman, a lawyer at Lerach Coughlin, announcing that the firm was filing a class-action lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court against five leading sunscreen manufacturers. Rudman&rsquo;s allegation &ndash; that the companies behind household names such as Hawaiian Tropic and Neutrogena were misleading consumers about the cancer-protective powers of their products &ndash; was based on the evidence of consumers who had worn sunscreen, but still contracted skin cancer. It sent tremors across the sun-kissed beaches of the Californian coastline. The outcome of this case is still pending, but it&rsquo;s not just our sun-spoilt friends on Santa Monica beach who should be sweating. With Britons set to bask in another scorching summer, even the more sun-savvy tanners, who slather on a high SPF, may not be as protected as they think. Why? Because the SPF rating on the average sunscreen relates only to UVB rays that cause sunburn and are associated with the development of skin cancer, not the wrinkle-causing UVA rays, which, until recently, were thought to be relatively harmless. However, it is now believed that UVA rays penetrate the skin, distorting the structure of cells, elastin and collagen. The cumulative damage is irreversible and can go undetected for years. A growing number of scientists think that prolonged exposure to UVA rays greatly contributes to melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. Brian Diffey, professor of photobiology at Newcastle University, warns: &ldquo;By 2035, there could be 21,000 new cases of melanoma a year in the UK, as those who sunburnt badly in the 1980s and 1990s suffer the long-term effects.&rdquo; Yet millions of people are oblivious to this time bomb and will still spend hours in the sun, striving for a perfect bronze glow. Dr Des Fernandes, a plastic surgeon and founder of Environ skincare, claims that 60% of UVA rays penetrate even the best sunblock. If this is the case, why are we no clearer on what UVA protection sunscreens offer? The problem is that the men in white coats and beauty corporations have failed to establish a universal, SPF-type rating system for UVA, because they have yet to agree on a method of measuring the effectiveness of UVA-blocking products. So, while protection against UVB rays is indicated with a number, such as SPF 15, UVA protection is denoted in many different ways, including broad-spectrum, broad-band protection, numbers and stars. Boots has been commended for attempting to bring clarity to the issue by introducing the star-rating system for UVA protection as early as 1991. However, Cancer Research UK describes it as &ldquo;vague&rdquo; and &ldquo;confusing&rdquo; in the way it measures UVA protection only in relation to UVB: for example, a high-SPF sunscreen with two stars may give better overall protection than a low SPF with three stars. And other critics point out that the star system does not account for photostability (the ability of the product to remain on the skin during sun exposure). Faced with the challenge of creating a standardised guide to UVA protection, beauty companies argue that as long as there is no universal method to objectively measure the long-term effects of UVA on the skin, such a system seems a long way off. Animal testing has proved inconclusive: tests on mice suggest that UVB rays cause melanoma; tests on fish found UVA rays incubated the disease. As Chris Flower of the Cosmetic, Toiletry and Perfumery Association (CTPA), a group that promotes the interests of companies such as Estée Lauder, Johnson & Johnson and Procter & Gamble, says: &ldquo;It takes time to prove a scientific theory. If UVA takes years to lead to premature ageing, how are you going to test the product&rsquo;s benefit if it won&rsquo;t show for years?&rdquo; Various companies claim to have discovered their own &ldquo;ground-breaking&rdquo; products to protect against UVA rays. L&rsquo;Oréal says its patented filters, Mexoryl SX and Mexoryl XL, contained in brands such as Ambre Solaire, form the most effective UVA filtering system available. Other companies suggest that mineral filters &ndash; the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide contained in Z01 Body Protection Lotion, for example &ndash; provide the best broad-band UVA and UVB protection. Fernandes believes his Environ range of antioxidant-rich products will fight the free radicals caused by sun exposure, and that this is crucial to preventing skin cancer. The New York dermatologist Dr Dennis Gross, the man behind MD Skincare, says the answer lies in chelators, a group of metal-binding molecules. He believes chelator-rich products counteract iron, an aggressive free radical found on the skin that generates other free radicals, which, in turn, are a trigger for skin cancer. However, many scientists say that nobody can lay claim to the ultimate UVA protection. &ldquo;Skincare companies are not the founts of all knowledge. Their primary objective is to sell products,&rdquo; says Diffey. &ldquo;There are active ingredients that can provide equal, if not broader, UVA screening than Mexoryl. The protection provided by antioxidants is small; as for chelators, reducing free-radical damage can help, but shade and clothing can provide you with 10 times the protection of these ingredients.&rdquo; His only advice to people wanting to protect themselves from harmful rays is: &ldquo;Stay indoors with the curtains closed.&rdquo; But, as we head into the holiday season, that is not going to happen. However, there is hope on the horizon. The European Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association (Colipa) has developed a test-tube (in vitro) method of assessing UVA protection that meets European commission recommendations. This could form the basis for a universal system, but initially it would apply only to Europe. The CTPA has indicated that it plans to adopt Colipa&rsquo;s standardised system, but due to product cycles, sunscreens featuring the Colipa logo will not appear until next year. Seemingly, sun-worshippers will have to remain in the shade for at least one more summer.

It's another year for Relay for Life and this year it will be from the night of Saturday, June 9, through to the morning of Sunday, June 10. The purpose of the race is a unique fun way to raise money for the Jamaica Cancer Society while increasing cancer awareness and celebrating survivorship. The Relay for Life involves teams of 15 or more people taking turns walking or running around a track, relay style, for the duration of the event. It is a non-competitive, team-building event. Participants come from businesses, churches, schools, service clubs and various other organisations. Teams are formed to rally in support of a co-worker or loved one who is fighting or has lost the battle with cancer. The first Relay For Life was held in 2003 and it has grown every year. In March, American, Dr. John Kelly, who introduced the Relay For Life concept to Jamaica, was recognised for his contribution to the local society's fight against the disease. Each team member pays a registration fee of $700 and is asked to raise $5,000 in donations to support the Jamaica Cancer Society programmes of education, screening and outreach. Participants receive a Relay for Life T-shirt, as well as information on how to help raise money. Corporate sponsors are secured to help underwrite the costs and encourage community involvement. Tom Conner (on bagpipes) is followed by well-wishers and cancer survivors at the launch of the luminary ceremony at the Jamaica Cancer Society's Relay for Life, held at the Police Officers' Club on Hope Road last year. Teams camp around the track and participate in a variety of activities while waiting their turn to relay. From karaoke to soca aerobics, there has always been something for all. Relay for Life is a celebration of cancer survivors. For the cancer survivor, it provides an opportunity to see old friends, meet new ones and share experiences. The first lap of the relay, on Saturday at 6:00 p.m. is led by cancer survivors. Later, at 10:00 p.m., the luminary (candlelight) ceremony is held to remember those who have lost the battle.

"The Risk Communication Advisory Committee will bring together a broad range of experts and views to help improve FDA's communication of the science-based information about product risks and benefits that the public needs to make informed decisions," said Randall Lutter, the agency's acting deputy commissioner for policy. The FDA said the committee will be made up of 15 voting members who are not affiliated with the agency. While the agency is not bound to the recommendations of its advisory committees, it generally follows them.

The theme will be âCarnival for a Cure.â Starting at 5 p.m. Friday there will be a moonwalk, childrenâs games and food concessions, followed by a silent auction at 6 p.m. Activity bracelets for admittance to the childrenâs games and moonwalk will be on sale for $5 at the registration tent. At 7 p.m., about 200 local cancer survivors will kick off the event by taking the first lap around the track. The luminaria ceremony begins at 9 p.m. and will feature a program of speakers, including Dr. Sharon Soule of Lawrence Memorial Hospitalâs Oncology Center, Pat Slabaugh of Douglas County Bank and cancer survivor Eileen Huffman. During this ceremony, thousands of luminarias will be lit in honor of survivors and in memory of lives lost to cancer. Anyone wanting to purchase a luminaria or make a donation may do so at the event. For more information, contact Tina Yates at 749-2985. The event is a fundraiser for the American Cancer Society, which works to find ways to prevent, detect and treat cancer. Itâs a small but meaningful word for Lawrence cancer survivor Dianna Nelson, who wears a purple-and-white bracelet with âhopeâ inscribed on it. That same four-letter word will help inspire Nelson and others at Fridayâs Douglas County Relay for Life when it is spelled out in hundreds of luminarias that honor those stricken by cancer. Nelson recalled seeing hope for the first time shortly after being diagnosed with breast cancer May 8, 2002, at age 54. âI donât know why that just struck me,â Nelson said. âI just got the best feeling. It gave me the strength to get through that next year.â Nelson decided to attend her first Relay for Life â an annual 12-hour event that benefits the American Cancer Society â after seeing fliers at Lawrence Memorial Hospitalâs Oncology Center. She went after having her second chemotherapy treatment that day. âI felt strong enough to kind of go out and see what it was all about. I had to put on a hat because I was starting to lose my hair,â she said. âWhen I saw all of the participants and the survivor lap and the luminaria ceremony, it was just really inspiring.â That lap served as a motivational tool for Nelson as she faced a lumpectomy in August and radiation treatments. âI told my husband, âNext year, I am going to be back here. I am going to be a survivor. I am going to participate,ââ she said. And she did. She and her husband, Steve, were part of the First Christian Church team. She became team captain in 2004. That same year, she had a recurrence of cancer. âThere was a lot of pain in my hip area and I just had to have radiation for that,â she said. âIt kind of caused me to take an even longer look at life.â As part of that re-evaluation, she retired from working in the Douglas County Childhood Development Association office and began serving as an inspiration to others through support groups such as Bosom Buddies and by volunteering. For nearly three years, she has been a volunteer in the Oncology Center, where she works from noon to 4 p.m. Wednesdays. While there, her jobs include serving and transporting patients, cleaning rooms and running errands. Stephanie Norris, a registered nurse at the center, said while Nelson provides those valuable services, she also can relate to what the patients are going through. âI think she knows what it is like to be sitting in that treatment chair,â Norris said. Wellsville native Ardena Yakle, who was receiving a treatment Wednesday, agreed. âI think itâs nice to have a volunteer here who has been through chemo and the radiation and everything else,â said Yakle, who had a mastectomy in March and will be undergoing treatments until August. âWhen you see people who have survived it, you think you can, too.â Yakle plans to follow in Nelsonâs footsteps and participate in her first Relay for Life on Friday. And Reaumur Donnally, also an Oncology Center volunteer, plans to cheer them on. He said the event can be motivational for anyone. âThe first lap is inspiring. You see the courage and optimism of cancer survivors of all ages,â he said. âItâs a culture for healing, helping and moving forward.â Thatâs exactly what Nelson has done. She now serves on the Relay for Life committee and is committed to raising awareness about cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates about 2.5 million new cancer cases will be diagnosed this year. âItâs just amazing how much cancer touches lives these days,â Nelson said. She never expected to become a victim because it wasnât something that had been in her family. Now she urges her grown children â Donna Binns and Chris Nelson â to take extra precautions. Living through the ordeal has given Nelson a new perspective on life. âYou value life more and you live for the day rather than worry about whatâs going to happen in the future or whatâs happened in the past,â she said. âI think it does change how you feel about life and people.â LJWorld.com doesn't necessarily condone the comments here, nor does it review every post.

The man, whose name was not released and who worked at a poultry slaughterhouse in the capital , was hospitalized on May 19, days after he fell sick, a local newspaper called Tien Phone was cited as saying. The paper said a Vietnamese laboratory conducted tests and found the man who experienced breathing difficulties, a runny nose and a persistent chill, was actually infected with the lethal H5N1 bird flu virus. The doctor Nguyen Duc Hien who took care of the patient said the patient is now in a stable condition. No further information on the man was available from Hien. Media cited Nguyen Thuy Hanh director of Bach Mai hospital was saying that a few other patients with bird flu-like symptoms received treatment in hospital in the past few days, but their test results are expected soon. The first case in the last two weeks involved a 30-year old man from Vinh Phus province who tested positive for the bird flu on May 20. The man, who reportedly slaughtered chicken for a friends wedding, is reportedly being treated at is known for its aggressive measures taken to protect against the spread of the bird flu. Culling and mass vaccination are two measures the government used to have successfully gotten previous bird flu outbreaks since 2003 under control. The early outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu are believed to have infected 94 and killed at least 42 people in , but no more deaths have been reported since November 2005, media reported. A recent wave of outbreaks has killed or led to culling of more than 50,000 birds. Bird flu has reportedly spread rapidly to 14th province in northern , according to a government posting, cited by the Associated Press. H5N1 is highly pathogenic or virulent. But it is largely a disease of birds. It is not easy for people to get infected and it's particularly hard for the virus to spread from human to human as it's too lethal to spread from one host to another. According to the World Health Organization, the H5N1 strain has killed at least 187 people worldwide. Experts and government officials worldwide are worried that persistent outbreaks may create an opportunity for the virus to mutate into a more dangerous strain, leading to world flu pandemic and potentially killing millions of people.

China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine says the advisory from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is unscientific and irresponsible. China says low-levels of the chemical, diethylene glycol, have been approved for consumption. It also says the U.S. food regulator has approved all Chinese-made toothpaste exported to the United States. On Friday, the U.S. government warned consumers to avoid using toothpaste made in China after the FDA found diethylene glycol, or DEG, in a shipment seized at the border and in two U.S. retail stores. The FDA said it is not aware of any reports of poisoning from the toothpaste, but that it is concerned about sick people and children being exposed to the chemical. The FDA has been scrutinizing toothpaste imported from China after similar products containing the chemical killed or sickened users in Latin America. Some information for this report was provided by AP and Reuters.

Jeffrey Bedey had just touted could handle an upwelling of mud from Lake Pontchartrain if another Katrina strikes. "They can't pump sludge," she said, referring to the 17th Street Canal pumps. Bedey, who commands the Army Corps of Engineers' Hurricane Protection Office, had a ready answer: "The intent in an impending storm is to close the gates early, which prevents water and/or sludge from entering the canal." His audience may not have left the meeting entirely reassured, but then Bedey was defending a system of temporary pumps and gates that, while presumably stronger than what was in place pre-Katrina, still is only a stopgap measure in the quest for protection against a once-in-100-years hurricane. Each time he spars with the knowledgeable, skeptical public officials who have been betrayed by the corps once before, Bedey delivers more or less the same message: Much progress has been made in shoring up the area's levees and canals, but much work remains. Then come the tough questions, made more urgent by the start of a hurricane season that forecasters predict will be more severe than normal. But after the public grilling is over, most of his inquisitors give Bedey a thumbs-up review. A year after he arrived in New Orleans, the 47-year-old Bedey and his colleagues at the corps have accomplished a seemingly impossible public relations feat: They have won the grudging trust of city and parish officials whose constituents lost countless homes to the catastrophic breaches of corps levees after Hurricane Katrina. As commander of the Hurricane Protection Office, Bedey is in charge of flood protection on the east bank, including some of the area's most disaster-prone waterways: the 17th Street Canal, the Industrial Canal and the Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet. A lean 6-feet-5 in Army fatigues and brown lace-up boots, Bedey would be an intimidating physical presence but for his casual demeanor. He is as likely to put an arm around a disgruntled parish official as to defend himself with statistics. His unerring people skills have even transformed a few public meetings into veritable love fests, with local officials praising him for his honesty and accessibility. "The colonel is a very frank individual. He doesn't beat around the bush," said Chris Roberts, a Jefferson Parish councilman who has been openly critical of the corps. "That doesn't mean I'm satisfied with the corps' progress. The difference with Bedey is that if a deadline is not going to be reached, he's going to come to you as soon as he knows that. He's not one to say, 'We'll get it done, we'll get it done' and in the ninth inning change that." The positive vibes are conditioned, of course, on whether the corps can follow through on its promises not to fail the New Orleans region again. The good feelings will quickly sour, observers say, if it ever becomes clear that the talk is not being followed by action. While they grumble about the slow pace of work on specific projects, local officials are unstinting in their praise for Bedey and the corps' post-storm outreach initiative. For the first time, they say, the corps is treating them as partners rather than adversaries, showing up regularly to council meetings to solicit input and demonstrating a new willingness to share current information. "We need someone, whether it's good news or bad news, to tell us the truth, and Bedey's the man," said Jefferson Parish Council Chairman Tom Capella. "If it's bad news, we can figure out what the best step is. We don't want someone to withhold information or sugarcoat information. We can take the bad news, but we can't take misinformation." Bedey occupies one corner of a triangular command system established to deal with the enormous job of rebuilding and improving the New Orleans area's devastated levees and canals. Just days after the storm, the corps created Task Force Hope, eventually splitting the responsibilities into two parts: Bedey's Hurricane Protection Office and the Protection Restoration Office, headed by Col. Richard Wagenaar. The Protection Restoration Office's jurisdiction includes hurricane protection duties on the West Bank and in Jefferson and St. Charles parishes, in addition to the non-hurricane-related engineering jobs previously undertaken by the New Orleans district office. Karen Durham-Aguilera, a civilian engineer, succeeded Dan Hitchings as director of Task Force Hope and is the boss of the two colonels, who are equal-ranking in the organization. Collectively, they manage the $7 billion appropriated so far by Congress for New Orleans area hurricane protection. Durham-Aguilera, who came to the job five months ago after directing the corps' Northwestern Division, insisted on living in New Orleans rather than in Mississippi, where Hitchings had been based, because she wanted to be part of the city that she was serving. "To be really committed, to oversee this work that's so immense, that's such a huge mission, to establish relationships with the community -- you can't really do that right unless you're living here," Durham-Aguilera said. "For us, it's the only place to be. It's the place that was affected, it's the center of gravity for the work we're doing." A former champion bodybuilder, Durham-Aguilera views her position as one of her profession's few high-ranking women with a no-big-deal attitude, while recognizing that she is a role model for aspiring female leaders. When Katrina hit in August 2005, Durham-Aguilera was in Iraq, supervising government construction projects throughout the country. Bedey was in Nebraska, where he was commander and chief engineer of the Omaha District. Wagenaar, meanwhile, had arrived in New Orleans just a month before. He found himself in a bunker at the corps' Uptown headquarters commanding a skeleton crew of workers, some of whose names he had not yet had a chance to learn, as the levees gave way and the city flooded. On a helicopter flyover a few days later, he surveyed the extent of the damage. "I didn't know how it had gotten underwater, but my mind was processing the magnitude of the disaster. I couldn't believe it. It sucked the air out of me," Wagenaar said. That extraordinarily wrenching start, plus the marathon grind to repair the levees and then bring them to a 100-year protection level by 2011 in the face of an entrenched bureaucracy, has left Wagenaar "worn out," he said. Last November, he announced his retirement from the corps. He will be replaced in July by Col. Alvin Lee, who currently works at the construction equipment firm Caterpillar Inc. in Peoria, Ill., as a fellow in the Secretary of Defense Corporate Fellows Program. "I am tired, and it's just been so grueling, a two-year fight," Wagenaar said. "A lot of my immediate energy was spent fighting the normal bureaucratic rules, which are great in peacetime, terrible in an emergency." Much of the public relations duty has fallen to the two colonels, who directly oversee the manmade waterways that cut through the metropolitan area and leave it acutely vulnerable to hurricane surges. Bedey, in charge of the most intensely scrutinized levee structures and blessed with a guy-next-door likeability, has, to some extent, stolen the show. While Wagenaar's weariness is visible, Bedey seems to stand slightly above the fray, sometimes wearing a bemused expression or indulging in jokey asides. He powers through the long days on a diet of coffee and cigarettes, rarely stopping for lunch, chauffeured from appointment to appointment in a white Chevy Trailblazer by a public relations official. Slogans, like "shaping today and securing tomorrow," come readily to him, and he repeats them with the conviction of a football coach, a skill perhaps learned during his days as a high school star in Hamilton, Mont., and then an offensive guard at Montana State University. Bedey was pulled prematurely from Omaha normally a three-year posting to fill the new position of HPO commander, which he assumed almost exactly a year ago. The unusual circumstances of his call-to-duty have given him a sense of mission above and beyond the normal motivation to prevent a disaster like Katrina from happening again. "It's certainly a challenge, but life is made of challenges. This is a very, very important mission. The No.Â¤1 domestic priority mission in the Corps of Engineers is the hurricane recovery effort. The only thing that overshadows it is the global war on terror," Bedey said. The public presentations are only a streamlined distillation of Bedey's technical work with fellow engineers about how to solve the flood protection problems for which even the billions of dollars allocated by Congress after Katrina may not be enough. His crew has spent much of its energy on temporary solutions until the specifics of the plan for protection against a once-in-a-100-year storm are ironed out. In the end, success on both the technical and PR fronts is vital to the corps, which, no matter what it accomplishes in the present, will always be dogged by the enormity of its past failures. "You can build stuff, but if you don't have strong relationships, you will not be seen as good as you should be," Bedey said. "On the other hand, if you're great at relationships but you can't get anything done, you're like the guy who, you'd like to get a beer with John, play golf with John, but you'd never let John touch your car, because he's the worst mechanic." Bedey's long commute on the Causeway from his home off Brewster Road near Madisonville is an opportunity to catch up on work-related phone business. Yet he manages to make it back across the lake twice a week in time for his 13-year-old son's baseball games. His two older children attend Mandeville High, and his wife, Amy, is studying for degrees in English and psychology. On weekends, Bedey mows his one-acre plot just like any other suburban dad. Like most Army officers, Bedey has lived all over the map. During a stint in Pakistan while studying for a second master's degree in defense and strategic studies (his first is in construction engineering), he learned to cook biryani and chicken tikka. Since then, the South Asian restaurants stateside have paled in comparison with the real thing. But Bedey has landed in the right place to engage in one of his favorite hobbies -- fishing. His younger son is catching on, too, hooking two large redfish at one of his father's work stomping grounds, the MR-GO. On a clear, windy Friday in late May, Bedey took officials from St. Bernard Parish on a boat tour of the MR-GO. Flanking the waterway were levees of high-quality Mississippi clay to replace the slipshod ones that were almost obliterated by the storm. The slopes, covered with rye or Bermuda grass to increase stability, rose 20 feet above the water -- a big improvement over pre-storm levels but still short of the ideal of 24 feet or higher. While the tour was an illustration of progress made, it was also permeated with regret for a disaster that might have been prevented. If the levees had been in their current condition when Katrina hit, they might have prevented the destruction of St. Bernard Parish, said Councilman Craig Taffaro. Speaking to the officials on the boat, Bedey alluded to the possible closure of the MR-GO, which St. Bernard residents have long advocated, and pointed out the continued vulnerabilities of the Industrial Canal, which he termed the flood protection system's Achilles' heel. In an earlier interview, Councilman Joey DiFatta said he is happy that the corps seems to be making progress since the hurricane but that the same level of infrastructure investment and public outreach should have been in place years ago. He views Bedey as representative of the new corps -- more aggressive in attacking problems and more conscious of local residents' needs. "Everyone is now looking extremely closely at everything they do, making sure everything they do is proper, which is good, and that's the way it should have been for years and years," DiFatta said. "Maybe now we're getting the level of participation in the corps that we should have been getting for the last 50 years." Cindy Chang can be reached at cchang@timespicayune.com or (985) 898-4816. I LOVE READING STORIES LIKE THIS BECAUSE YOU FIND OUT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL PERSONALITY OUTSIDE OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING AND FIND OUT THAT THEY ARE HUMANS JUST LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO READ THESE ARTICLES. I BELIEVE THAT THE LEVEES ARE STRONGER THAN THEY WERE IN JULY 2005 AND THE CORPS IS MAKING GREAT STRIDES IN BRINGING THE LEVEES BACK TO PRE-KATRINA STRENGTH AND I DON'T MEAN PRE-KATRINA STRENGTH AS IN AUGUST 28, 2005 CONDITION I MEAN LONG BEFORE KATRINA WHEN THE LEVEES WERE AT THEIR STRONGEST BEFORE THEY STARTED WEAKENING. PEOPLE WILL NEVER TRUST THE CORPS JUST BECAUSE THE IMAGES DURING THAT IMMEDIATE AFTERMATH WILL ALWAYS BE STUCK IN THE BACK OF PEOPLES MINDS AND THEY WILL REMEMBER HOW THE CORPS FAILED PEOPLE LONG BEFORE THE LEVEES BROKE BUT HOW MANY TIMES BEFORE HE LEVEES BROKE DID PEOPLE READ DAILY NEWS ABOUT WORK ON LEVEES AND HOW MANY TIMES BEFORE THE LEVEES BROKE DID THE SUBJECT OF LEVEES BECOME HOT TOPICS DURING LEGISLATIVE SESSIONS AND THE TOPIC OF THOSE IN CONGRESS. THE CORPS HAS DONE ABOUT 4 OR 5 YEARS WORTH OF WORK IN 21 MONTHS BUT MORE STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE OBVIOUSLY BUT FOR THE FIRST TIME THEY ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. TO ALL THE WORK BEING DONE I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE CORPS OF ENGINEERS FOR THE AROUND THE CLOCK WORK BEING DONE ON THE LEVEES SINCE 8/29/05, THEY COULD HAVE EASILY TOOK THE "LIGHTENING DOESN STRIKE TWICE" APPROACH AND HALF ASSES WITH THE LEVEES BUT THEY FINALLY DOING THEIR JOBS. TO THE MANY CORPS CRITICS SUCH AS IVOR VAN HEERDEN AND ROBERT BEA, I THANK THEM FOR ASKING THE TOUGH QUESIONS THAT ORDINARY CITIZENS WOULDN'T ASK AND GETTING ANSWERS AND RESULTS FROM THE CORPS. HOPEFULLY WE GET A BREAK DURING THIS HURRICANE SEASON BECAUSE THE MORE HURRICANE SEASONS THAT PAST WITH LITTLE TO NO ACTIVITY, THE LESS AND LESS LIKELY THE FAILURES OF KATRINA ARE GOING TO BE REPEATED. Posted on 06/03/07 at 12:55AM I like the way Col. Bedey says "you can build stuff, but if you don't have strong relationships, you will not be seen as good as you should be". Nevermind the PR Col. Bedey, just "build stuff". I promise the people of New Orleans will be impressed. Our lives have literally been reduced to slogans-"Task Force Hope" and "Global War on Terror". We are not impressed by these! I prefer "Task Force Can Do" and "Rebuild American Cities First". Col. Wagenaar's remarks about the flooded site of New Orleans, "I didn't know how it had gotten under water. I couldn't believe it. It sucked the air out of me" are the first emotional response I have heard from anyone in the Corp. Thank you Col. Wagenaar! As for myself, I think I would have thrown up as people do when they come across a dead body that has deteriorated. And then I would have committed suicide as many do who are responsible for such an unrepairable mistake and the recrimination that follows. I'm sure no one person is responsible for the fate of New Orleans in August, 2005, but the above should have been their feelings if there were just one person responsible. As for the director of "Task Force Hope", Karen Durham-Agilera, living in New Orleans is a step in the right direction, but if she really wants to take a leap she could live on Grande Isle with the ultimate goal of coastal restoration. The United States loves to spend money on the military and I can only hope that hurricane protection for the city of New Orleans is no exception. The 7 billion appropriated thus far is not a drop in the bucket according to an article written by Newt Guinghrich posted in the Times Picayunne after Katrina. He estimated 40 billion over 30 years-Yes, 30 years. Rome wasn't built in a day and neither will the restoration of New Orleans and its coastline. If the people of New Orleans can see the committment ('building stuff') from the federal government, they will return and rebuild. Many are rebuilding with doubts of this committment. If ever there was a time to "Stay the Course", it is now. Go lite on the coffee and cigarettes Col. Bedet, we are here for the long haul. If the Industrial Canal is the Achilles heel of the flood protection system of New Orleans, we should be watching closely what is done with that, and of course, the MRGO. This brings me to an interesting point. Councilman Joey Defatta states that we should be "making sure everything they do is proper". But what is "proper"? And who is responsible for overseaing the Corp activities for the city of New Orleans Miss Chang? Posted on 06/03/07 at 2:49AM IT WILL TAKE MORE than a publicity campaign to repair the Corps(e)'s image. It will take repayment to all victims of their criminal incompetence. Posted on 06/03/07 at 6:59AM Ms. Chang are you a reporter or a press agent for Colonel Bedey? Do you really think that the victims of the Corp of Engineers care about Bedey's long commute. Many are still commuting to get back to their homes that were devasated by the Corp. Those victims could care less about Bedey's personal life. There lives and homes have been devastated beyond repair. Ms. Chang to paraphrase a former U.S. Senator, " I have met real newspaper reporters Ms. Chang, and you are definitely not a reporter by any stretch of the imagination. " Posted on 06/03/07 at 10:36PM Thanks so much for this great article. Your "reporting" style is fabulous. You captured a great man very well. COL Bedey is the right man for this tough job and the Corps isn't in the PR business. They are here to do their job - nothing else. The fact that he is a "stand up guy" who is also super-intelligent and personable makes New Orleans fortunate to have such a great person in his position. Stop being bitter NOLA, cut the Corps some slack. Don't blame one soldier doing his job and one reporter highlighting a great soldier for your losses. Posted on 06/04/07 at 6:47AM I am glad to see the Corp can provide two cheer leaders for Mr. Bedey. He is no great man. He is part of the gang of incompetents who helped to destroy south louisiana with there criminal levee design. If you ask the people who are still living through this virtual nightmare about Mr. Bedey, they would tell you that you and Mr. Bedey can kiss their a**.

The boys are learning tricks with their roller sneakers. &#40;Stephanie Diani, Chicago Tribune/Newscom&#41; ABC News Medical Unit Even if one hasn't had firsthand experience zipping across sidewalks on a pair of shoes with wheels in the heels, most everyone is familiar with "heeling," as the activity is called. Now, doctors are worried that the footwear may put young users at increased risk of sprains and fractures, and a new study may further justify their fears. Docs Say Roller Sneakers Injuring Kids Overuse sports injuries often seen in kids Kids' Soccer Injuries Analyzed According to a study released today in the current issue of the journal Pediatrics, 67 children were treated for injuries from footwear known as Heelys and similar products at Temple Street Children's University Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, over a 10-week period last summer. "The results are pretty amazing," says study author Dr. Mihai Vioreanu, adding that the unnatural balance needed to successfully pilot the shoes likely contributes to injuries. "This balanced position with a tendency of the body to fall backwards explains the risk of falling," he says. The study isn't the first red flag that has been raised over the footwear. According to The Associated Press, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported last week that one death and at least 64 roller-shoe injuries could be blamed on the trendy footwear. And the injuries aren't just in Ireland. In recent years, doctors in Korea, Singapore, the United States and other countries have raised concerns about the shoes and the injuries they may be causing. All of this comes at a time when the products have already sparked an international craze. Heelys Inc., the company that manufactures the Heelys brand footwear, says it has shipped more than 10 million pairs of the wheeled footwear since its introduction in 2000. Protective Gear Usually Neglected The company maintains that its products are safe. Last April, Heelys Inc. announced that a study using Consumer Product Safety Commission data on product-related injuries from January 2001 through September 2006 confirmed that the use of the footwear was significantly safer than bicycling, skateboarding, basketball, soccer and even tennis.

Over 50 of the chemicals it contains are known to cause cancer in human beings. Hundreds of studies provide conclusive evidence that it causes other serious diseases, such as heart disease and asthma. Globally, 700 million children, or almost half the world's children, breathe air polluted by tobacco smoke. Moreover, exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke causes 2.8% of all lung cancer. In the European Union in 2002, some 80 000 people are estimated to have died from conditions related to second-hand tobacco smoke. "Over the last three years, our WHO European Region has experienced dramatic improvements in protecting its citizens from the dangers of second-hand tobacco smoke. Yet with 79% of 13-15-year-olds recently surveyed in 25 countries in the Region exposed to second-hand tobacco smoke at least once a week, more needs to be done to protect the vulnerable in our society," says Dr Marc Danzon, WHO Regional Director for Europe. Ensuring that an environment is 100% smoke free is the only effective protection. Ventilation systems cannot remove all particulate matter or toxic gases, and many particles are inhaled or deposited on clothing, furniture, walls and ceilings before they can be removed. Regulations on smoking in public places are increasing throughout the WHO European Region: 70% of countries ban smoking in health care establishments and schools, and 60% ban smoking in government facilities, workplaces and cultural institutions. Recently the focus has been on the hospitality sector, beginning with the smoking ban in pubs, bars and restaurants introduced in Ireland in March 2004. Since 2002, 20 countries in the Region have strengthened their legislation on smoking in restaurants, pubs and bars, 7 through bans and several others by introducing restrictions. Countries with extensive bans on smoking in public areas have seen very high levels of compliance, and popular support for the bans has tended to increase once they are in force. For example, a year after smoking was banned in bars and restaurants in Italy, 9 out of 10 people were in favour of the ban and 87% considered that it was well respected. Similar findings have been reported from Ireland, Norway and Sweden. Public service announcements broadcast on television and in cinemas are a powerful way of ensuring that an important health message reaches the general public. The WHO Regional Office for Europe has compiled a unique showcase of some of the most recent announcements on tobacco control in the European Region. In addition, the Regional Office released The European tobacco control report 2007 on the fifth anniversary of the Warsaw Declaration for a Tobacco-Free Europe; the report provides information on smoking-related issues throughout the European Region. Every year, WHO rewards individuals and organizations for their remarkable commitment and contributions to work for a tobacco-free Europe.

"I've lived in this state of constant fear and anxiety and exhaustion for a week now, and to think that someone else is now feeling that, I wouldn't want anyone to feel that way. It's awful," Andrew Speaker, speaking through a face mask, told ABC's "Good Morning America" from his hospital room in Denver. In this image taken from video and released by ABC, tuberculosis patient Andrew Speaker meets with "Good Morning America" co-host Diane Sawyer at the National Jewish Research Center in Denver, Colo., where Speaker is receiving treatment. Speaker, who is quarantined at the hospital, is the first infected person to be quarantined by the U.S. government since 1963. (AP Photo/ABC) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Meanwhile, questions arose as to whether the wedding even took place. The mayor of the island of Santorini in Greece, Angelos Rousso, told The Associated Press: "There was no wedding. They came for a marriage but they did not have the required papers." He said the couple stayed in a hotel for three days and then left. In Denver, Speaker's doctors said that he could be in the hospital for up to two months, and that if antibiotics fail to knock out the extremely drug-resistant infection, he may have to undergo surgery to remove infected lung tissue, about the size of a tennis ball. Surgery to remove pieces of the lung was more common before the advent of sophisticated drugs in the 1960s. But it is coming back as a treatment because of the development of strains resistant to those drugs. Speaker is the first infected person quarantined by the U.S. government since 1963. In the TV interview, Speaker, wearing street clothes, repeatedly apologized to the dozens of airline passengers and crew members now anxiously awaiting the results of their TB tests. "I don't expect for people to ever forgive me. I just hope that they understand that I truly never meant to put them in harm," he said, his voice cracking. Health officials have contacted 74 of the 310 U.S. citizens who were on the May 12 Air France flight that Speaker and his fiancee took to Paris, the CDC said. That count includes all 26 who sat in the five-row area around Speaker _ the ones considered at greatest risk. None is exhibiting symptoms, CDC officials said. Speaker, 31, said he, his doctors and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention all knew he had TB that was resistant to some drugs before he flew to Europe for his wedding and honeymoon last month. But he said he was advised at the time by Fulton County, Ga., health authorities that he was not contagious or a danger to anyone. Officials told him they would prefer he didn't fly, but no one ordered him not to, he said. Speaker said his father, also a lawyer, taped that meeting. "My father said, 'OK, now are you saying, prefer not to go on the trip because he's a risk to anybody, or are you simply saying that to cover yourself?' And they said, 'We have to tell you that to cover ourself, but he's not a risk,'" Speaker said.

The doctors consider this finding as a breakthrough in the field of medicine as this is the first drug that has provided some sort of advancement in the search for a liver cancer cure considering there had been 100 unsuccessful trials of drugs for liver cancer in the last 30 years. But the results would not apply to other forms of liver cancer or to cancers originated elsewhere in the body like lung or breast and then spread to the liver. Liver tumors are generally removed surgically, if possible, or are otherwise subjected to radiation or chemotherapy. The study led by Joseph Llovet, a liver cancer specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, involved 602 patients suffering from the most common form of malignant liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a cancer starting during adulthood in cells in the liver and is also called adult primary liver cancer. Primary liver cancer is different from cancer that has metastasized (spread) from another place in the body to the liver. The signs and symptoms of this cancer may include a hard lump just below the rib cage on the right side (from swelling of the liver), discomfort in the upper abdomen on the right side, pain around the right shoulder blade, or yellowing of the skin (jaundice). âWe did not have anything for these patients,â said Dr. Josep M. Llovet. âNow we have an effective drug that prolongs survival. For the first time, we have a drug that is working.'' said Llovet. The patients under the study were divided randomly and were either given placebos or Nexavar, also called sorafenib, along with the standard therapy. After the study concluded it was noticed that the cancer cells in patients treated with Nexavar spread slowly (28 weeks) as compared to those treated with placebos (12 weeks) and as a result the former subjects lived a median time of 10.7 months compared with 7.9 months for patients on a placebo. Nexavar is taken as an oral pill and is targeted to blocks proteins on cells, to stop tumor cells from proliferating and cut off the blood supply to tumors. Side effects after consuming Nexavar included diarrhea in about 11% of the patients, swelling in hands and feet in another 8%, skin rash and hypertension. The patients suffering with kidney cancer experienced similar side effects. The Californian biotechnology company based in Emeryville, Onyx Pharmaceuticals and German Pharmaceutical company, Bayer have already attained FDAâs approval for the drug as a cure for kidney cancer on December 20, 2005 and are now headed to apply for a regulatory approval to sell it as a drug for liver cancer too that affects the lives of around 17,000 Americans every year. According to Lovet the drug however didnât meet a pre-specified goal for improving the quality of life. It is also expensive and costs around $4,500 a month. Apart from liver cancer it is also being studied in melanoma, lung and breast cancers. Nexavar containing the active ingredient sorafenib is a type of medicine called a multikinase inhibitor which works by interfering in the working and growth of certain cancer cells which grow abnormally due to enzymes called kinases. Liver cancer is associated with Hepatitis B and C infection and is called Hepatic tumor which is growth on or in the liver. This growth can be malignant (cancerous) or benign. Hepatocellular carcinoma is potentially curable by surgery but it only helps a small fraction of people who have localized disease. Laparoscopy may detect metastatic disease, tumor in both lobes of the liver, or an inadequate liver remnant, and avoid the need for open surgery to explore the liver. In some parts of the world, Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is very common but it is still relatively uncommon in the US although it is rising every year due to the increasing incidence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. People suffering from cirrhosis are more likely to develop adult primary liver cancer. People who have both hepatitis B and hepatitis C may be at a higher risk if they consume more than 3 oz. (80 grams) of alcohol a day. A first-degree relative with hepatocellular carcinoma also increases the risk. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

According to reports, the four accused people billed a health insurance company for 20 brain surgeries that never even took place, some of which took place on the same person on multiple occasions. New York-based Group Health Incorporated is the name of the health insurance company who was taken for a ride by a 36-year-old from New York City who claimed nine brain surgeries for himself, along with his wife and two sons. The family supposedly billed the insurance company for a total of $142,268, and based on the claims, they paid more than $300,000 in reimbursements. Ilene Margolin, a spokeswoman for GHI, stated that the company first noticed that there was something wrong when internal investigators noticed the number of unusual claims, before turning over their findings to the government. Currently the 36-year-old man is still at large and authorities are looking for him. Click Here to Join the Discussion! at 2007-06-02 21:48 | Copyright Â© 2006 DogFlu.Ca All rights reserved.
http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/15-3&fd=R&url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/02/nyregion/02brain.html&cid=1116897614&ei=iIBkRoWhMY-oqgPRnJWcBg Prosecutors Say Insurer Was Billed for Brain Surgery That Never Occurred - New York Times Prosecutors Say Insurer Was Billed for Brain Surgery That Never Occurred Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: June 2, 2007 It may have been the nine brain operations that Stanley Canella claimed that he, his wife and their two sons had from April 2003 to September 2006 that piqued the interest of federal investigators. Then again, it may have been that all four members of the family received insurance reimbursements for the same surgery on the same brain. Federal prosecutors did not discuss yesterday how they came to charge Mr. Canella and three other people with bilking an insurance company out of about $300,000 with falsified post-operative reports. They did say that although the four defendants had billed the company for 20 brain operations, none had been performed. Mr. Canella, 36, remained at large yesterday. He faces charges of mail and health-care fraud, officials said. His three co-defendants &#151; Charles Pritchett, 39, of Mount Vernon, N.Y.; Dorothy L. Smith, 42, of Manhattan; and Michael Biscotti, 37, of Staten Island &#151; were in custody and likely to be arraigned next week. Officials declined to describe the relationships of the four defendants. Because they had not yet been arraigned, it was unclear whether they had hired lawyers. The scheme began on April 28, 2003, prosecutors say, when Mr. Pritchett, a billing technician at a medical billing company in Hawthorne, N.Y, cracked into his company&#8217;s computers. He gained access to the insurance claims and post-operative reports for two patients who had visited a Manhattan neurosurgeon, prosecutors say. Using the forms as a template, Mr. Pritchett then simply plugged in the names, ages, addresses and similar information for the Canellas, the Smiths, and Mr. Biscotti and his wife, according to a federal indictment issued yesterday. The forms were sent to Group Health Inc., a Manhattan insurance carrier, prosecutors said. From April 2003 to September 2006, Mr. Canella received $142,268 in reimbursements from Group Health, the indictment says. This was for nine supposed operations for the various members of his family &#151;one of which Mr. Canella was accused of billing for three separate times, prosecutors say. Ms. Smith also billed &#151; and received money &#151; for nine brain operations for herself and her family, prosecutors say. She is charged with having defrauded Group Health of $131,397. Mr. Biscotti got a lesser sum, $31,041, for operations that he and wife had supposedly undergone, prosecutors say. Mr. Pritchett faces a maximum penalty of 90 years in prison if convicted. The others face maximum sentences of 30 years. Ilene Margolin, a spokeswoman for Group Health, said it was the company&#8217;s own internal investigators who first noticed something awry in the defendants&#8217; claims. The company then turned its findings over to the government. &#8220;We&#8217;re glad the United States attorney&#8217;s office was able to make a case,&#8221; she said.

Four of 10 patients had their tumors shrink during a study, with minimal side effects, when taking a version of Herceptin linked to chemical toxins, researchers said at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. The combination is in the first of three phases generally needed for U.S. marketing approval. Genentech said its so-called `armed&#39; antibody will advance into a second-stage trial. One analyst said the more-potent form could generate $1.5 billion on its own, if approved by U.S. regulators. The currently marketed product had $1.2 billion in sales in 2006. ``This is the most exciting thing to me that we are doing,&#39;&#39; said Pamela Klein, Genentech&#39;s vice president of clinical hematology and oncology, in an interview yesterday. In April, when Genentech first announced it was testing the combination, analyst Geoffrey Porges of Sanford Bernstein & Co. in New York said the charged-up version may increase peak annual sales to $1.6 billion. Genentech makes the combination with ImmunoGen Inc. of Cambridge, Massachusetts, a partner that provides linking technology for the drug. In April, when Genentech first announced it was testing the combination, analyst Geoffrey Porges of Sanford Bernstein & Co. in New York said the charged-up version may increase peak annual sales to $1.6 billion. ImmunoGen&#39;s shares rose 2 cents to $5.94 at 4:00 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. The shares of South San Francisco based Genentech fell $1.55, or 2 percent, to $77.95 at 4:01 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The study was designed to measure safety, and the drug was generally well-tolerated, Klein said. No serious heart damage was seen, the most worrisome potential side effect, Klein said. The patients in the study were difficult to treat, and Klein said she didn&#39;t expect to see such a tumor response. She cautioned that the company needs to do further studies in a larger patient population, and has ``much work to do.&#39;&#39; The treatment binds tumor-killing chemicals to Herceptin, causing fewer side effects by attacking cancer cells and mostly leaving normal tissue alone. The research, presented late yesterday, may give Genentech a way to sell its standard Herceptin for early forms of breast cancer, and then provide the more potent therapy after the disease progresses. The strategy may spur new treatment practices for a disease diagnosed in more than 178,000 U.S. women a year. Herceptin had $1.2 billion in sales in 2006, making it Genentech&#39;s third-biggest drug behind cancer therapies Rituxan and Avastin. The drug also adds revenue for Basel, Switzerland- based drugmaker Roche AG, Genentech&#39;s largest shareholder. The more potent version could also help Genentech fend off competition from GlaxoSmithKline Plc.&#39;s Tykerb, analysts said. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the rival drug, which also targets HER-2 proteins, in March. About one-fourth of breast cancer patients have tumors that carry excess amounts of HER-2 protein, the protein that Herceptin, an antibody drug, is designed to target, Genentech says. The drug works by blocking HER-2 positive cancer cells from dividing and growing. The new technology offers a different approach to earlier efforts that attached radiation to antibodies such as Herceptin, instead of toxic chemicals. Those approaches struggled commercially because oncologists must collaborate with nuclear medicine specialists, doctors say. Included in the old approach is Biogen Idec Inc.&#39;s radiation-antibody combination Zevalin, which recorded $16.4 million in sales in its fourth year on the market. The company is now seeking to divest that drug, according to the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company&#39;s annual report with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Past combinations have failed because the toxins either snapped off in the blood before reaching the tumors or hit healthy cells on the way, causing side effects. Seattle Genetics, another collaborator of Genentech, says it has developed new synthetic linkers designed to remain stable in the blood, yet let go of its toxic payload inside tumors. ImmunoGen has worked on the linking technology since it was founded in 1981. The company doesn&#39;t yet have a marketed drug, or one in the final stage of testing, according to its Web site.

Those who took Nexavar in the trial lived a median time of 10.7 months compared with 7.9 months for patients on a placebo, according to research presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago. The difference meant patients lived 44 percent longer, researchers said. Onyx, based in Emeryville, California, and its marketing partner, Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer, say they plan to submit the results to U.S. and European regulators imminently, and hope to have approval in 2008. The medicine would be a new option against a disease that kills almost 17,000 Americans yearly while increasing Nexavar sales from $165 million last year. Currently, Nexavar is approved to treat kidney cancer. ``The results of this trial are a breakthrough in the management of this disease,&#39;&#39; said Joseph Llovet, a liver cancer specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, and lead author of the study, in a telephone interview. ``For the first time, we have a drug that is working.&#39;&#39; The data should make Nexavar the new standard of care for inoperable liver cancer, said analyst Phil Nadeau of Cowen & Company, in a May 21 note. It will remain so ``for the next several years,&#39;&#39; because rivals are still in early stages of development, he wrote. The shares of Onyx, based in Emeryville, California, rose $2.64 to $33.52 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market composite trading. Earlier, the stock reached $34. Bayer&#39;s shares closed 15 cents higher at 54.48 euros in Frankfurt. Onyx shares have almost tripled this year, and are the best-performing on the Nasdaq Biotechnology Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The study, in 602 patients, showed Nexavar is the first to show improved survival against liver cancer among about 100 that have completed involving other drugs over 30 years, Llovet said in an interview. Patients who have liver tumors now have them surgically removed if possible, or have radiation or chemotherapy delivered directly to the organ, researchers said. The most common side effects with Nexavar were diarrhea in 11 percent of patients, and swelling in the hands and feet for 8 percent of patients, researchers said. Side effects were similar to those for patients with kidney cancer, and the drug was ``very well tolerated,&#39;&#39; compared with chemotherapy, Llovet said. Researchers found the drug worked by slowing the spread of the disease. It took a median of 28 weeks before Nexavar patients had their disease spread, compared with 12 weeks for those on placebo, the study found. The drug didn&#39;t meet a pre-specified goal for improving quality of life, Llovet said. Nexavar is taken as an oral pill. It is a targeted therapy, which blocks proteins on cells, to stop tumor cells from proliferating and cut off the blood supply to tumors. ``For a new drug in the most advanced form of liver cancer, this is quite an impressive gain,&#39;&#39; said Nancy Davidson, an oncologist at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center in Baltimore, in a news conference. The liver cancer trial is one of 45 Nexavar studies being highlighted at the cancer meeting in Chicago, said Hollings Renton, Onyx&#39;s Chief Executive Officer, in a telephone interview. Nexavar represents part of the company&#39;s strategy to pick a few tough-to-treat tumors, establish effectiveness and branch out by adding it in combinations with other therapies. The drug is also being studied in melanoma, lung and breast cancers. ``We have been successful beyond our wildest dreams,&#39;&#39; Renton said. Nexavar was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in December 2005 for patients with advanced kidney cancer. The drug competes with Pfizer Inc.&#39;s Sutent, and costs users about $4,500 a month, the company has said. Onyx and Bayer each take half the profits from Nexavar worldwide, with the exception of Japan, where Bayer takes a greater share, Renton said. The commercial opportunity may be greater in Europe, where the disease is more than twice as common as in the U.S., Renton said. About 19,160 new cases of liver cancer will be diagnosed in the U.S. this year, with about 70 percent of them being men, according to the American Cancer Society. Liver cancer killed an estimated 598,000 people worldwide in 2002, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, in Lyon, France. Liver cancer is associated with Hepatitis B and C infection, and alcoholism, said Ghassan Abou-Alfa, a liver cancer specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering in New York, in an interview. More people may get the disease in the future because studies show obesity may play a role, he said. Some researchers believe the disease is difficult to treat because damaged livers can&#39;t tolerate enough chemotherapy, or that the liver might be breaking down the drug before it can work, he said. Nexavar may be working where others failed, because it works by blocking proteins involved in tumor proliferation, and that supply blood and nutrients to cancer cells, he said.

The survivors carried pink, white and purple balloons as family and team members clapped and cheered in honor of their victories. Caregivers and children joined their parents and loved ones for a second lap. The survivors then went outside to release their balloons. A proud father carried survivor Isaac Newberry, 3-years-old, around the track. Suzy Shoemaker, Isaac&#8217;s aunt, said he was diagnosed with cancer when he was 1. &#8220;He&#8217;s cancer-free right now,&#8221; she said. Shoemaker, in charge of survivorship for the Relay for Life Committee, said more than 10 million people have battled cancer and survived. &#8220;This is the main reason we do Relay for Life,&#8221; she said. &#8220;From the day these people heard, &#8216;You have cancer,&#8217; they have been survivors.&#8221; She said the event was a night for people who have shared the same experiences to console and comfort each other. The Edmond Firefighters Association was one of two teams to raise more than $5,000 for the event. Firefighter Brad Powell said this is their first year to participate. &#8220;One of our firefighters just recovered 11 months ago and he&#8217;s been involved with this and we came out to support him,&#8221; Powell said. During the past four years, the Crusaders, another team, has raised a total of about $10,000 for Relay for Life. &#8220;My dad died of cancer 10 years ago,&#8221; said team captain Carrie Loper. She said the team is not representing a business or organization but represents a group of friends who have lost a total of three family members. &#8220;That&#8217;s what brought us together,&#8221; Loper said. While teams honored survivors and those who have died from cancer, many individual survivors also celebrated. Survivor David Dean, 77, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2002. He said the cancer measured 11.5 on a PSA before treatment and 0.29 after. &#8220;I was treated with radiation for 25 days,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I went five days a week for five weeks.&#8221; He said the hardest challenge of radiation for him was how frequently he had to go to the bathroom. He said he used to wake up three or four times a night to use the bathroom and now he frequently sleeps through the entire night. &#8220;There are just a lot of people out there who have cancer and are going to have cancer,&#8221; Dean said. Robbie Maroney is a second-year survivor of breast cancer. &#8220;(Relay for Life) is really important for me because of the progress they made,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I look forward to the day that there is no longer breast cancer.&#8221; To help raise more funds for Edmond Relay for Life, Mindy Lee sold purple and white stovepipe hats with the word &#8220;Hope&#8221; etched into them. Lee said the woman who created the hats lives in Tennessee and lost her sister and son to cancer. She created them with the intent that all proceeds be donated to Relay for Life fundraisers across the nation. Relay for Life is a fundraiser organized and created by the American Cancer Society. Deer Creek Rose Union Elementary students designed paper bags for luminaries. The bags were decorated to follow this year&#8217;s Relay for Life theme of &#8220;Around the World.&#8221; &#8220;Luminaries are to honor those who are fighting cancer or in remission and you buy them in memory of or in honor of someone,&#8221; said Jamie Nikkel, committee member. At 10 p.m., the luminaries were lit and the name for which each bag was purchased was read. The survivors then walked a lap of silence. Shoemaker said the Edmond Relay for Life raised a little more than $87,000, surpassing its $85,000 goal. Click to discuss this story with other readers on our forums.

RELATED STORIES & LINKS Pure Horserace: Obama Adds Heft Democratic Candidate's Health Care Plan May Add Substance To Campaign And Quiet Some Critics Obama Unveils Universal Health Care Plan Government, Businesses And Consumers Would Share The Program's Cost (Page 1 of 2) Like so many in the Democratic Party, Obama's advisers remember all too well how excessive ambition killed the Clinton plan politically. They don't want to make that mistake again. This column was written by In Iowa on Tuesday, when Senator Barack Obama gave a speech about health care, he started by introducing Amy Chicos and telling her story. It seems that Amy and her husband, Lane, run a small business providing broadband Internet access to their small town. Twenty years ago, Lane was diagnosed with cancer  and ended up losing a lung, a leg bone, and part of his hip. He's in complete remission now, which is the good news. But, as a cancer survivor, he has sky high insurance premiums. The Chicos now pay 40 percent of their income for health insurance. They struggle to pay for the basic necessities, like food and gas. They have no savings, either  just huge credit card debt and the prospect of bankruptcy looming in the near future. After recounting this saga, Obama suggested that "This is not who we are. And this is not who we have to be." He then proceeded to unveil a plan designed to help the Chicos and the millions of other Americans who face financial hardship because of medical bills  by reducing the cost of medicine and by helping people to pay for insurance. Exactly how many people would he help and by how much? Is his proposed scheme the best possible way to achieve that? Those are two important questions, but before we get to them let's step back for a moment. In the context of a primary campaign, with policy proposals flying left and right, it's easy to forget the simple message all voters should take away  particularly if Barack Obama really does end up as the Democratic nominee for president. That message is this: He thinks it's wrong that people have to go through what the Chicos have gone through. He thinks society has an obligation to fix that problem. And he's got a plan that would help accomplish this. These are all good things  and, at least relative to whatever Republican he runs against in 2008, they more than recommend him for the job. Still, it is not November 2008 yet. It's May 2007  at the early stages of the presidential primaries, when we have the luxury of deciding between multiple candidates. And, while proposals like these are not the sole basis on which to make decisions about who we would like our parties to nominate, they offer us a lot of valuable insights. Indeed, when evaluating a health care proposal like the one Obama put out on Tuesday, the plan's details matter most for what they tell us about the candidate who settled upon them. All policy decisions require making trade-offs. So what trade-offs has the candidate made? What does that reveal about his priorities and political instincts? What can we discern about his management style? And does the package as a whole suggest this is somebody who knows how to sell an idea? Here is where the verdict on Obama's plan  or, more accurately, Obama  is mixed. The best thing you can say about his plan is that he places a great deal of emphasis on actually making medical care less expensive by eliminating waste. His initiatives for doing this  like stressing disease management, investing in information technology, and creating an independent institute to evaluate the effectiveness of treatments  are detailed and well-thought out. This reflects, among other things, the fact that Obama has surrounded himself with some of the leading experts in this field, like economist David Cutler and physician David Blumenthal. But what about his approach to expanding coverage? From afar, it looks a lot like the plan already put forth by former Senator John Edwards. Rather than provide all Americans with basic insurance from the government  the way a single-payer system would  Obama has opted to leave current health insurance arrangements in place. His plan assumes that most people who already have private health insurance will hold onto that coverage. As for the people who don't have insurance  or might lose it sometime in the future  Obama would offer several alternatives. Some people would qualify for coverage under expanded safety-net programs like Medicaid. Others would have the opportunity to buy coverage through a new purchasing pool that Obama would create, choosing between closely regulated private insurance plans or a new, government-run program that Obama would offer as an alternative. (Small businesses could also buy into the government-run plan.) Along the way, Obama would throw in subsidies  a lot of them, as a matter of fact  to help people who struggle with medical bills pay for their insurance. This is all fine and good. There's an undeniable political logic to increasing coverage this way: You're telling people who don't have insurance they'll finally have a realistic chance to get it. And you're telling people who do have health insurance they don't have to feel threatened in any way  they'll get to keep what they already have, only it will be cheaper (because of all the money Obama would save through new efficiencies). But there are some differences between what Obama and Edwards have proposed. And by far the biggest, most important one is the fact that Edwards has a "mandate" in his plan: He would require every single American to get insurance. That means his plan is truly "universal." Obama says he, too, is committed to covering everybody by 2012. And he has a mandate that all children get insurance. But there is no similar mandate on adults. There is, in other words, no requirement that every adult American have health insurance. And that means his plan is not universal  at least not in the same sense that Edwards and his advisers mean it. Why does this matter? Obama's advisers, for what it's worth, think it doesn't. Not much, anyway. They believe that their initiative will help cover most Americans within two or three years.

In addition, a Vietnamese health official said at least two other patients are suspected of having the disease, the reports said. Vietnamese media Saturday quoted Dr. Tran Duc Hien, director of the Hospital for Tropical Diseases in Hanoi, as saying that an employee at a slaughterhouse in the city had tested positive for the avian flu virus. The man, whom authorities are referring to only by his first initial, T., had reported to a health station on May 19, complaining of breathing difficulties, a runny nose and a persistent chill. Hien said T. remains in treatment at the Hospital for Tropical Diseases. Vietnam's other confirmed case, a 30-year-old man from Vinh Phuc province who tested positive for H5N1 on May 20 after killing the chickens for a friend's wedding, is being treated at Hanoi's Bach Mai Hospital. That patient has recovered and will be released soon, according to doctors. "He's now much better," Dr. Tran Thuy Hanh, acting director of Bach Mai, said Saturday. "Tests have shown that he's negative to H5N1." Hanh also said that besides the two confirmed cases, at least one other patient currently in treatment, and one who died Friday, are suspected of having the disease. Hanh said the patient who died was admitted Thursday night for complications related to gout. After he died the next morning, she said, "the hospital X-rayed him as a precaution, and found that his lungs were completely white." Results of his H5N1 test were not yet available. The second suspected case was also admitted on Thursday. He is a 29-year-old policeman who had taken part in the culling of sick chickens. The latest confirmed case brings the total number of confirmed human cases in Vietnam to 94 since the disease emerged here in late 2003. International health authorities generally regard Vietnam as a success story because of its aggressive efforts to control the disease in animals and to test and treat human cases.

Even on cloudy days, the UVA and UVB rays reach the earth and your skin. Summer time is here and the kids are playing outside for hours each day. Even if they aren't swimming, it is important to think about keeping them safe and healthy while out in the sun. Protection against the sun throughout the early years of life may lessen your child's chance of skin cancer in adulthood. This article will cover some simple facts about the sun's powerful rays, and some simple ways to protect your child this summer! The sun has three main forms of ultraviolet rays that is radiates towards the earth. These rays are essential to the proper function and heating of the earth, but can cause serious damage to our skin. The three types of ultraviolet rays are: UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVA are the most common form of rays that reach the earth. These rays are also emitted from tanning beds to produce a tan on your skin. UVA rays pass through the ozone layer very easily, so they are found in plenty throughout the atmosphere. UVA rays can cause cancer and other aging signs such as wrinkles to your skin. UVB rays are more severe and may cause cancer, cataracts and may even damage your immune system. Melanoma is thought to be linked to sunburns caused by UVB rays before the age of 20. This is just one reason it is vital to protect your children in the sun. UVB rays do not pass through the ozone as easily as UVA rays, so they are less plentiful. The last type of ultraviolet ray the sun emits is UVC rays. UVC rays are very damaging, but the ozone layer does not allow these rays to permeate so, the UVC rays are not able to reach the earth and damage our skin. There are so many ways to protect yourself and your child from the sun's damaging rays. One simple yet effective way is to avoid the heat of the midday. The sun's rays are the strongest from 11am-3pm. Go outside to play in the early morning before the sun has reached the high sky. Afternoon and evening trips to the park or backyard play can be so much fun, and safer for everyone involved. Swimming in the late afternoon may also be more desirable as there may be fewer people at the local swimming pool. It is important to use another form of sun protection when you will be out for longer periods of time and you cannot avoid the heat of the day. One more very effective way to protect children from the sun is to simply cover their skin. Very light clothing may be worn over the child's skin to absorb some of the UV rays from the sun. A beach umbrella is also a great way to provide shade when there is no natural shade available. Tents specially made for the beach, or sunny areas are also very effective to protect your skin from the sun. Even resting in the shade for a bit to allow your skin some recovery time from the sun will help to prevent further damage. Infants should always be placed in a shady spot to prevent the sun from damaging their very fine, sensitive skin. Sunscreen is probably the most used skin protectant. Choose a sunscreen with a high SPF level. The SPF level is a number that indicates the amount of time your child will receive protection from the sunscreen. A SPF level of 30 will give your child 30 minutes of protection from the sun's harmful rays. Sunscreen needs to be applied ahead of time so that the skin can absorb the chemicals that will provide the protection. If your child is swimming or sweating, be sure to choose a sunscreen that is water proof, and apply more often. Water acts like a magnifying glass to the sun's rays and intensifies their strength. It is also very important to protect your child's eyes from the sun. The same rays that may cause skin damage can cause eye damage. The sun may burn the cornea and eventually may lead to cataracts. The most efficient way to protect your eyes is with sunglasses. Be sure to read the labels to see that the lenses provide 100% UV protection. The sun is all around us and we cannot escape it. Follow these simple guidelines and you should stay safe in the sun. Avoid the strongest sun hours of the day, wear light coverings and find shady areas, use sunscreen efficiently and wear sunglasses. The sun is our friend, but can be our enemy when we don't follow these simple rules!

Cord blood, once considered medical waste, is now seen as a valuable tool in fighting leukemia, immune diseases and inherited blood diseases like sickle cell anemia, because it is rich in stem cells. Stem cells are uniquely able to develop into a wide variety of other highly specialized types of cells. Demand for cord blood transplants is expected to increase "exponentially," says hematologist Dr. Graham Sher, CEO at Canadian Blood Services, which has proposed setting up and managing a national cord-blood bank. Sher estimates such a project would cost about $4.5 million to set up and over $2 million per year to maintain. It currently costs about $25,000 US on the global market to purchase a cord blood sample for a transplant. Email to a friend There are two public cord-blood banks in Canada, in Montreal and Edmonton, housing only a few thousand samples. Some new parents are also paying private banks to store their children's cord blood, as insurance in case the child or a sibling ever develops a blood disease. Last year, 45 people in Canada were treated with stem cells from cord blood -- almost all of it from donors outside Canada. There are about 150,000 cord-blood samples held in 50 public blood banks around the world. Â© The Leader-Post (Regina) 2007 Scandal Sheet: Brad Pitt Brad Pitt was spotted in Montreal...

The grant will be used in conjunction with an additional 20 million dollars supplied by the university and the government to creat the world's leading center of health program analysis and evaluation, a project that will be led by Dr. Christopher Murray, a widely known Harvard University economist. "In medicine, we would never think to sell a drug that had not been completely shown to be safe and effective," said Dr. Julio Frenk, a former health minister for Mexico who is now a senior adviser to the Gates Foundation. "Yet we often think nothing of launching some large-scale social or health intervention without first doing the same kind of rigorous study to accurately identify the problem and most likely solutions," Frenk added. The project will work by focusing on judging success or failure in global health practices and policies, whether by foundations, governments, corporations or private organization. "My foray into this area was motivated by frustration with a simple question: What are the biggest health problems in the world, and where are people with these problems living?" he asked. "The first thing I learned is that, in global health, everyone exaggerated the problem they were working on." "The history of development projects, not just in health, is littered with enormous investments that very often don't yield anything," he said. Murray states that it is very important that because of the great donations by organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, it is impairitive that their investments result in a positive outcome. "This represents a tremendous step forward for the university and for all of the global health community," said Dr. Pat Wahl, dean of the UW School of Public Health.

Researchers believe that some chronic insomniacs also exhibit signs of a surge in libido and "compulsive sexual behaviours". Dr Carlos Schenck, a senior psychiatrist at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Centre in Minneapolis, led a study into "sexsomnia". He states that in some cases sexsomnia behaviour can be upsetting or frightening for the sleeper's partner. But, he added, many sufferers delay seeking help because they fear that doctors will not believe their behaviour is really unconscious. He said: "More reports are surfacing of abnormal sexual behaviours emerging during sleep. "While people may think this type of behaviour is humorous, in reality it can be a serious problem for some individuals and couples."

Festivities will kick off on Friday, June 8 with one of the main events of the evening being the luminaria ceremony, where cancer victims and survivors will be honored in a variety of special ways. &#8220;The luminaria ceremony will begin a little after dark and one of the ways we will be recognizing victims and survivors that night is by placing a luminaria bag along the track with their name on it,&#8221; said luminaria chairperson Janet Moore. &#8220;When the lights all go off, they create a soft glow around the track which really changes the atmosphere in the stadium. The luminaria bags are a really great way to honor friends and loved ones and they&#8217;re only $5 each.&#8221; Luminarias are not the only way that cancer victims and survivors will be recognized at this year&#8217;s Relay For Life. Moore said interested parties may also purchase a memorial &#8220;star&#8221; and, if they choose, have their loved one&#8217;s name and photo included in a special slide show presentation. &#8220;I want people to realize there are all kinds of ways to honor and remember those who have touched their lives in some way. As in years past, they can purchase a large star cut-out for $15 which will bear the name of the person they wish and it will be placed on the fence around the track near the stage area,&#8221; Moore explained. &#8220;In addition to the luminarias and the stars, we will also have a large screen set up near the stage this year where we will be showing slides of cancer victims and survivors. If you purchase a luminaria bag and a star, we will also add a slide for only $1 more,&#8221; she said. &#8220;If you would like to have a picture of someone &#8216;in memory of&#8217; or &#8216;in honor of&#8217; included in the slide show presentation, all you have to do is bring a scannable photo and their information by the Sonic office before the Relay so we will have plenty of time to include them.&#8221; Along with the traditional luminarias, stars and slides, Moore said she has added something new this year in which cancer victims and survivors may be shown special honor in a Polynesian fashion. &#8220;We&#8217;re trying something a little different this year where we will be selling tiki torches as a way to honor people at the Relay. They are $35 each and we&#8217;ll set them up around the track along with the luminaria bags,&#8221; Moore said. &#8220;There will be a sign on each one with the information about the honored individual and people can decorate them any way they want to. Then they can take them home after the Relay and next year they can use them again for a donation of only $25.&#8221; Moore noted all proceeds raised during this year&#8217;s Relay For Life will be donated to the American Cancer Society, which has dedicated itself to diminishing the suffering caused from cancer and eliminating cancer altogether through research, education, advocacy and service. For more information on this week&#8217;s Garvin County Relay For Life or to purchase a luminaria, star, slide or tiki torch, call Janet Moore at 405-238-7594 or go by the Sonic office located at 517 S.

Jun. 4 2007 12:13 PM ET Children may love "heelys" -- those trendy sneakers with the wheels inside that let kids zip around -- but doctors warn the shoes are leading to a host of injuries that are sending kids to the emergency room. Roller shoes are a popular type of sneaker with a convertible or removable wheel in the heel. The innovative shoes allow "heelers" to go from a walk to a roll by simply shifting their body weight. The most popular brand, Heelys, was first launched in 2000 in the United States, and are now sold in 70 countries. Street Gliders are a similar version in which wheels are strapped to regular running shoes. The devices also allow users to combine walking with rolling by simply shifting body weight. According to a study published in the journal , the orthopedic department of one hospital in Dublin, Ireland, saw 67 children admitted over 10 weeks last summer for injuries suffered while using "roller shoes." Interestingly, most of those injured -- 56 of them -- were girls. The most common location of injuries were in the arms, wrists and shoulders and included fractures and dislocations. None of the injured children had been using protective gear when injured. More than half of the injuries occurred the first time the child used his or her roller shoes or while learning to use them. The children were aged anywhere from 6.2 to 14.9 years, with a mean age of 9.6 years. Despite their injuries, 54 per cent of the children said they would continue "heeling" or "street gliding" after they recovered. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission says several injuries have been reported in the United States as well, including at least one death related to the shoes. The Canadian Safety Council issued a consumer alert in January 2006 advising children and parents of children using Heelys to wear protective gear and to avoid heeling on roads, sidewalks, and wet surfaces. They recommended a ban on heeling in public buildings and malls, as well as school hallways and playgrounds. The safety council estimates that a month with daily practice is required to master the "heeling" technique, to learn to control and balance of the body's centre of gravity. The study authors recommend close supervision during the learning curve and use of protective gear at all times. "Wrist guards should always be worn to reduce impact forces and distribution when a child falls on the outstretched hand, because upper-limb trauma constitutes 86.5% of our cases," the authors note. Last April, Heelys said a study it commissioned shows that their shoes have a safer injury rate than skateboarding, inline skating and even swimming. The company notes that the shoes are sold with safety information including a recommendation to wear protective gear.

As little as 20 minutes of casual sun exposure each day adds up to more than 120 hours of UV radiation annually. That equals five days of serious sunbathing. Whether exposed for five minutes or five hours, incidental amounts of sun exposure can contribute to lines and wrinkles, alterations in the skin's natural defense system, discoloration and uneven tone. According to Clinique's guiding dermatologist, Dr David Orentriech, the sun accounts for approximately 90 percent of the aging appearance. Only 10 percent is due to actual number of years lived. If a person can minimize the daily dose of incidental sun exposure, she will reduce the single most important factor to the appearance of aging. To minimize daily sun damage, using a proper sunscreen product each morning as the last step in facial treatment prior to any makeup application is absolutely necessary. Sunscreen protects from ultraviolet rays that cause a wrinkled, leathery look and possibly skin cancer. But from years of clinical research and countless consultations with dermatologists, Clinique has found the number one skin mistake that most people make is not wearing sunscreen - or in wearing it incorrectly. Skincare manufacturers always proclaim the importance of wearing sunscreen. However, with so many sunblock creams on the market working in different ways, a little knowledge of the product and its correct usage is essential. Based on their mechanism of action, sunscreens can broadly be classified into two groups - chemical absorbers and physical blockers. Chemical absorbers work by absorbing ultraviolet radiation and can be further differentiated by the type of radiation they absorb, UVA or UVB, or both. Physical blockers work by reflecting or scattering UV radiation. SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor and is the system used worldwide to determine how much protection a sunscreen provides. A sunscreen with SPF of 15 provides 93.6 percent protection against UVB. Protection against UVB is increased to 94.3 percent with SPF of 25, according to Clinique global research. SPF 15 will protect you for 2 1/2 hours while SPF 30 will protect for five hours in theory. However, the effectiveness of a sunscreen has more to do with how much is applied, how often it is applied, whether the person is sweating heavily and being exposed to water. It is recommended to apply sunscreen every two hours. When choosing a bottle, make sure you look for the words broad spectrum, as SPF only refers to UVB rays. Skin needs to be protected from UVA rays (the cause of premature aging and skin cancer) too. A proper broad-spectrum sunscreen should contain avobenzone, titanium dioxide or zinc oxide for significant UVA protection. Clinique City Block Sheer SPF 25 (250 yuan (US$32.68)/40 milliliters) The skincare giant's new City Block Sheer SPF 25, a lightweight, subtly tinted, oil-free addition to the City Block family, is even easier to layer and more sheer on skin than before. New to the formula are moisture-wicking fibers and a specific extract sourced from algae that helps reduce excess oil on the skin's surface. It also helps in repelling perspiration and in making makeup stay put. This 100 percent physical (non-chemical) formula provides powerful antioxidants and anti-irritants that Clinique's City Block line is known for. Cleansing with a makeup remover is strongly suggested. Elizabeth Arden Ceramide Plump Perfect Moisture Cream SPF 30 (710 yuan/48 grams) This all-in-one state-of-the-art treatment and moisturizer surrounds skin with everything needed for a plumper and relaxed look with less lines. Most importantly, SPF 30 helps protect from the aging effects of the sun. It should be smoothed onto a cleansed face and neck daily before sun exposure. Guerlain Brightening High Protection SPF 50 PA+++ (500 yuan/30 ml) This highly-effective fluid provides skin with maximum UVA and UVB protection in addition to the other active ingredients in the range. Its perspiration-resistant texture protects the face from external aggressions. Apply gently in the morning with fingers. La Mer The SPF 18 Fluid (750 yuan/50 ml) Just as plants need sunlight to thrive, there are energies within the light spectrum necessary for well-being. Utilizing this principle, The SPF 18 Fluid captures beneficial light while diverting potentially damaging light. The product provides a trio of natural and sea-derived ingredients that uniquely benefit skin. Gemstones absorb light energy, transforming it into beneficial green light to enhance antioxidant activity. Photonic spheres within redirect and diffuse light. Smart, light-reactive seaweeds impart natural humectant properties and bind moisture to prevent dehydration. Worn over Creme de la Mer, the fluid acts as a generator, actually boosting its efficacy. Sisley Sunleya (1,600 yuan/50 ml) Sunleya contains a specific UVA/UVB filtering complex capable of blocking out 90 percent of sunrays; it only allows the right amount of rays to help the skin deploy its own natural photo-protection reflexes. Instead of artificially blocking the arrival of melanin and the thickening of the stratum corneum - what a "total sunblock" would do - Sunleya allows both processes to gradually deploy on the skin's surface in order to fulfill their essential defense function. Fancl SunGuard 30 (for face and body) (228 yuan/60 ml) This product is preservative-free and gentle to skin. It contains no UV absorbents, but provides a high level of long-lasting protection against harmful UV rays. It smoothens on skin easily without leaving white residues, while providing a moisturizing effect. It is also resistant to water, perspiration and sebum. It is highly recommended for sport and leisure time. It can also be used as a makeup base. Estee Lauder Cyber White UV Defense SPF 30/PA++ (425 yuan/50 ml) This protective base safeguards skin out of UVA/UVB and environmental pollution. The antioxidation gene will fight against the violation of freeradicals. Along with the "Resvertrol" that may enhance the effect of whitening and moisturizing, the base feels light on the face and makes skin brighter.a M.A.C Prep + Prime Face Protect SPF 50/PA++ (360 yuan/30 ml) Apply this skin-protecting cream with SPF 50 under makeup to prime the skin for the sun. It is featherweight, fast-absorbing, oil-free, and invisible; it will not affect the look, texture or long wear integrity of the makeup. Specially formulated with oil-absorbing powder, it helps prevent oil breakthrough and provides a high-level, broad spectrum sun protection. Bobbi Brown SPF 50/PA++ Protective Face Base (550 yuan/50 ml) This face base is a lightweight, invisible UV protector with SPF 50/PA++ that works beautifully under all types of Bobbi Brown makeup without altering color. It contains sebum-absorbing powders that provide excellent oil-absorbing benefits and sucrose and caffeine that calms skin as the formula protects against environmental aggressors. This breathable cream is non-greasy, easily-absorbed and blends smoothly into skin. Click the button to copy the title and the URL of this story.

Euros to HIV/Aids Global Fund Posted to the web 3 June 2007 European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso Thursday pledged 100 million euro about 134 million U.S. dollars for the HIV/AIDS global fund for 2007, and proposed a further 300 million euros about 403 million dollars over the following three years, Xinhua reported from Brussels. Barroso made the commitment at a meeting with top leaders of the Global Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. He said "the European Commission is one of the leaders in the global fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. This pledge keeps us there. It is part of the European Union&#39;s commitment to the poorest and most vulnerable, in terms of aid, trade and political support." The European Commission has provided 522 million euro, about 702 million dollars, to the fund over the past five years. So far programmes supported by the global fund have saved approximately 1.8 million lives. Currently, an estimated 3,000 additional lives are being saved per day, through providing AIDS treatment for 1.1 million people, tuberculosis treatment for 2.8 million, as well as effective medicines for 23 million cases of malaria, and distributing bed nets to 30 million families in Africa and elsewhere. Meanwhile, President Bush has asked the US Congress to set aside 30 billion US dollars over five years for the global fight against HIV/AIDS, BBC reported. He said the sum would double the current US commitment and provide treatment for 2.5 million people. The funding would also be aimed at preventing over 12 million new infections. United Nations agencies said about 40 million people worldwide are infected with HIV/AIDS. Two-third of those live in sub-Saharan Africa and almost three-quarter of deaths from HIV/AIDS last year also occurred there. The number of peple has increased everywhere, with the most striking increases in East Asia and Central Asia/Eastern Europe, it was indicated. The World Health Organization (WHO) Wednesday urged affected countries to carry out HIV tests on everyone attending health centres unless they "opt out". &copy; 2007 Ethiopian Herald.

This year the event will centre around the theme , with WHO and associated stakeholders promoting this method as the ONLY effective measure to protect individuals - including women, children, and those sharing a public or workspace â" from exposure to and risk of second-hand smoke. There has been a recent upsurge of global awareness of the need for tobacco-free environments, with many countries passing legislation to ban smoking in all public areas. This comes as a drastic change from times past when smoking was a social norm. FIP wholeheartedly supports WHO and partner efforts in controlling the use of tobacco in public areas through adopting smoke-free environments in all FIP related meetings, Congresses, activities and at Headquarters. WHO reports that tobacco is the second major cause of death in the world, with the over 650 million global smokers eventually succumbing to the ills of tobacco use. Furthermore, and perhaps more devastating, hundreds of thousands of individuals die every year from disease related to exposure to second-hand smoke. FIP IN ACTION - At Home and Around the World In addition to promoting 100% tobacco-free environments throughout Federation activities, FIP has made great strides in raising awareness of the devastating risks of tobacco use, and how pharmacists around the world can play an integral part in curbing tobacco use and encouraging smoking cessation. Through the development of the Global Network of Pharmacists Against Tobacco ( ), which aims to increase communication and interaction between professionals working towards increasing the role of the pharmacist in anti-tobacco activities and the joint tobacco-free declarations with multi-disciplinary partners in the World Health Professions Alliance, FIP is making it a priority to involve pharmacists in every step in the shared vision for a smoke-free world. To showcase this philosophy, this year the 67th FIP World Congress of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences ( ) will host a half day Session on Curbing the Tobacco Pandemic - The Role of the Pharmacist . The Session will provide a global perspective, welcoming speakers from all areas who will bring to light the widespread threat of tobacco use and also how pharmacists may best play a role in harm reduction and patient support. A variety of worldwide examples will be showcased, with topics focusing on the threat of the global smoking pandemic and the role of pharmacists in its control, health impacts of tobacco use in China, enhancing pharmacists' skills, to name but a few. Through these ongoing initiatives, FIP is dedicated to fighting tobacco use on global level, and encourages all Members, pharmacists and pharmaceutical scientists to be actively involved in these endeavours. International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) FIP is a world-wide federation of national pharmaceutical (professional and scientific) associations, with a mission to represent and serve pharmacy and pharmaceutical sciences around the globe. Through its member associations, FIP connects, represents and serves more a million pharmacists and pharmaceu-tical scientists around the world. FIP was founded in The Hague, The Netherlands, in 1912 and still has its central office in The Hague. Although FIP is a federation of associations, any pharmacist or pharmaceutical scientist can apply to become an Individual Member of FIP. FIP is more than ninety years old. As an organisation, it has taken on new activities over the years and has grown in size. FIP works with its members in mind and is implementing positive changes to better serve its members. FIP activities are designed to improve the long-term effectiveness of patient care. It has actively worked towards the WHO goal of health for all, and intends to continue to do so.

But for the six million women and their partners in the U.S. who report difficulties conceiving, the stress and discomfort of approaching a doctor's office is no laughing matter. Now couples have another option on path towards parenthood. The first at-home fertility screening kit for men and women hits store shelves across the U.S. on Monday, allowing couples to assess their fertility in the privacy of their own homes. is screening technology developed by ., and has been available in the UK and Ireland. It is the only test of its kind, including fertility screening for both men and women in one package. The kit includes a male fertility test that measures the concentration of motile sperm, a key indicator of sperm health. The female fertility test measures a particular hormone that is a marker for the age of a woman's ovaries and their ability to produce eggs. Both tests produce results in less than 90 minutes. Eating Ice Cream May Improve Fertility in Some Women Trans Fats May Increase Infertility Study Links Poor Sperm Quality to Cell Phone Use Male Infertility May Have Obesity Link Sperm Quality Declines As Men Age The test is 95 percent accurate compared to standard lab tests, but even more important, it stresses that it takes two to make a baby. "Many women believe that the ability to conceive a baby is primarily up to them," Robert Thompson, president of Genosis said in a news release. "In fact, research shows that the issues affecting fertility are almost evenly split between the sexes. Because of this it is essential to involve and screen both partners."

Now Featuring MORE of Everything! New Depression Rx: Get Married , Special to LiveScience posted: 04 June 2007 09:34 am ET People who are looking to ease depression may have a new treatment option--marriage. A recent study suggests that marriage provides a greater psychological boost to depressed people than to happy people, even if the marriage is so-so. Previous studies have suggested that the psychological perks of marriage depend upon marriage quality--a gives rise to a happy couple, and vice versa. Other studies have shown that depressed people, who tend to communicate poorly and require more caring and support than happy people, also end up in unhappier marriages. So Adrianne Frech, a sociology graduate student at Ohio State University, and her colleague, Kristi Williams, speculated that happy people would garner more psychological perks from marriage than depressed people. To test their theory, they looked at a sample of 3,066 who had been interviewed and tested for depression once in either 1987 or 1988 and then again five years later. In the interviews, they were asked about the quality of their marriage (if they were married). On average, controlling for differences in depression, subjects who had gotten married over the five-year span between the two interviews reported improved psychological well-being in the second interview--scoring an average of 3.42 points lower on the 84-point depression scale--than their counterparts who did not marry. When they teased apart how marriage affected those who had been depressed at the start of the study to those who had been happy, however, they came across something unexpected. The depressed who married scored an average of 7.56 points lower on the depression scale than the depressed who did not marry, while those who were and got married scored only 1.87 points lower on the scale. In other words, marriage provided a much bigger psychological boost to the depressed subjects than to the happy subjects. &ldquo;We were surprised,&rdquo; Frech told . &ldquo;We expected the to have worse marital quality and therefore benefit less from a transition into marriage.&rdquo; The findings, to be published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior , hold true even though depressed people do have unhappier marriages. &ldquo;The depressed benefit more from a transition into marriage despite their having, on average, worse marital quality,&rdquo; Frech noted. The big remaining question, she says, is why depressed people benefit more from marriage than happy people. It could be that marriage provides the companionship and emotional support needed to help alleviate depression, she said.

Thanks. &laquo; Polish Man in Coma Since Communism, Wakes Up to Democracy Some Toothpaste from China Found to Contain Toxic Chemical Posted on: June 2, 2007 5:32 PM, by As if China's careless approach to the manufacturing of wheat gluten weren't bad enough, now there are reports of diethylene glycol in some toothpaste from the country. Diethylene glycol is similar in structure and chemistry to ethylene glycol (antifreeze). Like antifreeze, it has a sweet taste, hence the intentional addition of it to toothpaste The government warned consumers on Friday to avoid using toothpaste made in China because it may contain a poisonous chemical used in antifreeze. Out of caution, the Food and Drug Administration said, people should throw away toothpaste with labeling that says it was made in China. The FDA is concerned that these products may contain diethylene glycol. ... The alert says the agency found DEG in three products manufactured by Goldcredit International Trading in China. The products are Cooldent Fluoride, Cooldent Spearmint and Cooldent ICE. Analysis of the products revealed they contained between 3 percent and 4 percent DEG. The agency also found the chemical in one product manufactured by Suzhou City Jinmao Daily Chemical Co. in China. Analysis of that product, Shir Fresh Mint Fluoride Paste, found it contained about 1 percent DEG. China's food safety problems have in recent months become a matter of international concern, a situation reflected in trade talks between Chinese and U.S. officials in Washington last week. Most notably, on March 15, FDA learned that certain pet foods were sickening and killing cats and dogs. FDA found contaminants in vegetable proteins imported into the United States from China and used as ingredients in pet food. This is not the first time that diethylene glycol has shown up in health controversies. Some episodes have been tragic. From The most infamous incident was the 1937 Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster in the USA, in which 107 people died after taking sulfanilamide dissolved in diethylene glycol. This episode was the impetus for the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938. In recent years, deaths from medicines adulterated with diethylene glycol have been reported from South Africa, India, Nigeria, Argentina, Haiti, and Panama. In Haiti in 1996, 85 children died due to glycerine contaminated with diethylene glycol in a paracetamol syrup produced by Pharval Laboratories, a Haitian company, which did not use standard quality assurance procedures to verify the purity of the glycerine (which was supplied by a Dutch company, Vos, from a manufacturer in China, but the point of contamination with DEG was never determined). In 1985 a small number of producers of Austrian wine were found to be adulterating their product with diethylene glycol in order to give the wine a sweeter and more full-bodied taste. The amount added was not high enough to be immediately toxic (one would have to ingest about 28 bottles per day for two weeks); however, exports of Austrian wine collapsed. As a result of this incident, stricter regulations were imposed on Austrian wine makers, and the industry shifted its emphasis from the production of bulk, somewhat sweet wines to lower yields of higher quality, drier wines. Thus, the 'antifreeze scandal' is regarded as having been positive for the industry in the long-term. In 1990, in Bangladesh, 339 children developed kidney failure, and most of them died, after being given paracetamol (acetaminophen) syrup contaminated with diethylene glycol. In October 2006 the CDC and the Ministry of Health of Panama detected toxic levels of diethylene glycol in a sugarless liquid expectorant during an investigation of 46 deaths from a syndrome characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms, renal failure and paralysis. Almost all the victims were hypertension and diabetes patients in their 40s to 80s. Criminal investigations are ongoing. The source of the contamination was found to be the Taixing Glycerine Factory, a Chinese company in Hengxiang, China. Taixing Glycerine sold diethylene glycol falsely labeled as pharmaceutical grade glycerine, through the state-owned Chinese trading company CNSC Fortune Way, based in Beijing. A government agency in Panama purchased the falsely labeled product containing diethylene glycol and incorporated it into 260,000 bottles of cold medicine. The United States Food and Drug Administration issued an Industry Guidance Document highlighting appropriate testing procedures for use of glycerin in response to product contamination and misrepresentation. In May 2007, Panamanian officials reported that toothpaste manufactured in China with "glycerine" contained high levels of DEG. [wow- wikipedia is amazing, they have this up already!] Also in May 2007 the same toothpaste was found in some Costa Rican stores. Fast action by the Ministry of Health, and notification through the media, prevented poisonings due to this product. This event was linked to the death sentence of a former pharmaceuticals control officer in China, as the Costa Rican newspaper La NaciÃ³n reported on its issue of May 30th. The Costa Rican Ministry of Health will file charges against the local importing and distributing companies, and reviewing licensing and permits in the stores where the product was detected. Because of the natural sweetness of the substance, domesticated animals have often been victims of DEG poisoning after consuming spilled or leaking antifreeze from vehicles. I'm not sure if the amount of DEG in the toothpaste is enough to cause much toxicity, especially if not ingested but rather spit out normally. But still, China needs to step it up.

Posted by: Thom H | June 2, 2007 06:39 PM Good advice would be to avoid all food products that are made in China - I wouldn't use dog food made from Chinese exports, so it makes less sense to use human consumables. Pirating CDs, software, and DVDs is one thing, but putting poisons in consumables should knock the money grabbers out of the world's food market.

And, why we import them. If you want higher quality products...be ready to pay higher prices. That said, it is still very irresponsible for Chinese government to not have higher export quality inspections. Perhaps, they just want to continue to grow, but this "backlash" may help Chinese government and companies become more responsible. Otherwise, the export of Chinese products into US would be reduced.

My parents are still using a 25 year old Whirlpool fridge and have NEVER HAD any issues! Wish they made some in the US again :( WE ARE AT FAULT for buying it cause they have CHEAP pricetag! If you think about it though, it's MORE EXPENSIVE in the long run... I rather pay 25% more for something that lasts 3-5 years, rather than some CRAP chinese product that lasts less than 1 year! The American corporations are just using China to make North America the BIGGEST JUNKYARD in the world. To give us MORE CRAP for garage sales, while quality suffers. Whenever I've bought anything from Europe, or EVEN ASIA (like Japan), they have lasted a lot more than the same thing sold here cheaper made in china. In stuff like electronics and appliances, ppl dont care to notice much, but hopefully these food scares will WAKE US UP. I for one, WILL STOP and DO MY BEST, NOT TO BUY CHINESE CRAP!!! PLEASE PEOPLE, DO NOT SEEK MORE STUFF to pile up in ur home... Go after QUALITY, pay a little extra at the begining and actually SAVE MONEY at the end! June 3, 2007 07:46 PM our newspaper today carried a wire report about Chinese vitamins. The Chinese have capture 90% of the US market for vitamin having driven almost everyone else out of business. They make 70% of the world's penicillin, 50% of the asprin and 35% of acetaminophen (often sold as tylenol). Also the bulk of vitamins A, B12, C and E. The safety inspectors for the Weisheng Pharmaceutical Co (which is the largest maker of vitamin C in the world) work for the city government which is part owner of the Weisheng parent company. That is a conflict of interest. on Tuesday Zheng Xiaoyu, former chief of the food and drug administration, was given a death sentence by firing squad. He was charged with accepeting $832,000 in bribes to allow unsafe drugs on the market which killed and crippled people. I saw another article the other day listing other food products including canned mushrooms with filth in them. Posted by: Jim | June 3, 2007 07:49 PM Three years ago a Chinese friend of mine said Chinese factories offered three different quality/price points. Western corporate buyers always went for the lowest quality/lowest price one. Being paid $6 per day, Chinese workers can produce good quality goods for low prices, provided the input quality control is adequate. In many cases their quality control has improved massively in the last 10 years, as they've gained a generation of experienced engineers. These latest cases arent' quality issues, they're fraud, like a pharmaceutical manufacture case we had in Australia a few years ago, but without the efficient recall system. Posted by: davidp | June 3, 2007 08:10 PM Hey there, WalMart shoppers, you get what you pay for! That's why the Smiley logo just keeps on smiling: they are laughing all the way to the bank, and stupid customers are paying out their savings in medical bills because they decided to step over dollars to save a penny. Posted by: Harvey Oxenhorn | June 3, 2007 08:44 PM It is not fair just to say that Chinese products are crap. Of course they cannot produce high technology products as well as the West. They do not have a history of using or producing products of this nature. Also, you get what you pay for. If you want high end high technogy products go to the West and if you want natural products go to the East. Posted by: alan | June 3, 2007 08:56 PM I have to say it again... CHINESE MADE PRODUCTS ARE CRAP --> In General! However, we ARE THE BLAME for buying them at Walmart! It's not just east vs. west... for instance Japan is Asian and Japanese products are GREAT (look at their cars), also most things made in Taiwan are decent... whatever goes to be built in china is ONLY FOR its being CHEAP, and NOT for quality... therefore, ALL CHINESE MADE PRODUCTS ARE BY DEFINITION ... CRAP Posted by: Alex Bigelow | June 3, 2007 11:58 PM The country's top quality watchdog this weekend strongly disagreed with a warning by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over the safety of Chinese toothpaste, saying it was "unscientific, irresponsible and contradictory". In response to an FDA notice saying toothpaste made in China may contain a poisonous chemical, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said in a statement that it is safe to consume the chemical in question in small quantities. "Our research shows that toothpaste containing up to 15.6 percent diethylene glycol, the chemical that the US side is concerned about, is safe, even after prolonged use," the statement said. The US started checking Chinese toothpaste imports on May 23 as media reports that the products may contain diethylene glycol, a solvent sometimes used as a substitute for glycerin, a sweetener used in drugs. After finding Chinese toothpaste containing 3-4 percent diethylene glycol, the FDA on Friday issued a warning about toothpaste made in China. However, experts from the Chinese Health Ministry said that diethylene glycol is a "low-level" poison that does not accumulate in the body, and said there is no evidence that it can cause cancer or deformities. The AQSIQ also said that a list of the ingredients in the toothpaste exported to the US had been offered to the FDA. The list included diethylene glycol. Also, the toothpaste's labeling had already been registered with the FDA, meaning it could be sold in the US. "Therefore, the FDA warning is unscientific, irresponsible and contradictory," the AQSIQ said. "We've lodged a representation to the FDA and asked it to clarify the facts in a scientific manner as soon as possible." Joseph Famulare, an official with the FDA's center for drug evaluation and research, who was in Beijing attending a workshop this weekend, told China Daily that the US laws ban diethylene glycol as an ingredient in toothpaste. He said recent safety scandals highlighted the importance of being aware of all the ingredients and intermediates in products. To improve the quality of management and the regulatory framework for drug manufacturing, he said the FDA and Peking University had jointly launched a new graduate program on pharmaceutical engineering management. Posted by: aaa | June 4, 2007 08:45 AM Hey Alex blow? u ARE BY DEFINITION ... CRAP low quality too. lol Posted by: asdas | June 4, 2007 08:48 AM This sounds hokey but the only products I use say " made in America ". I buy beef and pork from area farmers and the same for produce. I do buy some things in the markets but I'm very careful and I read ALL labels. Posted by: barney8 | June 4, 2007 10:05 AM There is no question China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) is without a doubt much more trustworthy and scientifically superior to this United States Food and Drug Administration. China, known the world over as synonymous with highest quality, would never knowingly place any human being, regardless of nationality or party affiliation, at even the slightest perceived risk. The manner and regard that the United States FDA cautioned consumers is unacceptable, especially since Diethylene Glycol is only a poison of low toxicity, and a suitable proven prefered safe alternative may cost as much as several cents more. Posted by: Average Citizen | June 4, 2007 11:08 AM Curious how the Chinese government puts out statements defending the use of diethylene glycol in products such as toothpaste, and attacks the FDA's warning, while totally missing the point that Chinese manufacturers are *mis-labeling* DEG as glycerin! It's intentional fraud, to make more money, in a product people ingest, yet the Chinese want to quibble over the level of harm DEG may or may not present. How about banning their products until we're assured their labeling is honest? Posted by: Robert | June 4, 2007 11:31 AM I look at labels first and check out where it's made. I try very very hard not to buy Chinese crap. Chinese products are ok for Chinese in China. In North America we are used to things that lasts a long time. Now we are finding out that China is exporting food. I'll eat bread and drink water before I ingest Chinese crap. If we all together wise up and don't buy Chinese made crap maybe we get some of the jobs back in North America. I can see this happen. Our governments should have stricter regulations for imports. Posted by: charles vella | June 4, 2007 12:53 PM See this article from the NY times -- Fever medicine made in China also uses the poison diethylene glycol to save money and may be responsible for thousands or tens of thousands of deaths in mostly poor countries: June 4, 2007 01:10 PM I just wonder; before this happened, how many of you knew where your pet food or toothpaste was manufactured? Oh, and just in case we get too high and mighty about it, the peanut butter that gave everybody salmanilla poisoning was manufactured right here in Georgia. June 4, 2007 01:19 PM "Oh, and just in case we get too high and mighty about it, the peanut butter that gave everybody salmanilla poisoning was manufactured right here in Georgia." Yes, and both the FDA's and manufactures immediate and prolonged denial, no warning to dispose of the product, and failure to recall it contributed to problem. Had it been China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ), that would most assuredly never have happened. Posted by: Party Member | June 4, 2007 01:45 PM A couple years ago when SARS was a big issue I was riding in the elevator with a woman carrying a box of Chinese take-out food. A third woman said she loved Chinese food, but was afraid of SARS. And this was before bird flu or Andrew Speaker. June 4, 2007 02:11 PM "experts from the Chinese Health Ministry said ..." Paraphrasing: "We see nothing, we hear nothing, we say nothing, what is this thing you call 'the google'?; do NOT click on the next line, by order of the Chinese Health Ministry."

The funding, matched with 20 million dollars from the public university in the northwest state, will create a new Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation to conduct "independent, rigorous evaluations of health programs worldwide." The goal is to help guide international policymaking by analyzing health needs and outcomes, and assessing the performance of health programs, the university said. "Health policy must be based on evidence, not speculation," said Tachi Yamada, president of the Gates Foundation's Global Health Program. "There has been a huge increase in resources for global health in recent years, and it's essential to evaluate the impact of these investments. With high-quality data, we can ensure resources go where they are needed most, and dramatically improve health care delivery." UW President Mark Emmert said the Gates grant, the largest private gift in the school's history, "will enable us to bring unparalleled talent and resources to bear on the world's greatest health challenges." The new institute will be directed by Christopher Murray, who was previously director of the Harvard University Initiative for Global Health, and is a former senior official at the World Health Organization (WHO). The institute will focus on three main areas: health monitoring, including the prevalence of major diseases and the availability of health services; evaluation of the effectiveness of existing health programs; and dissemination of health data and information to decision-makers, researchers, and the public. "We hope to set the gold standard for scientifically rigorous evaluation in health," said Murray. "Global health spending is on the rise, yet too often there are gaps in information about where these funds can have the greatest impact." Murray said the institute will play a key role in helping achieve global health targets such as the Millennium Development Goals, which call for major improvements in health by 2015.

Your Health & Personal Freedom at Stake This post was written by Samantha Quinnsbury on 4 June, 2007 (10:42) | Are you one of millions of Americans who take a multi-vitamin every day?Â  Do you enjoy a V8 with your afternoon lunch?Â  How about take a fish-oil supplement to keep your arteries in good working order? Believe it or not, you may not be able to do these things for you health in the future if proposed legislation is passed. , which seeks to have all vitamins, supplements, natural remedies, garden herbs, even water in some cases, regulated by the Food and Drug Administration, would take all of the natural options you have regarding your health and put it all in the hands of the government. Chemical based, synthesized and lab-produced medicines will still be available to you over the counter. But naturally grown ginseng, gingko biloba, ginger root, and all other natural medicines will have to be purchased through your doctor.Â  Think this doesnât apply to you?Â  Donât know what is likely to follow?Â  Developments that could take place after this legislation is passed may make growing common garden herbs an arrestable offense, raw sprouts and other anti-cancer foods may be regulated as drugs, even bottled waters and teas, which could âtreatâ dehydration, could become a thing of the past. Suddenly herbal remedies and food flavorings, used for hundreds, maybe thousands of years by humans to season food and treat common ailments, will be regarded as illegal and may bring you jail time. Not ridiculous enough for you?Â  What about the fact that such innocuous items as dumbbells and weight machines, mainstays of fitness for decades, will need to pass individual inspection and receive a stamp of approval? Or perhaps FDA regulation of massage oils and handheld massagers? Even the heated stones massage therapists use to help relieve muscular tension will be regulated under this legislation. Yes, this means they will actually look at a pile of rocks and determine whether or not they are medical devices. If its medical devices they want, I have a whole pile of them in my backyard.Â  Certainly the FDA has more important issues to be addressing than rosemary and thyme.Â  Perhaps the scandal isnât keeping it busy enough?Â  As of March 31, Merck knew of 27,250 lawsuits alleging 45,700 incidences of personal injury or loss due to Vioxx. How about the new scandal regarding and its 43% increase in heart attacks and possible 64% increase in cardiovascular death?Â  The FDA has a problem with herbal remedies, from which very, very, very few people have ever died, and yet approves chemical and synthetic drugs that categorically resulted in the deaths of thousands? The disconnect here is vast. and let them know that Big Government is big enough, and certainly the FDA has more important issues with which to wrangle. may also be viewed at Let Others Know About This Post These icons link to social bookmarking sites where readers can share and discover new web pages.

JOHNSON TRENTON, N.J. -- Too much of a good thing can be painful, even deadly, when it comes to sunshine. So with summer just about in full swing, dermatologists and skin cancer researchers say people should limit their time in the sun and take other steps to protect themselves from the sun. "Enjoy it, but enjoy it in moderation and with common sense," said Dr. Warren Heymann, head of the division of dermatology at Cooper University Hospital in Camden. With skin cancer on the rise, doctors have been issuing such warnings for years, but many people don't heed them - or wrongly think slapping on a little sunscreen once before a full day at the beach or pool is all they need. That's the biggest mistake people make, Heymann said. "It's not enough. If you're going to be outside, try to stay out of the midday sun, stay in the shade, wear appropriate clothing," use sunscreen and reapply it every two to three hours and after swimming or heavy sweating, Heymann said. Appropriate clothing includes a hat that covers the scalp, long sleeves if it's not too hot and fabrics that aren't open-weaved or too thin. A thin, white T-shirt allows the ultraviolet rays that cause skin cancer and sunburn to penetrate, so sunscreen should be applied underneath, said Dr. Jonathan Lee, a melanoma specialist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey in New Brunswick, part of the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. People should also check sunscreen labels to see exactly what the product does; the SPF, or sun protection factor, listed on the bottle only refers to protection against ultraviolet B rays, which primarily cause sunburn. UVA rays penetrate the skin more deeply and are the main cause of skin cancer and premature aging, so sunscreens that provide broad UVA and UVB protection are best. Older sunscreens block UVB rays well, but are less effective against UVA. Newer products do a better job against UVA rays but are much more expensive, Heymann said. Products with the ingredients Helioplex or Mexoryl are "photo stable," so they aren't broken down quickly by UVA rays and work for a few hours. Chemical-free blockers containing titanium oxide or zinc oxide, which also protect well against both UVA and UVB rays, are a particularly good choice for anyone experiencing rashes from other sunscreens, Heymann added. Lee said New Jersey has a high incidence of melanoma, which causes about 3 percent of skin cancer cases but roughly 80 percent of skin cancer deaths nationally. He's not sure why it's so common here, but noted that about 90 percent of skin cancer cases are directly related to sun exposure, with the rest related to genes. "Some people are a lot more prone to developing skin cancer," Lee said. Those include fair-skinned people who burn rather than tan, people who have previously had melanoma or have a family history of it, and people with "atypical" moles: ones that are asymmetrical, have jagged borders or varying colors, and are about one-quarter inch in diameter or larger. Those moles and any showing signs of changes should be checked, because skin cancer usually is curable if treated early. This year, the American Cancer Society estimates about 59,000 Americans will be diagnosed with melanoma, and about 8,110 will die of it. That's up from about 48,250 new melanoma cases in 2002, when deaths were slightly higher at about 9,900, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In New Jersey, new melanoma cases rose by about 50 percent from 1999 through 2002, then dipped slightly in 2003, the latest year for which data are available. Including less dangerous skin cancers such as basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma, there are more than 1 million new U.S. cases a year, almost as many as all other cancers combined, said Alan Conney, director of the Laboratory for Cancer Research at Rutgers University. Reasons for the increase in cases include the thinning of the ozone layer, use of tanning salons and people going outside more - and wearing less clothing compared to decades ago when attire covered more skin, said Conney. He's been doing tests in mice on two substances that appear to prevent cells whose DNA has been damaged by ultraviolet light from turning cancerous. He's about to start testing them in people to try to develop a protective cream or oral medicine, but that could be years away.

Go to the Article E-mail to a friend Q&A: What to Know About Cord Blood Donation Pregnant women can donate their umbilical cord blood after their babies births so that cancer patients in need of stem cell transplants have another option in addition to bone marrow donation. M. D. Andersons Cord Blood Bank is one of many institutions worldwide that collect and store umbilical cord blood units from consenting mothers after the births of their infants. Answering questions about the cord donation process is Elizabeth Shpall, M.D., director of the M. D. Anderson Cord Blood Bank and a professor in M. D. Andersons Department of Stem Cell Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. Why are stem cells collected for cancer patients? Stem cells from bone marrow and umbilical cord blood are transplanted to regenerate blood cells destroyed by radiation therapy or cancer-killing drugs. What is the challenge of bone marrow transplants? Finding an exact donor match for a bone marrow transplant can take several months, and sometimes a perfect match is never found. One reason cord blood transplants are becoming an attractive alternative to bone marrow transplants is that stem cells from cord blood are frozen and ready to be shipped once identified, so they can be obtained very quickly in situations where patients have rapidly progressive diseases. Additionally, less matching is needed for cord blood than for marrow, so often this provides more options for patients who are difficult to match. Why do some women store and others donate cord blood? Pregnant women may opt to pay companies to store their cord blood so that their child will have a collection of stem cells that is an exact match in the event that he or she becomes seriously ill with a disease such as cancer and needs a stem cell transplant. In that situation, it is possible that the cord blood would carry the same disease and not be a good stem cell transplant for that patient. There also is a possibility that the childs stem cells might be a match for a sibling in need of a transplant. If a pregnant woman chooses to donate her cord blood to a cord blood center, it allows doctors to use those stem cells for potentially life-saving transplants in patients with cancer and other diseases of the bone marrow or immune system. How is cord blood collected? Immediately after the baby is delivered: The child is separated from the umbilical cord The umbilical cord is clamped, and blood is collected The blood is delivered to the cord blood bank Neither the mother nor baby feels anything. What happens to the cord blood after it is collected? When the cord blood is received at the bank, it is: Tested for infectious diseases and other problems Recorded in a database Made available to patients around the world Is it safe to donate cord blood? Since cord blood is collected after the babys birth, there is no risk. It does not interfere with the birth process. How can a mother donate her umbilical cord? First, she should find out if there is a blood bank or collection site in her area by asking her obstetrician, or by calling or visiting the National Marrow Donor Program website. The mother will be required to sign a consent form before she has her baby. Where does M. D. Anderson collect cord blood? M. D. Anderson receives cord blood donations from: Ben Taub General Hospital The Womans Hospital of Texas Collectors assist women with the donation process 24 hours a day at these Houston hospitals. M . D. Anderson is working with other local hospitals to initiate collection sites. What is M. D. Andersons donation process? When a woman is at least 34 weeks pregnant, she can call the Cord Blood Bank at (713) 563-8000 to express her desire to donate. When she goes to the hospital to deliver the baby, she should ask to see a cord blood collector to complete the paperwork required for cord donation. She also should tell her doctor or a nurse that she plans to donate her cord blood. How many cord blood banks are there? 52 in the world 25 in the United States Last year, the National Marrow Donor Program began a partnership with the International NetCord Foundation, a worldwide network of cord blood banks. The groups combined registry will be the worlds largest. Many banks are tied to academic medical centers. Why arent there more cord blood collection sites? Many issues must be considered in beginning a site, such as: Protection of donor confidentiality and rights Effectiveness of collection processes Employment and training of collectors As the process to donate and utilize cord blood evolves, more donation sites will be formed. Who is eligible to donate cord blood? Have no pregnancy-related risk factors Be at least 34 weeks pregnant The mother must not have: A history of cancer Be a healthy single birth Not have a parent or sibling with a cancer history There may be other requirements. The cord blood bank will discuss these with the mother. Is all the cord blood used for transplants? Sometimes the cord blood sample does not meet the target for quantity of stem cells. Other conditions may make it clinically unsuitable for transplantation. What happens to cord blood that is not used? Unused cord blood is Used to improve cord blood banking procedures How is cord blood matched to a possible recipient? The National Marrow Donor Program, the International NetCord Foundation and some cord blood banks (including M. D. Andersons Cord Blood Bank) maintain registries. Does it cost to donate cord blood? There is no cost to donate cord blood.

Storm survivors are dying from the effects of both psychological and physical stress, from the dust and mold still in dwellings to financial problems to fear of crime, health experts and officials say.

Get a New Job Save & Share Article "There is no doubt in my mind that Katrina is still killing our residents," Orleans Parish coroner Dr. Frank Minyard said this week. "People with pre-existing conditions that are made worse by the stress of living here after the storm. Old people who are just giving up. People who are killing themselves because they feel they can't go on," Minyard said. Some say an in-depth federal analysis is needed, despite a new state report that found no significant increase in deaths in the New Orleans area from January 2006 through June 2006. The state Department of Health and Hospitals is still compiling figures for the last six months of 2006. Dr. Raoult Ratard, the state epidemiologist, said "the only slight increase" in deaths was in the first three months of 2006 in Orleans Parish. But New Orleans medical officials say that jump, from 11.3 per 1,000 deaths to 14.3 per 1,000, _ a leap of more than 25 percent _ was anything but slight. Moreover, the report doesn't take into account evacuees who died while away from the city and were returned for burial. "Our death rate was already high, that's huge," said Dr. Kevin Stephens Sr., director of the New Orleans Health Department. Some New Orleans doctors questioned the accuracy of the population figures used to determine the death rate, saying they might have been too high. DHH secretary Dr. Fred Cerise said he was comfortable with the population data, which he said came from the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The city was abandoned after Katrina struck Aug. 29, 2005, and many people did not begin returning until mid-2006. The official death tolls in New Orleans stands at about 1,100. State health officials said deaths have not been listed as Katrina-related since the end of 2005, except for bodies found under storm wreckage. But Minyard said he believes the hurricane is still behind many deaths. Dr. Ronald Kessler, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School and head of a group that has monitored 3,000 exiled Katrina survivors, said reconstructing an individual's mental and physical state before death might help in determining exact causes of death.

The "Smoke-Free Walk" was aimed at urging the Japanese government to conform to international health standards by banning smoking in restaurants, workplaces, parks, train stations, and all other public places. Participants, who marched through the Ginza central street in the afternoon, also called on the Japanese authority to launch a wide-ranging national tobacco control regime that encompasses strict tobacco control laws, comprehensive tobacco education beginning at the elementary school level, public awareness campaigns for all age groups, and gender-specific campaigns to address the dramatic increase in the number of female smokers in recent years. Organizers said Japan is the only developed country lacked behind in the global anti-smoking campaign. The Japanese government was also called on to establish an independent Tobacco Control Agency that is authorized to coordinate all of the government's tobacco control efforts, and to increase the price of cigarettes from the current 2.48 to 2.64 U.S. dollars per pack to at least seven dollars per pack. On Thursday, a group of anti-tobacco activists gathered at the Japanese health ministry to present a list of policy demands, calling on the government to consider the exacerbation to the budget deficit brought about by tobacco use as the bad habit increases the burden of the health care system.

What is currently the leading cause of early death in Canada? New under the sun: Protective 'cocktail' screens that go on every which way Provided by: Canadian Press Written by: SAMANTHA CRITCHELL NEW YORK (AP) - So you don't like the feel of scratchy sand stuck in your sun lotion? Maybe you have an aversion to chemical ingredients, oils or the scent of faux coconut. Sorry, not valid excuses for skipping sunscreen any more. This year there are a dozen sunscreen applications to choose from - sprays, dry oils, powders and even wipes - and many with new, more effective ingredient "cocktails" that promise to protect better than ever. And most of them work when used properly, says Dr. Amy Wechsler, a Manhattan dermatologist who serves as a member of The American Academy of Dermatology and The Skin Cancer Foundation. Many of the newer ingredients target UVA rays. UVA rays are farther away and weaker than UVB rays (those are the kind that make you feel hot), but can dig deeper into the skin and ultimately can affect the dermis, Wechsler says. "A lot of the American companies are trying to max out what's available here and I think they've done a pretty good job," she says. Consumers, though, might find shopping for a broad-spectrum sunscreen confusing because they've been trained to make choices based on sun protection factor or SPF ratings, which only measure protection against UVB rays. "SPF is a small measurement of UV. There is so much else going on," says researcher Debbie D'Aquino, Clinique's vice-president of global product development. There are some key ingredients to look for: -Titanium dioxide and zinc oxide: Both natural ingredients that are physical blocks against the rays. They sit on top of the skin and keep the light from penetrating it. -Parsol 1789, aka avobenzone: One of the most common - and effective - chemical absorbers of UV light. Unlike blocks, absorbers need 30 minutes before they'll fully work. -Chemical absorbers octocrylene and benzophenone: D'Aquino warns the latter has a reputation for being irritating to sensitive skin. -Mexoryl SX: The first new sunscreen filter approved by the FDA in 18 years. It's considered "photostable," which means that after exposure to the sun, it maintains its protective ability longer and doesn't degrade as quickly as other UV filters. -Helioplex: Used in Neutrogena's Ultra Sheer Dry Touch Sunscreen, this ingredient combines avobenzone with oxybenzone for a more stable combination that doesn't lose blocking powers after continued exposure to sunlight. Dr. Warwick Morison, a professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins University, says the key words to look for on the label are "broad-band," "broad-spectrum" or "UVA/UVB protection." And make sure it says water-resistant, too. "It's pointless, in my opinion, to buy a sunscreen that doesn't stay on your skin," he says. And the minimum SPF for all skin types in all climates of the U.S. is 15, he advises. "Fifteen is for a person who has fair skin, tends to burn, tans with difficulty. But you can have a person who tans very easily, doesn't burn, but she'll complain about freckles on her chest. The damage is just showing up in a different way," says Morison, chairman of the photobiology committee of The Skin Cancer Foundation. For many people, how the sunscreen goes on is just as important as what is in it. Over the past few years, the industry has not only expanded its list of active ingredients but also the forms sunscreens take. The success of Coppertone's Continuous Spray, launched in 2005, seems to have produced a steady stream of non-lotion applications in an effort to court consumers turned off by the traditional white lotion that for some was too sticky or greasy. No matter which form you choose, Wechsler reminds users to use a thick coat. She recommends 85 ml (three ounces) of sunscreen, reapplying every two hours. Beth Janes, Self magazine's senior beauty features editor, picks aerosol sprays and "dry" lotions as newer forms of sunscreen that solve common complaints about texture. She says: -Aerosols make it easier to cover hard-to-reach spots, such as the back. Men particularly like that they don't have to rub the sunscreen into their body hair. -Dry-touch sunscreens with a high content of silica are technically lotions but they're absorbed so quickly into the skin there's never a feeling of wetness. "It feels really great and is good for oily skin." -Gels also are good for oily skin because they tend to have a higher alcohol content. For kids, though, Wechsler likes the continuous sprays. "I like that you can twist and get close. A child is a moving target. This gives more product per spritz," she says. Don't spray the face, though, because just about all sunscreens burn the eyes. Spray in your hands and then rub it on the face - a waterproof or water-resistant formula will help keep sunscreen from dripping into your eyes when you go swimming or start to sweat. There also are new sunscreens targeting people who have made botanical-based beauty products part of their routine. Burt's Bees, for one, is touting a new chemical-free sunscreen that uses a combination of titanium dioxide and hempseed oil. The company says it uses nanotechnology to get the formula to such a fine size so that it has a translucent appearance instead of the thick opaque white cream that most people associate with titanium or zinc. Meanwhile, Clinique has added plankton extract liposomes to one of its sunscreens. Researcher D'Aquino says one of plankton's enzymes has the capacity to reverse damage to the plant after repeated sun exposure and it seems to do the same to the skin. "There are some plants and teas that are good sunscreens," agrees Wechsler, naming green tea, seaweed, plankton and algae as good candidates. But don't go rubbing some seaweed on your skin and declare yourself protected just yet. "You probably wouldn't be able to do this on the beach unless you brought a blender. You need what's inside the plants," she says. View more cancer news Tell us what you think!

Chairman Bill Gates will help create a health research institute left without funding when Oracle Corp. Chief Executive Larry Ellison withdrew support roughly one year ago. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation said Monday it will contribute $105 million to help fund the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which will "conduct independent, rigorous evaluations of health programs worldwide." The institute will be directed by Dr. Christopher Murray, the Gates Foundation said. Before withdrawing support in the summer of 2006, Ellison intended to give $115 million to Harvard University to fund a similar institute, also to be run by Dr. Murray. cited the resignation of Harvard president Lawrence Summers, with whom Ellison had negotiated the contribution, as the reason for Ellison's decision to withdraw support. The UW's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation will monitor the spread of diseases worldwide, evaluate the effectiveness of health programs and help make health information widely available, the Gates Foundation said in a release. The UW's institute will be funded primarily by the Gates Foundation grant, with an additional $20 million coming from the university. It will employ some 100 faculty and staff when it is fully operational. The Gates Foundation grant "is the largest private gift in UW's history," UW President Mark Emmert said in the release. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation was formed in 2000, with the merger of the William H. Gates Foundation and the Gates Learning Foundation. Gates is expected to depart from his full-time position with Microsoft in mid-2008 in order to focus more on his philanthropic work. John Letzing is a MarketWatch reporter based in San Francisco.

Two dozen experts who met on the issue over the weekend have agreed there are not enough umbilical cord donors to meet the growing demand for regenerative stem cells in Canada. &#34;There are simply not enough marrow or cord donors in Canada at this time,&#34; Dr. Stephen Couban of the Canadian Bone Marrow Transplant Group said after the two-day meeting. &#34;The registries, both here and around the world, simply don&#39;t reflect the ethnic diversity that we see in Canada today. Canada is in a unique position to tap into a diverse and multicultural population for umbilical cord blood capable of providing stem cells to cure diseases such as cancer, immune disorders, metabolic disorders and bone marrow failure disorders, Couban said. However, Canada is &#34;lagging behind&#34; many countries simply because it does not have a public cord bank, he added. There are fewer than a dozen private cord blood banks in Canada &ndash; in Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia &ndash; but the cost of depositing cord blood starts with an average initial fee of about $1,000, plus $120 or more a year to keep it viable in the deep-freeze of liquid nitrogen. Currently, only two public banks exist in Canada: the Alberta Cord Blood Bank, funded in part by its private affiliate, the Canadian Cord Blood Registry; and one operated by HEMA Quebec, the province&#39;s equivalent of Canadian Blood Services. Both are enrolled with international cord blood registries, allowing Canadians in need of stem cells to seek a match with donors from other countries and vice versa. The blood agency&#39;s CEO, Dr. Graham Sher, told a news conference Sunday a national cord bank would need 10,000 samples and about $2.5 million a year to operate. The weekend meeting was the last stage in a consultation process Canadian Blood Services undertook after deputy health ministers from the provinces and territories asked it to draw up a business plan for a national public bank. Sher plans to take the proposal to them late this month. &#34;We do anticipate it&#39;s going to take several years to grow a large enough inventory (of samples),&#34; he said. &#34;We want to get started.&#34; Approval would enable the agency to begin collecting targeted samples designed to fill the ethnically diverse tissue types that now exist in Canada. &#34;It&#39;s not really `open your doors and come one, come all,&#34;&#39; said Sher. &#34;That doesn&#39;t necessarily allow you to, in the most effective manner possible, recruit from those communities that best reflect the fabric of Canada today.&#34; Canadians who donate their child&#39;s cord blood to a public bank give up rights over its use; it will go to a recipient most in need and with the best tissue match, in much the same way that donors and recipients for bone marrow transplants are chosen. Cord blood stem cells can do now what bone marrow transplants have traditionally done &ndash; rebuild the blood and immune systems of a child, and increasingly of adults, whose bone marrow has been damaged or destroyed from treating cancers like leukemia or from immune system-related disorders. But because the seeds of leukemia, for instance, are likely present in the child&#39;s cord blood at birth, using their own stem cells drawn from private banks to produce new oxygen-carrying red cells, infection-fighting white cells and platelets could only set them up for recurrence of the disease down the road. Public banks are strictly for stem cell transplantation among unrelated people, therefore minimizing the risk of transplanting already bad cells. Healthy stem cells transplanted from other donors would recognize cancer cells as foreign and try to eradicate them.

The 100 million dollar gifts have been rolling out over the past few days, and the University of Washington is the most recent institution to receive the sizable donation. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is giving 105 million dollars so the university can open a new research center to monitor global health programs. The university will make health data freely available to policy-makers, researchers and the public. The university says it's the largest private donation in the school's history. This weekend, the founder of software giant Siebel Systems pledged to donate 100 million dollars to his alma mater, the University of Illinois. And just days before that the University of Chicago announced a 100 million dollar anonymous donation. Copyright © 2007, Sinclair Acquisition IV, Inc. | : Adobe Acrobat required to view this document

Top cancer researchers are gathered at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting in Chicago. USA TODAY's rounds up the latest findings: Alternative medicine: Ginseng may relieve patients' fatigue Lung cancer: Radiating the brain found to stop spread of tumors Shark cartilage flounders; flaxseed shows promise Liver cancer: Kidney drug buys time Breast cancer: Black women lag in survival Kidney drug is first to buy time for liver cancer patients By Liz Szabo, USA TODAY A newly approved kidney cancer drug has become the first chemotherapy to help patients with advanced liver tumors live longer &#8212; a finding expected to change the way patients are treated, researchers announced today. Liver tumors rarely spread to other organs. But by the time they are diagnosed, most have spread too far around the liver to be removed surgically, says William Li, president of the Angiogenesis Foundation, which funds research on tumor blood vessels. He was not involved in the new study. About 40% of liver cancers are diagnosed at an advanced stage, according to the American Society of Clinical Oncology. By that point, treatments &#8212; such as heating or freezing the tumor &#8212; aren't very effective, Li says. More than 19,000 people are diagnosed each year, and nearly 17,000 die. That's why doctors are excited about Nexavar, a pill first approved for kidney cancer in 2005, says Josep Llovet of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, lead author of the new study. In an international study of 602 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer, doctors randomly assigned half to take Nexavar and half to get placebos. Those who took Nexavar lived a median of 10.7 months, while those on placebo survived 7.9 months, according to Llovet's paper, presented at the oncology society meeting in Chicago. Nexavar doesn't cure cancer. And, as the results show, patients on average lived less than a year, Llovet says. "It's not a terribly long time to live, but we have to consider that we are here with a devastating disease," Llovet says. "We are increasing survival 44%. It's a huge impact considering that we are targeting a very advanced tumor." Llovet holds out hope that Nexavar could offer an even greater benefit when combined with surgery in patients with less advanced cancers. Nexavar belongs to new class of "targeted" therapies that are designed to slow tumor growth, but cause fewer harsh side effects than traditional chemo, which can lead to dangerously low blood counts and infections. Llovet expects Nexavar to become the new standard of care. Because it is already approved for kidney tumors, liver cancer patients could get access to the drug off-label immediately, he says. Onyx and Bayer Pharmaceuticals, which market Nexavar, financed the trial.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/matthew-kavanagh/bush-on-aids-smoke-and-m_b_50618.html&cid Matthew Kavanagh: Bush On AIDS: Smoke and Mirrors, and Broken Promises - Politics on The Huffington Post Bush On AIDS: Smoke and Mirrors, and Broken Promises Posted June 4, 2007 "Bush Seeks to Double Spending for AIDS Program" blared the headlines this week . "President Bush should be commended," trumpeted one development organization, for his "vital leadership." Great... except that Bush's plan ISN'T going to double funding and his press conference was essentially called to spin major broken promises into looking like leadership. Too bad so many took the bait. In 2003, after a major campaign by activists across the US and around the world, Bush took a historic step in announcing the $15 billion, 5 year President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief or PEPFAR. The US went from spending a few hundred million dollars to putting up billions. And those billions have leveraged billions--countries around the world increased their funding for AIDS along with the US and we made a big leap toward truly addressing the pandemic. Those billions matter--with literally millions of people who will live because of the treatment, prevention, and care that has been mobilized by the global focus on turning the tide against AIDS. But this week showed that when we aren't pushing them hard, the administration will fall back into big talk and glitzy announcements that do little to help poor people living with HIV and AIDS. Bush's so-called "doubling" of AIDS funding actually reflects only a tiny increase that's hardly worthy of the world's wealthiest nation. By design the PEPFAR program has scaled up its spending each year--and is actually set to spent billions more than the original plan trying to keep pace with the AIDS pandemic. This year, for example, the White House requested $5.4 billion for global AIDS. Simply continuing this rate for the next five years would give us $27 billion--meaning Bush is asking for an increase of at most about $3 billion over 5 years (a rate that's actually dramatically slower than our current increases that are failing to keep up with the crisis). Really, then, this week's headlines should have read, "Bush asks Congress to stop increasing AIDS funding so quickly." This is at a moment when the pandemic is growing at a rate that far outpaces our resources to cope. More people were infected with HIV last year than the year before, which in turn was more than the year before that. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria, meanwhile, is billions of dollars short of what it needs to do its work--and this year the President has proposed decreasing the US contribution by hundreds of millions of dollars. What's even more disturbing than the basic dollars, though, is that the President this week declared that he'd like to completely disregard the promise he made in 2005. That year, at the G8 meeting in Scotland, Bush and the other G8 leaders to ensure universal access to AIDS treatment by 2010. In the first five years of PEPFAR the goal was to fund treatment for 2 million people--a goal they may get near depending on how you count it. That's about 1/3 of the people in immediate need--which is a just goal since the US controls 1/3 of the global wealth. But apparently over the next 5 years Bush wants us to give up on the promise of Universal Access. As he got ready for this year's G8, the President suggested that the US should only fund programs to treat Â½ million more people. Meaning that, as we move from 6 million people to likely 9 or 10 million people who will need treatment, the US will be helping a smaller and smaller percentage of those in need. This kind of promise breaking is unworthy of our praise, to say the least. The real fair US contribution to a global AIDS response over the next 5 years is more like . Besides being less than US consumers will spent on bottled water over that 5 months worth of war So let's be clear--Bush wants to claim the mantle of global leadership on HIV/AIDS while basically suggesting that the US should do less of its share in the fight. Luckily for people living with HIV and AIDS, he's not the one in charge of appropriating money. Looks like it's up to Congress to rescue the US role on AIDS. Our organization, the Student Global AIDS Campaign , and others will be making sure they step up, but that'd be a lot easier if everyone would stop buying the smoke and mirrors act.

NewsCenter 5's Heather Unruh reported Monday that a Needham company has a test men and women can do at home that could be the first way to detect fertility trouble. "A year passed and I started getting like something's wrong here," Alba Garcia said. The Garcias tried to get pregnant for a year. But now, couples can find out if they have fertility problems in a matter of minutes with a new at-home fertility screening test. Fertell is new. The kit includes a female test that can detect a hormone level measuring egg production. It's conducted much like an at home pregnancy test and can be read in 30 minutes. "The FSH test that we do in our office -- that's actually in this kit -- is the first test we look for when a woman comes for an evaluation," Columbia University Medical Center's Dr. Harry Fisch said. For men, there's a test that measures the concentration of moving sperm -- a key indicator of sperm health. Results take 80 minutes, but the tests won't catch every fertility problem. "This test is not a guarantee that you're fertile or not. But it's a great start," Fisch said. Genosis is a company based in Needham. They say clinical trials showed their at-home fertility tests are 95 percent accurate. The Garcias finally sought help from a fertility specialist, and now, they have a daughter. But for them, this test would have been a godsend. "It would save me a year of not knowing we had a problem," Garcia said. Copyright 2007 by TheBostonChannel.com. All rights reserved.

Storm survivors are dying from the effects of both psychological and physical stress, from the dust and mold still in dwellings to financial problems to fear of crime, health experts and officials say. "There is no doubt in my mind that Katrina is still killing our residents," Orleans Parish coroner Dr. Frank Minyard said this week. "People with pre-existing conditions that are made worse by the stress of living here after the storm. Old people who are just giving up. People who are killing themselves because they feel they can&#039;t go on," Minyard said. Some say an in-depth federal analysis is needed, despite a new state report that found no significant increase in deaths in the New Orleans area from January 2006 through June 2006. The state Department of Health and Hospitals is still compiling figures for the last six months of 2006. Huge setback to Bush&#x27;s military tribunals at Guant&#xE1;namo Efficient adoption system attracts American couples to Ethiopia JFK plot was short on means and smarts Dr. Raoult Ratard, the state epidemiologist, said "the only slight increase" in deaths was in the first three months of 2006 in Orleans Parish. But New Orleans medical officials say that jump, from 11.3 per 1,000 deaths to 14.3 per 1,000, &#8212; a leap of more than 25 percent &#8212; was anything but slight. Moreover, the report doesn&#039;t take into account evacuees who died while away from the city and were returned for burial. "Our death rate was already high, that&#039;s huge," said Dr. Kevin Stephens Sr., director of the New Orleans Health Department. Some New Orleans doctors questioned the accuracy of the population figures used to determine the death rate, saying they might have been too high. DHH secretary Dr. Fred Cerise said he was comfortable with the population data, which he said came from the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The city was abandoned after Katrina struck Aug. 29, 2005, and many people did not begin returning until mid-2006. The official death tolls in New Orleans stands at about 1,100. State health officials said deaths have not been listed as Katrina-related since the end of 2005, except for bodies found under storm wreckage. But Minyard said he believes the hurricane is still behind many deaths. Dr. Ronald Kessler, professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School and head of a group that has monitored 3,000 exiled Katrina survivors, said reconstructing an individual&#039;s mental and physical state before death might help in determining exact causes of death. "There are high rates of mental health problems among the survivors and previous research has found that mental disorders are predictors of earlier death rates," Kessler said. "So putting the two together in New Orleans is not surprising." Local mental health professionals say they are encountering more people with psychological problems. "We&#039;re seeing triple the number of people with mental health problems as we were before Katrina," said Leah Hedrick, social worker at Ochsner Hospital. "Depression, suicidal, anxiety, abuse of drugs and alcohol, and along with that comes a lot more physical problems." Many storm-damaged hospitals are not operating fully, and that could help explain why other health facilities are seeing more patients. Another possible sign that there are more deaths are paid death notices in The Times-Picayune. Before Katrina, the newspaper usually printed about a page daily. Now, three and four pages are not uncommon. Stephens analyzed the death-notice pattern before and after the storm and said he believes it confirms more local people are dying. His study will be published this month in the Journal of Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, the American Medical Association&#039;s new publication on disaster management. Many church congregations scattered after Katrina, and their bulletins that carried death notices may not be publishing. But Stephens discounted that as a possible explanation for why the newspaper is receiving more death notices. Before Katrina, he said, it was routine to place death notices in both the newspaper and outlets such as church newsletters. Minyard believes the medical community&#039;s different observations reach the same conclusion, and one day will be proven correct. "Years from now when they talk about post-traumatic stress, New Orleans after Katrina will be the poster child," he said.

Those damaging rays lead to painful sunburns. To fight back, there are several new sunscreen products that fight UVA and UVB rays. Doctors say that the first rule is to make sure your sunscreen has an SPF of at least 15. Even with sunscreen, there is still one surefire way that tanners get burned. Dr. Paula Bourelly, a dermatologist, says that âpatients are not using it often enough. Usually you want to reapply a sunscreen every two or every three hours when you're out in the sun. You also want to use about an ounce for your body. That's like a shot glass, or the size of a golf ball if you don't drink." Doctors say to look for sunscreens that are âwater resistantâ â most will last about 40-minutes in water. Email will not be displayed on site. For station contact purpose only.

When she stands in the garden of her Southeast Side home, she loves to just look at the birds or watch the trees blossoming in the spring. Click to enlarge image Yvonne Wells, 59, has survived both breast cancer and ovarian cancer. She says her experience has made her appreciate the simple joys of life. More news and resources Folic acid found to cut risk of strokes In 1996, Wells was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. She survived the disease -- and the grueling treatments -- only to be diagnosed with breast cancer six years later. Kills 1 in 4 Americans So this is her day. The first Sunday of June is National Cancer Survivors Day, named in honor of Wells and 10.5 million other cancer survivors in the United States. Chicago is among more than 700 communities marking the day with parades, carnivals and art exhibits. Advocate Lutheran General Hospital's celebration includes a butterfly release. The University of Chicago's observance is being keynoted by R&B singer Patti LaBelle, who has lost three sisters to cancer. More people are surviving because of improvements in screening, detection and treatment. Still, one in four Americans dies of cancer, making it the second-leading cause of death, after heart disease. Ovarian cancer is among the more deadly forms because it is so difficult to detect early. Only 45 percent of patients survive five years. Early symptoms often are mistaken for other conditions. And that's what happened with Wells. When she complained of abdominal discomfort and bloating, her doctor said it was PMS and gave her Motrin. But the symptoms got worse. Two weeks later, Wells was doubled over in pain, unable to stand. She went to the ER and had a hysterectomy the next day. That was followed by six months of chemotherapy. Wells lost her hair, felt weak and threw up a lot. She developed a severe rash on her face and sores in her mouth. Wells also suffered "chemo brain" for about three years. Her short-term memory was impaired, and it was difficult to judge distances while driving. The treatments saved her life. But Wells still carries a mutation, in a gene known as BRCA, that greatly increases the risk of ovarian and breast cancers. Wells was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2002 after a suspicious mammogram. She underwent a lumpectomy and six more months of chemo. Fortunately, the cancer had not spread to her lymph nodes. And, compared with the regimen for ovarian cancer, chemo for breast cancer "was like a walk in the park," Wells said. Wells' sister died of breast cancer at 47. An aunt also died. And Wells said she was petrified that her daughter, Shauna, carried the BRCA mutation. But a gene test at the U. of C. was negative. That night, they went out to dinner to celebrate. Thinks about it almost every day Wells, 59, thinks about cancer almost every day. "Every time I get a pain, or something's not right with my body, I think, 'Oh, God, it's back,' " she said. Wells sees her Mercy Hospital oncologist every three months. And she has enrolled in a U. of C. study that is examining three breast cancer screening methods for high-risk women -- mammograms, ultrasounds and MRIs. In the 11 years Wells has survived cancer, she has gone to Hawaii, attended her son's wedding, worked in a payroll department, volunteered in her church, tended her garden, taken up knitting and spent many happy hours with friends and family. And in November, Wells expects to become a grandmother for the first time. "I enjoy life," she said. Make Us Your Home Page © Copyright 2007 Sun-Times News Group |

The US government on Friday issued a warning against the use of China-made toothpastes, saying they may contain a toxic chemical diethylene glycol (DEG). FDAâs warning to discard all Chinese made toothpastes was issued when the US health watchdog FDA found the presence of DEG in Chinese-made toothpastes at three stores: a Dollar Plus store in Miami, a Todo A Peso store in Puerto Rico and a store in Los Angeles. However, calling the FDAâs warning "unscientific, irresponsible and contradictory", China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) in a statement posted on its Web site late Saturday said that low levels of diethylene glycol have been deemed safe for consumption. In response to the FDA notice, AQSIQ said, "Our research shows that toothpaste containing up to 15.6 percent diethylene glycol, the chemical that the US side is concerned about, is safe, even after prolonged use." "So far we have not received any report of death resulting from using the toothpaste. The U.S. handling (of this case) is neither scientific nor responsible," AQSIQ said in the statement. Diethylene Glycol or DEG is an inexpensive chemical used in industrial products such as in antifreeze, brake fluids and various solvents. It is used by counterfeiters as a substitute for Glycerin, a relatively expensive but safe additive commonly found in food, drugs and household products. Glycerin is used as a thickening agent and a sweetener in toothpaste. DEG poisoning is an important public safety issue. This came into light when the deadly chemical was used in cold medicines in Panama resulting in the death of about 100 people. This has led to an international outcry regarding the safety standards of Chinese exports. China's food regulator said that all the toothpaste exported to the United States had been registered by the U.S. health agency for marketing in the country. They also said that a list of the ingredients in the toothpaste exported to the US had been offered to the FDA. The list included diethylene glycol. The AQSIQ further contends that the FDAâs concerns about the chemicalsâ quantity in Chinese toothpastes is useless as even EU standards allow for a certain amount of chemical, and a Chinese study in 2000 found toothpaste containing less than 15.6 percent of the drug was not harmful. FDA said that various brands such as Cooldent, Clean Rite and Oralmax have been found to be contaminated; some of them have the concentration of DEG as high as 3 to 4 percent. According to the FDA, the companies manufacturing products containing DEG are Goldcredit International Enterprises Ltd., Goldcredit International Trading Co. Ltd., and Suzhou City Jinmao Daily Chemicals Co. Ltd. The US health agency is concerned about the fact that DEG can pose a low but significant risk of toxicity and injury to children and people suffering from kidney or liver diseases, on chronic exposure to the chemical. However, experts from the Chinese Health Ministry deemed the chemical a "low-level" poison that does not accumulate in the human body. They also said that there is no evidence that the chemical in question can cause cancer or deformities. The AQSIQ has lodged a representation to the FDA and urged the US health watchdog to clarify the facts in a scientific manner at the earliest. Meanwhile, in order to limit the adverse effects, FDA has issued an import alert on Friday for all dental products containing DEG. All brands will be tested for DEG and those which contained DEG previously will have to prove that the chemical is no longer present. As per the reports, China accounts for about $3.3 million out of the $2 billion toothpaste market in America. Submitted by Wally Lama (not verified) on Mon, 2007-06-04 21:33. I dont see how China can put stuff in there products that hurt people. Does this mean if we ship the stuff back to them they would use it? Are they that dumb? Id like to know if anyone in China have gotten sick or died because of this. I also wanna know if China uses American products and if they were as bad? Boycott all of China!

Then why in the world would anyone buy anything made in communist China??? Same difference! Buy american...its the best guarantee of our security. China: a model of outstanding honesty in all things. Submitted by Average Citizen (not verified) on Mon, 2007-06-04 20:30. There is no question China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) is without a doubt much more trustworthy and scientifically superior to this United States Food and Drug Administration. China, known the world over as synonymous with the highest quality standards, would never knowingly place any human being, regardless of nationality or party affiliation, at even the slightest perceived risk. The manner and regard that the United States FDA cautioned consumers is unacceptable, especially since Diethylene Glycol is only a poison of low toxicity, and a suitable proven prefered safe alternative may cost as much as several cents more.

Reports of sexual behavior while asleep have become so common that experts on Friday released a classification system that allows doctors to better document these cases. People who engage in sleepsex "don't remember what they do, and it's their bed partners who tell them. They're mortified, and the partner complains they're being assaulted or molested," said Dr. Carlos Schenck, a sleep researcher who was lead author on the report. "Now they'll realize this is a sleep-related disorder." Since the 1990s, researchers have been exploring the range of "parasomnia" behaviors in which people do things other than sleep while sleeping. Sleepwalking, of course, is nothing new - ask Lady Macbeth - but researchers are discovering that people eat while asleep, engage in violence, and even intensely scratch themselves. "Anything that people do during the daytime, we're realizing they can do during sleep, all the instinctual or basic behaviors," Schenck, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Minnesota Medical School, said. Schenck and colleagues explored existing reports of sexual behavior during sleep and created the classification system. Their work appears in the June issue of the journal Sleep. The researchers looked at 31 cases of sleep-related sexual behavior. They found that 80 percent involved men. Only males engaged in sleep sexual intercourse (42 percent of cases) while females were more likely to engage in "sexual vocalizations." People of both genders reported incidents of sleep masturbation. In one case, they reported, "a 28-year-old woman had nightly sexual moaning and sexual fondling during sleep for 16 years that would appear within 20 minutes of falling asleep and disturb the sleep of her husband and children." In another case, a 26-year-old woman would initiate foreplay with her bed partner during sleep and then awaken and accuse him of forcing sex upon her. None of the patients reported remembering the incidents. Patients who have sex while asleep typically do not have any form of mental disorders, Schenck said. "Basically, an alarm rings in their nervous system when it shouldn't ring, and they have this partial awakening. It's a twilight state," he said. Unfortunately for the patients, "they have suspended judgment," Schenck said. "They can't monitor themselves, and they're are risk for harming themselves or someone else." In many cases, he added, bed partners reported unwanted sexual advances by a sleeping person, but sometime said they didn't mind the extra attention. The sedative clonazepam (Klonopin) is a frequent treatment for unwanted behaviors during sleep and it works in 90 percent of parasomnia cases, according to the new report. It's not clear how common sleepsex is. Dr. Robert Vorona, a sleep researcher and associate professor of internal medicine at Eastern Virginia Medical School, suspects that the true number of cases is not on the rise. "However, until sleep specialists actively question our patients about these delicate issues, we will not really know just how common or uncommon these behaviors might be, or whether these activities might be occurring more frequently," he said. As for the future, he said sleep experts - already called as experts in court cases on violence reportedly taking place during sleep - may find themselves testifying even more often. "Sleep clinicians should not be surprised to find themselves increasingly being asked to testify in controversial cases involving sexual activity during sleep," he said.

If a third test result, expected later Monday, also proves negative, Andrew Speaker -- whose air travel to his wedding in Greece set off international concerns last month -- would be considered "relatively noncontagious," said a statement from the Denver hospital. Speaker had been confined to his room, which is equipped with special air filters and negative air pressure to ensure he does not infect others with the drug-resistant bacteria, which can prove fatal. His primary care physician, Charles Daley, said Speaker is at the relatively low end of contagiousness but is contagious. The personal-injury attorney is being allowed to leave his room sporadically but only while wearing a special TB mask, and he is being kept from other patients, Daley said. He has been given antibiotics intravenously. Typically, the hospital allows drug-resistant TB patients with three consecutive negative test results to take brief, escorted walks around hospital grounds, "far from patients or any other community members," the hospital said. Speaker has received a letter from the Denver Health Authority Public Health Department, dated May 29, ordering that he be detained at National Jewish for treatment of TB "until further laboratory tests indicate that your TB is no longer likely to be contagious." Denver's order coincided with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's withdrawal of an isolation order, the first one the federal government had issued in more than 40 years. Speaker's family gave him a show of support during an appearance Monday on ABC's "Good Morning America." ( "We're in hell and we want to get out of hell," said his father and fellow Atlanta attorney Ted Speaker about the ramifications of his son's trans-Atlantic travel, carried out over objections from health officials. "I don't feel it was reckless at all." The elder Speaker said a CDC official told him before last month's flights that he was urging his son not to fly "to cover myself." Officials said "at least three times" that his son was not contagious, the father said. He added that he covertly taped the conversation and planned to release a copy of the tape, though he did not say when. "We were told that these induced sputum tests that he had were negative at that point so, by the guidelines, he was not considered infectious," said Speaker's father-in-law, Dr. Robert Cooksey, a tuberculosis researcher who has worked at the CDC in Atlanta, Georgia, for 32 years. Of his son-in-law's travels, Cooksey said, "I probably would have done the very same thing." The scientist said that "there is a little tension" from his co-workers at the CDC, "but they seem to be very understanding and very supportive." Initial TB tests on family members have come back negative, the relatives said. Next story in Health Centers for Disease Control & Prevention What are E-mail Alerts?

CDC seeks passengers at TB risk Rare TB has few treatment options Tuberculosis is caused by germs that are spread from person to person through the air. It usually affects the lungs and can lead to symptoms such as chest pain and coughing up blood. It kills nearly 2 million people each year worldwide. Because of antibiotics and other measures, the TB rate in the United States has been falling for years. Last year, it hit an all-time low of 13,767 cases, or about 4.6 cases per 100,000 Americans. "Multidrug-resistant" TB can withstand the mainline antibiotics isoniazid and rifampin. The man at the center of the current case was infected with something even worse -- "extensively drug-resistant" TB, also called XDR-TB, which resists many drugs used to treat the infection. There have been 17 U.S. XDR-TB cases since 2000, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention statistics. Source: The Associated Press &copy; 2007 Cable News Network.

There's some disagreement in the medical community -- though the closer one gets to local front-line caregivers, the stronger the consensus becomes that the storm continues to claim the lives of those who survived the immediate destruction. The controversy erupted last week when the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals released a by State Epidemiologist Dr. Raoult Ratard -- which DHH acknowledged was conducted "[i]n response to concerns about an increased death rate in Louisiana post-Katrina" -- that claimed to show the death rate in the Greater New Orleans area dropped during the first 10 months of 2006 compared to the 44 months prior to the storm. That area includes Orleans, Jefferson, St. Bernard, Plaquemines, St. James, St. John, St. Charles, St. Tammany, Tangipahoa and Washington parishes. However, the study found that Orleans Parish actually observed what the author characterized as a "slight increase" in the number of deaths during the first quarter of 2006. But that increase was from 11.3 deaths per 1,000 people to 14.3 deaths per 1,000 -- which is hardly "slight," as New Orleans Health Department Director Dr. Kevin Stephens Sr. explained to the "Slight, that's more than a 25 percent increase in the mortality rate in Orleans Parish," Stephens said. "That's a tremendous increase, a huge increase. And that's almost twice the national average." The average mortality rate for the nation as a whole is 8.1 deaths per 1,000, to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Even before Katrina, Louisiana had one of the poorest health profiles in the nation, and the storm destroyed hospitals and clinics while leaving even more Louisianans impoverished and uninsured, as noted last year in a Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies One big problem with Louisiana's mortality study is it examined only state death certificates and thus failed to account for displaced residents who died elsewhere. Stephens has conducted research based on the number of obituaries since Katrina that indicates a 47 percent increase in the area's death rate. New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin cited Stephens' statistics while discussing the health care crisis in his May 30 State of the City address , his first since Katrina. Stephens' study is scheduled to be published later this month in Disaster Medicine and Public Health Preparedness, a new journal from the American Medical Association. Stephens' claims are supported by anecdotal evidence from physicians including Dr. Patrick Breaux, a cardiologist who has cared for residents of Orleans and St. Bernard parishes for 30 years. The AP reported that Breaux "watched with dismay" as his patients' obituaries began popping up in the local newspaper, and he called it "wrong" to say there was no increase in the death rate without examining all the information. Meanwhile, Orleans Parish coroner Dr. Frank Minyard raised questions about the timing of the state's study: "I don't know if they released this study with any ulterior motives, but I think it's suspicious that they would release it now," Minyard said. "We have been telling the state that we have people who can't get medical care, can't get psychiatric care. This might even influence the decision on rebuilding Charity Hospital." on the mortality controversy, Dr. Ronald Kessler -- professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School and head of a group that's monitored 3,000 displaced Katrina survivors -- said reconstructing an individual's mental and physical state before death might help in determining exact causes of death. Indeed, local mental health professionals tell the AP that they're encountering more people with psychological problems, which in turn affect overall health: "We're seeing triple the number of people with mental health problems as we were before Katrina," said Leah Hedrick, social worker at Ochsner Hospital. "Depression, suicidal, anxiety, abuse of drugs and alcohol, and along with that comes a lot more physical problems."

Monday, June 4, 2007; Page A14 FOR YEARS, there have been rumblings that GlaxoSmithKline's diabetes drug, Avandia, might be associated with an increased risk of heart attack or other cardiovascular events. Also for years, the drug's labels have noted the risk. Then last month, the New England Journal of Medicine published a review of the available studies on Avandia's side effects that concluded that taking the medication can significantly boost patients' chances of experiencing heart trouble. Washington responded with a familiar fit of hypertension. In the space of a few days, congressional hearings had been scheduled, the Food and Drug Administration was under attack for being sloppy and slow, and the advocacy group Public Citizen was calling for the FDA to ban Avandia. Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) used the study's publication to push his proposal to reorganize the FDA's drug monitoring division. Meanwhile, Avandia users were no doubt staving off their own elevated blood pressure. Columnist Biographies, Past Columns and RSS Feeds Save & Share Article But there is good reason for the FDA to act cautiously. In an editorial after the review's publication, the Lancet, a respected British medical journal, pointed out that the two most significant studies considered did not produce many conclusions of statistical significance. The authors of the analysis admit that it suffers from significant weaknesses, among them that they did not have access to patients' medical histories. Further, the FDA has said that it has other data that contradict the analysis. A large trial is underway, the results of which will help to clarify the medication's dangers. In other words, the analysis is far from conclusive, and the FDA should not be in the business of regulating by suspicion. It always must balance potential dangers against potential usefulness of a drug. If anything, the episode makes the case for a bill that Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) recently shepherded through the Senate. The most potent criticism of the FDA's behavior in the Avandia case is that it hasn't moved fast enough to quantify the drug's dangers. The legislation would give the FDA clear authority to order post-approval studies if the regulator got a whiff of undocumented risks. The bill would also promote the pooling of public and private data on prescription drugs so that possible side effects can be discovered earlier and appropriate studies commissioned more rapidly. The House should embrace the Senate's approach.

Sport Hall of Fame Nova Scotia Community College University of King's College Last updated at 7:15 AM on 02/06/07 'Sleepsex' is often demoralizing and dangerous for bed partners Doctors have come up with the first formal classification of "sleepsex," a wide range of abnormal nocturnal behaviours that emerge during deep sleep, such as sexual sleep-talking and intercourse with total amnesia. In a review article published yesterday in the journal , researchers from the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center and Stanford University School of Medicine say more and more reports are emerging of people engaging in unusual or "atypical" sexual behaviour while asleep. Eighty per cent of cases are male-dominated. Sometimes the sleepsex is a lot better than the waking sex: one woman commented she wished her boyfriend would incorporate some of the "forceful, albeit playful, biting" and dirty talk of their sleepsex into their conscious, daytime lovemaking. But in most cases, sleepsex ends not with couples lying in bed smoking cigarettes, but in physical injuries - bruises, cuts, fractures and sexual assault - as well as shame, guilt and embarrassment. One 27-year-old man broke two fingers when he tore off the restraints he used to try to avoid moving in bed and masturbating at night. Partners describe sexsomniacs as glassy-eyed and seeming "far away." One 38-year-old man sexually assaulted his spouse during sleep for 12 years. He once tried to choke her. "Losing control over yourself during sleep in a repeated way is very demoralizing and also creates problems in the relationship. Not just sexual problems but sleep disruptions," says Carlos Schenck, lead author of the sex and sleep paper. "On top of that, you're trying to have sex or even assault your bed partner or spouse sexually. It's very disconcerting and it can cause major problems in the relationship." What's more, Schenck acknowledges that adding sleepsex or "sexsomnia" to the official medical nomenclature risks giving rapists a convenient way to beat an assault charge. "But you would need strong clinical documentation, including support from the sleep lab." The Canadian physician who first described sexsomnia says the phenomenon is almost impossible to fake. "It happens while you're asleep. It's not under voluntary control," says Dr. Paul Federoff, forensic research director of the Institute of Mental Health Research at the University of Ottawa. A Toronto judge two years ago acquitted a 33-year-old landscaper of sexual assault after ruling the man was asleep at the time. The man met a woman one night at a party. She later fell asleep on his couch and woke to find him having sex with her. The man testified that he realized he was trying to have sex with her only after going into the bathroom and discovering he was wearing a condom. Federoff says that, according to the cases of sleepsex he's aware of, the activities are automatic and don't involve "such complex behaviours as finding a condom and putting it on." No one knows how prevalent sleepsex is because the surveys haven't been done, but Federoff believes it occurs more frequently than believed. Most cases of sleepsex are due to an underlying sleep disorder, says Schenck, a senior staff psychiatrist at the Minnesota sleep disorders centre. Schenck's team did a computerized literature search of peer-reviewed journal articles and scoured sleep medicine textbooks for descriptions of sexual activity during sleep. They found four cases of men with obstructive sleep apnea who initiated sex with their partners while they were sleeping. Not only were the men asleep, they were snoring. A nasal CPAP mask cured not just the apnea, but also the sleepsex. These aren't the "nocturnal emissions," or "wet dreams" described by sex researcher Alfred Kinsey more than 50 years ago. Sexsomnia behaviours range from masturbation, moaning, vocalizations, and fondling a partner to full sexual intercourse. Some people report sexual hallucinations and delusions after waking. Chronic insomnia can cause increased libido and "compulsive sexual behaviours." You're trying to have sex or even assault your bed partner or spouse sexually.

"In medicine, we would never think to sell a drug that had not been completely shown to be safe and effective," said Dr. Julio Frenk, a former health minister for Mexico who is now a senior adviser to the Gates Foundation. "Yet we often think nothing of launching some large-scale social or health intervention without first doing the same kind of rigorous study to accurately identify the problem and most likely solutions," said Frenk, who played a critical role in creating the UW's new Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. The new institute, also supported by $20 million from the UW and state government, will be directed by one of the leading experts in this frequently controversial field focused on judging success or failure in global health practices and policies, whether by foundations, governments, corporations or private organization. "My foray into this area was motivated by frustration with a simple question: What are the biggest health problems in the world, and where are people with these problems living?" said Dr. Christopher Murray, a widely known Harvard University economist who will direct the new UW health metrics institute. "The first thing I learned is that, in global health, everyone exaggerated the problem they were working on," Murray said. There was usually nothing sinister about this, he added; it was usually simply a good-faith attempt to muster more resources for a neglected problem. Though most assistance programs aimed at fighting disease or improving poor people's health are similarly well-intended, Murray said, many still are not based on an accurate assessment of either the problem or the most effective and available means for solving it. "The history of development projects, not just in health, is littered with enormous investments that very often don't yield anything," he said. Given today's new momentum for tackling many of the massive, chronic health problems in the developing world because of financial support from the likes of the Gates Foundation, other donors and governments, Murray said it's more critical than ever to ensure that these investments succeed. "Before Chris' work, the main way we did measurements in international health, or even domestic health, was to look at mortality rates," said Dr. Judy Wasserheit, vice chairwoman for the UW's new Department of Global Health (also financed in large part, by a Gates Foundation donation of $30 million). Murray, who also served in several leadership roles at the World Health Organization before moving his operation to Harvard, developed a metric of assessing the burden of disease according to a method now known as "disability-adjusted life years" or DALYs, developed with his WHO colleague, Alan Lopez. When you look at disease through the DALY lens, said Dr. King Holmes, a world-renowned expert on infectious diseases and chairman of the UW global health department, the problems out there can look quite a bit different. "The most common cause of death in Africa is communicable diseases," Holmes noted. But when you look at the non-fatal but disabling effect of all illnesses, including mental illnesses, he said, it quickly becomes clear that death rates are not always the best measure. "What we need to know is what makes people ill and what makes them well," Holmes said. The new institute headed by Murray will have faculty appointments in global health, he said, and will include studies looking at health policy in the U.S. as well as worldwide. "There are many reasons why children don't get vaccines in poor countries," added Dr. Pat Wahl, dean of the UW School of Public Health. Barriers to immunization can include economic, political, cultural and psychological factors, Wahl said, and Murray's expertise is in teasing out all of the reasons why health-improvement projects work or don't work. "This represents a tremendous step forward for the university and for all of the global health community," Wahl said. This is not the first time the Gates Foundation has invested in the need to improve the numbers in global health. At the 2005 World Health Assembly, Gates announced a grant of $50 million to create a Health Metrics Network aimed at assisting developing countries directly. "While academic institutions have a comparative advantage in teaching and research, they are not well-positioned to assist governments or to actually change the systems that deliver information on health," said Dr. Sally Stansfield, executive secretary of the Geneva-based Health Metrics Network. Stansfield, who previously served as director of global health initiatives for the Gates Foundation, said her organization intends to collaborate closely with the new UW institute to make sure the advances achieved in Seattle are rapidly and effectively deployed at the country and community level. The impetus for creating the new UW institute appears to have come when Dr. Tachi Yamada, director of global health programs at the Gates Foundation, met with Frenk in Mexico. Frenk, who had worked with Murray at the WHO, convinced Yamada of the need for a new, independent entity that can monitor and evaluate global health projects. "Julio was pretty excited about the possibilities," said Yamada, who went on to discuss the idea with Murray. "We really need that kind of analysis to guide the decisions and decide which directions we should take in the future." Murray, since leaving the WHO, has been highly critical of the U.N. agency's ability to evaluate and monitor the effectiveness of health programs worldwide. Some at the WHO, based in Geneva, Switzerland, privately grumble that the new UW institute represents a challenge to the WHO that could undermine its authority for setting priorities in international health. "I don't see it that way at all," Yamada said. The intention, he said, is for the UW institute to work in close collaboration with the WHO -- to provide assistance and full access to the data just as an independent consultant might work with a business. There is also the concern that the new institute, having been created and funded by another rising world health organization, the Gates Foundation, might go easy on the criticism when analyzing the performance of the Seattle philanthropy's own global health efforts. "Well, that's why we're locating the institute at a world-class university with an independent advisory board," Murray said. "Universities are social institutions designed to provide for doing the kind of work that is sometimes inconvenient to powerful people." The Harvard economist and his colleagues did recently give only passing marks to the Gates Foundation's largest single health project, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization. Murray and his colleagues determined that immunization rates in countries that started with very low rates of coverage were making progress, whereas countries starting with more than 65 percent of children covered were not doing very well. "That has caused a little bit of discussion, which is the point," he said. "These kind of things need to have a demonstrable effect. Good intentions are not good enough."

Breaking news E-mail alerts Get breaking news in your inbox as it happens Change in New Orleans crime in the first quarter of 2007 compared with the same period of 2006: Violent crime - 1 - 107% 1 - Includes murder, robbery, assault Source: New Orleans Police Department By Adrienne Lewis, USA TODAY Feds target violent crime in New Orleans By Kevin Johnson, USA TODAY NEW ORLEANS &#151; The federal government is in the midst of an unprecedented intervention into the local criminal justice system here, adding more than 40 agents and prosecutors to regain some basic daily operations lost to Hurricane Katrina nearly two years ago. The effort comes as the city's violent crime increased 107% the first quarter of this year over the same time in 2006, according to the New Orleans Police Department. Superintendent Warren Riley said the increase is not an accurate measure but merely reflects the return of thousands of residents who had abandoned the city because of Katrina. Riley pointed out that crime is slightly down when compared with the last quarter of 2006. Since February, federal agents have been assigned to street duties with police as surges in violence threaten the city's recovery. "The citizens of this city desperately need protection," U.S. Attorney Jim Letten said. "There are elements of the local justice system that have failed. That is flat unacceptable, and it has to change." Federal and local agents have assembled an unusual watch list of 71 criminal suspects whose links to unsolved murders, robberies and assaults represent serious threats. The suspects &#8212; some linked to multiple killings &#8212; have at least one violent-crime conviction and might be eligible for mandatory federal sentences of five to 10 years if charged with new gun offenses. &#8226;About 22 FBI agents are assigned to combat violent crime &#8212; at least 13 embedded with homicide detectives, Riley said. &#8226;Drug Enforcement Administration agents got a temporary expansion of their authority to deal with gun crimes and other violent offenses, spokesman Michael Sanders said. The DEA also reassigned eight agents to work directly with police to help curb illegal drugs in a city where crack cocaine continues to fuel turf battles among returning dealers. &#8226;Six federal prosecutors were added to the U.S. Attorney's Office to handle the increased focus on both federal gun and drug cases. &#8226;The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which deployed six additional agents, expects to boost federal gun cases 27%, said David Harper, the ATF's top agent in New Orleans. &#8226;Mayor Ray Nagin announced that the Louisiana Air National Guard would begin nightly patrols over the city through the end of the year. But New Orleans District Attorney Eddie Jordan rejected the notion that the system had failed. "The storm interrupted our ability to prosecute cases," he said. Since last year, charges have been dropped against 3,000 suspects because of hurricane-related breakdowns in the legal system. Jordan said the storm destroyed the local crime lab and evidence needed to prosecute cases. He said most of those dismissals involved drug offenses. "The federal government is doing what it can, but this is really our battle to win," Jordan said. Riley said it will take "a minimum of a couple of years" to restore confidence. "When they see the criminal justice system working, once the citizens believe these things are happening, people will start coming forward" to help.

One 36-year-old Manhattan man even claimed nine brain surgeries for himself, along with his wife and two sons, receiving reimbursements from New York-based Group Health Incorporated totaling $142,268, federal investigators said Friday. In all, the defendants billed the company for 20 brain operations _ though none were ever performed, investigators said. GHI paid out more than $300,000 in reimbursements, based on the claims. The 36-year-old man remained at large Friday, but his co-defendants _ a 39-year-old Mount Vernon man, a 42-year-old Manhattan woman and a 37-year-old Staten Island man _ were in custody. They are likely to be arraigned next week. The indictment filed in Manhattan federal court alleges that the Mount Vernon man, an employee at a medical billing company, altered claims to the insurance company by swapping the names of people who actually underwent brain surgery with two others charged in the scheme _ the 36-year-old man and the 42-year-old woman. The fraudulent claims were then sent along with altered postoperative reports to the insurance carrier to obtain reimbursement, the indictment alleges. Ilene Margolin, a spokeswoman for GHI, told The New York Times that her company's own internal investigators first noticed the defendants' unusual claims before turning over its findings to the government.

Authorities warn against using some toothpastes Gulfnews: Authorities warn against using some toothpastes By Sunita Menon and Abbas Al Lawati, Staff Reporters Dubai: Consumers have been warned against using certain brands of Chinese toothpaste as the concerned authorities here were busy passing the buck. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday in its advisory had warned consumers to avoid using tubes of toothpastes labelled as made in China, and issued an import alert to prevent toothpaste containing the poisonous chemical diethylene glycol (DEG) from entering the US. The FDA has raised concerns that the products may contain - diethylene glycol or DEG or diglycol stearate, used in solvents. While the Ministry of Health here said the responsibility of controlling a consumer product like toothpaste lies with the municipalities, a senior official from the General Secretariat of Municipalities (GSM) said a public warning is issued after it receives a notification of safety concerns about a particular product from the Ministry of Health. Dr Eisa Al Mansouri, director of the Department of Drug Control at the ministry, said the chemical found in the Chinese toothpastes, diethylene glycol (DEG) was indeed poisonous and "could cause harm to those who ingest it". He said the responsibility of issuing a warning does not lie with the department since toothpastes are a consumer product which municipalities are responsible for. Dr Ameen Yousuf, a food and safety consultant at the GSM, said public warnings are issued after it receives a list of products about which the Ministry of Health has safety concerns. He said: "The Ministry of Health has not forwarded us any notification on these toothpastes." Yousuf said there are hundreds of the products in the market which fall in the grey area - they are neither categorised under pharmaceuticals nor in food. He said: "Usually we receive a list of such products from the ministry. We issue a public warning and then get the products off the market. Currently there is no specific body established to approve or disapprove products that fall in the grey area." Caution: FDA identifies Chinese brands The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has identified the following brands of toothpaste from China that contain DEG and are included in the import alert: Cooldent Fluoride; Cooldent Spearmint; Cooldent ICE; Dr. Cool, Everfresh Toothpaste; Superdent Toothpaste; Clean Rite Toothpaste; Oralmax Extreme; Oral Bright Fresh Spearmint Flavor; Bright Max Peppermint Flavor; ShiR Fresh Mint Fluoride Paste; DentaPro; DentaKleen; and DentaKleen Junior. - Source: FDA News Get Nation as a news feed Authorities warn against using certain brands of toothpastes New rules issued to weed out unlicensed spas School takes bullies head on Two months in jail and fine for sheltering illegals Naturalisation and residency chiefs told to set sights higher Authorities warn against using some toothpastes Interactive: The Smoker&#39;s Body Inventions to boost healthcare in UAE New rules to weed out unlicensed spas Funds to aid eye disease research Desert Rose set to bloom at Ghaf Art Gallery POLICE AND THE COURTS Youth claims two men raped and molested him in deserted area Death row rapist wins reprieve on appeal Suspect says he lost cool at the sight of alcohol Road closed till October next year First toll gate installed near Garhoud Bridge Cabinet move to curb illegals Films can aid communication between cultures, says Redford POLICE AND THE COURTS Two men admit to having sex with visitor Software keeps moviegoers updated Part of Al Ittihad Road to be closed for upgrade function SubmitPoll() { //var MyWIn = window.open('http://archive.gulfnews.com/loading_poll.html', 'WinPoll', 'width=420,height=220,scrollbars=yes'); var URL ='../../loading_poll.html'; var agt=navigator.userAgent.toLowerCase(); if (agt.indexOf("safari") != -1) URL= ''; var MyWIn = window.open(URL, 'WinPoll', 'width=420,height=220,scrollbars=yes'); } I travel out of the UAE for a holiday: Four or more times a year Jobs at Gulf News &copy; Al Nisr Publishing LLC 2007.

It's called "heeling," named after Heelys, the most popular brand. They're sold in 70 countries and are so hot that their Carrollton, Texas, maker, Heelys Inc., recently landed atop BusinessWeek's annual list of fastest growing companies. But doctors from Ireland to Singapore have reported treating broken wrists, arms and ankles; dislocated elbows and even cracked skulls in children injured while wearing roller shoes. Over a 10-week period last summer, 67 children were treated for injuries from Heelys or strap-on wheels called Street Gliders at Temple Street Children's University Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, according to a report in the June edition of Pediatrics. From September 2005 through December 2006, one death and at least 64 roller-shoe injuries were reported to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, a spokesman said last week. And doctors in Singapore reported last year that 37 children had been treated for similar injuries at a hospital there during a seven-month period in 2004. None were wearing protective gear. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, based in Rosemont, Ill., this week is issuing new safety advice that recommends helmets, wrist protectors and knee and elbow pads for kids who wear wheeled shoes. "As these shoes are sold in department stores, parents buying them may develop a false sense of security - that they are like any other shoe," said Dr. James Beaty, academy president and a pediatric orthopedic surgeon in Memphis. Heelys and their knockoffs look like gym shoes, but with wheel sockets in each heel. They can be used for walking, but the wheels pop out when users shift their weight to their heels. Balancing on the wheels can be tricky, especially for novices. In the Irish study, most injuries were in new users and occurred when kids fell backward while trying to transfer their body weight. Dr. Leon Benson of Evanston Northwestern Healthcare in Evanston, Ill., recalled treating a 9-year-old girl who'd had her Heelys for just a week when she fell and broke both wrists. Nine-year-old Noah Woelfel of Davidsonville, Md., wasn't a novice but still tripped and fell, breaking several fingers and wrist bones in his right hand last year. "All it took was a tiny piece of gravel in the driveway that went up in the wheel and stopped him cold," said his mother, Nancy. "He required surgery and pins, and he was six weeks without using his hand, right at the beginning of school." She threw the removable wheels away and said other parents should know about the risks. Dr. Dominic Catanese, a foot specialist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, said balancing on heels can strain feet and Achilles tendons. He has treated several Heelys-related ankle injuries and won't let his 7-year-old daughter have the shoes. "She wants them. Not happening. Just like I took away her trampoline" after reading about trampoline injuries. "It went right to Goodwill," Catanese said. Heelys in April said a study it commissioned shows that their shoes have a safer injury rate than skateboarding, inline skating and even swimming. The shoes are sold with safety information including a recommendation to wear protective gear. The company says it has shipped more than 10 million pairs since their introduction in 2000. Heelys reported first-quarter income of $8.5 million, five times higher than last year. Still, some walkers find heelers who zip in and out of crowds a nuisance, and many schools and shopping malls have banned them. Kelly Ford, 14, used to cruise down the halls of her Chicago grammar school in Heelys - a practice that led teachers to confiscate some kids' wheels. Now a high school freshman, Ford has outgrown her Heelys. She said kids who wear them won't pay much attention to safety warnings. "I don't think any kid is going to want to wear a helmet to school," Ford said. She thinks Heelys are being unfairly targeted. "It's just like, let your kid have fun. I think they're fine," Ford said. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free! The latest news video from KOMO.

Nexavar, made by Bayer, gave patients with advanced liver cancer 44 percent more time to live, compared to patients who did not receive the drug, according to results presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, in Chicago. Results of a major clinical trial with Nexavar (sorafenib) were, in fact, so successful that the trial was halted early, the researchers announced. "This is the first systemic therapy to prolong survival in [liver cancer] patients," said Dr. Joseph Llovet, lead author of the study and director of research in liver cancer at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. "This is a new reference standard for systemic therapy of [liver cancer] patients after 30 years of research and more than 100 randomized controlled trials performed." Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, added, "This is going to change the standard of practice." Liver cancer is the third leading cause of cancer death in the world and often causes death within a year of diagnosis. About 40 percent of liver cancers (up to 80 percent in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa) are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Surgery is sometimes possible, and radiation and chemotherapy can also be options. But there is no systemic treatment, meaning a medication that enters the bloodstream. "There is no established standard of care for liver cancer even though it is one of the leading causes of death," said Dr. A. William Blackstock, a Wake Forest University radiation oncology professor who moderated a Monday news conference to announce the study results. Nexavar, which is taken in tablet form, is already approved in the United States for treating advanced kidney cancer. It is being studied for various other cancers; results of some of those studies are also being presented at ASCO annual meeting. In this study, 602 patients with advanced liver cancer were randomly assigned to receive either 400 milligrams of Nexavar twice a day or a placebo for six months. Patients receiving the drug lived a median of 10.7 months, compared with only 7.9 months for those on a placebo. Time to cancer progression was 5.5 months in the Nexavar group, versus only 2.8 months in the placebo group. The findings were so positive that the study was terminated early. "We recommended ending the trial early because of survival advantages favoring the sorafenib group," said Llovet. Side effects were similar in the two groups, the most common being diarrhea, skin reactions, fatigue and bleeding. "Sorafenib was well tolerated with manageable side effects," Llovet said. A second study presented Monday at the cancer meeting offered a bit of good news for colorectal cancer patients. When chemotherapy was given both before and after surgery to remove liver metastases in colorectal cancer patients, the risk of the liver tumor recurring was reduced almost 30 percent. "A few years ago, we had only palliation to offer these patients and survival lasted no longer than six months," said Dr. Bernard Nordlinger, lead author of the study and chairman of surgery and oncology at Ambroise Pare Hospital in Paris. "This treatment should be proposed as a new standard for these patients." One million people are diagnosed with colorectal cancer each year; up to half will see their cancer spread to the liver. Liver tumors are removed when possible, but only 30 percent to 35 percent of patients who have liver metastases survive five years after surgery. Adding the targeted therapy Erbitux (cetuximab) to chemotherapy reduced the risk of metastatic colorectal cancer spread by 15 percent. The drug is currently approved as a second-line or third-line therapy, not as the first option. These new results indicate that Erbitux has promise as a first-line treatment, the researchers said. for more on liver cancer.

These findings were released today at the 43rd annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago, Illinois. The phase III international, multi centre Nexavar trial, called SHARP Sorafenib HCC Assessment Randomized Protocol, randomized and evaluated liver cancer patients who had no prior systemic therapy. The primary objective of the study was to compare overall survival in patients administered Nexavar versus those administered placebo. Median overall survival was 10.7 months in Nexavar-treated patients compared to 7.9 months in those taking placebo. Canadian trial sites included Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto and Winnipeg. "Currently there are no therapies that significantly improve the length of survival in the thousands of patients with advanced, unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma or primary liver cancer. These important findings demonstrate the compelling study results of Nexavar as the new standard of care for the first-line treatment of HCC," said Dr. Jennifer Knox, SHARP trial investigator, Clinical Oncologist, Toronto. The study data monitoring committee in agreement with Bayer, halted the SHARP trial in February 2007, based on a pre-planned interim analysis that proved an overall survival benefit for Nexavar. In the SHARP trial, there were no significant differences in treatment-emergent serious adverse events between the Nexavar (51.5 per cent) and placebo-treated (54.3 percent) The incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events occurring at a higher incidence (greater than or equal to two per cent) in subjects in the sorafenib group versus the placebo group were diarrhea (11 percent vs. two percent), skin reactions in the hands and feet (eight percent vs. one percent), fatigue (10 percent vs. 15 percent), bleeding (six percent vs. nine percent) and alopecia (hair loss). Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common form of liver cancer and is responsible for about 90 per cent of the primary malignant liver tumors in adults. It is the fifth most common cancer in the world and the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Mortality rates of liver cancer in Canada are on the rise, and for 2007, it is estimated that there will be approximately 1,350 newly diagnosed cases of liver cancer, an estimated half of which will be fatal. Liver cancer is more prevalent in men than women, with 1,050 new diagnoses in men, compared to 300 in Nexavar targets both the tumor cell and tumor vasculature and is the only oral multi-kinase inhibitor that does not require patients to interrupt their treatment schedule. In preclinical studies, Nexavar has been shown to target members of two classes of kinases known to be involved in both cell proliferation (growth) and angiogenesis (growth of new blood vessels) - two important processes that Nexavar works by slowing tumour growth and by cutting off the blood supply to the tumour (angiogenesis). Nexavar acts on proteins called kinases which include RAF kinase, VEGFR-2, VEGFR-3, PDGFR-(beta), KIT, FLT-3 and RET. Nexavar is currently approved in nearly 50 countries, including Canada, the United States and in the European Union, for the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer. In 2006, Therapeutic Products Directorate of Health Canada (TPD) granted a Notice of Compliance with Conditions (NOC/c) for Nexavar for treatment of patients with locally advanced/metastatic renal cell (clear cell) carcinoma who have failed prior cytokine therapy or considered unsuitable for such therapy. This authorization reflects the promising nature of the clinical evidence which will require additional confirmatory data. Products approved under Health Canada's NOC/c policy have demonstrated promising benefit, are of high quality and possess an acceptable safety profile based on a benefit/risk assessment for the approved use. Nexavar is currently marketed in Canada for renal cell (clear cell) carcinoma, however, the product is not reimbursed by the government. In addition, it is being evaluated by Bayer, international study groups, government agencies or individual investigators as a single agent or combination treatment in a wide range of cancers, including as adjuvant therapy for kidney cancer, liver cancer, metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer. "Although originally approved for use in the treatment of advanced kidney cancer, HCC is the second tumor type in which Nexavar has demonstrated a clinical benefit," said Dr. Shurjeel Choudhri, senior vice president, head of medical and scientific affairs, Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. "We will continue to conduct a thorough and ongoing clinical program that could bring the potent cancer-fighting properties of Nexavar to an even broader number of patients in the coming years." Important safety considerations for Canadian patients taking Nexavar Based on the currently approved product monograph for the treatment of patients with advanced kidney cancer, hypertension may occur early in the course of therapy and blood pressure should be monitored weekly during the first six weeks of therapy and treated as needed. Incidence of bleeding regardless of causality was 15 per cent for Nexavar vs. eight percent for placebo and the incidence of treatment-emergent cardiac ischemia/infarction was 2.9 percent for Nexavar vs. 0.4 percent for placebo. Most common treatment-emergent adverse events with Nexavar were diarrhea, rash/desquamation, fatigue, hand-foot skin reaction, alopecia, and nausea. Grade 3/4 adverse events were 38 per cent for Nexavar vs. 28 percent for placebo. Women of child-bearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant and women with infants should be advised against breast-feeding. In cases of any severe or persistent side effects, temporary treatment interruption, dose modification or permanent discontinuation should be considered.

Jobs @ The Day HIV/AIDS Still A Killer President Bush's proposal to bolster funding to fight AIDS in undeveloped countries is a good thing, but HIV/AIDS also remains a problem in America. This newspaper has found fault with President Bush in the past. But it supports his latest initiative proposing a $30 billion, five-year extension of his emergency AIDS relief program that has brought antiviral drugs to more than 1 million people in undeveloped nations since it was started in 2003. HIV/AIDS is a worldwide problem. Globally, some 40 million people are afflicted and despite improved prevention efforts; the number of diagnoses is growing. The President&#39;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, known as PEPFAR, is not perfect, but it has been hailed by AIDS advocates, including the Washington-based Global AIDS Alliance, as worthy of passage. In addition to bringing medicine to people who desperately need it, PEPFAR stresses abstinence before marriage, fidelity and use of condoms. It also funds male circumcision, which studies have shown can reduce new infections in men by at least 60 percent. Though it may not generate the headlines it once did, HIV/AIDS remains a serious health issue, and not just in faraway places, but here at home, too. The New London-based Alliance for Living, which has been serving people in southeastern Connecticut with HIV/AIDS since the late 1980s, averages 200 to 220 clients at any given time. Since Jan. 1 of this year, it has accepted 14 new clients, which puts it on track with last year when it added 32 cases to its rolls. Over the past two years, the agency has buried 22 clients. While protease inhibitors, or drug cocktails concocted to help stave off HIV/AIDS, gave hope to many people when they were first introduced more than a decade ago, they also created complacency, and new problems. Over an extended period of time, use of the medicines causes other life-threatening conditions. And their availability has made some people think they can beat the infection if they get it. They can&#39;t. Today it is estimated that there are 1 million people living with HIV in the United States, and about 40,000 new infections occur each year. About 70 percent of the new cases occur in men and 30 percent in women. By race, 54 percent of the new infections are diagnosed among African-Americans, and 64 percent of the new infections in women occur in African-American women. The data also shows that 75 percent of the new infections in women are heterosexually transmitted, and that half of all new infections occur in people 25 or younger. Clearly, HIV/AIDS is a still a problem in America. While President Bush is right to think globally, citizens here must act locally. Michael Giconi, assistant director of the Alliance for Living, cautions that the crisis is not over, and that people are still dying of AIDS. &#8220;We need to keep talking about HIV and AIDS and we need to realize that it is here in our backyard,&#8221; he said. The Centers for Disease Control has recommended HIV screening for patients in all health-care settings after the patients are notified that the testing will be performed, and Mr. Giconi believes that is a very good idea. He also believes that people are wrong to think HIV/AIDS is no longer a death sentence. He is right. People are still dying, and regrettably, too many are still becoming infected. President Bush is taking steps to combat AIDS. Citizens here need to be on top of the problem, too.

This weekend, about two dozen transplant specialists and representatives from patient groups are meeting in Ottawa to draw up plans for Canada's own public cord-blood bank. Daniel Stanton, 8, left, shown with brother, Thomas, and parents Mike and Liset, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia early in 2005. His life was saved thanks to an anonymous woman who opted to donate her newborn's umbilical cord to a cord blood bank. Pat McGrath, The Ottawa Citizen Email to a friend Once considered medical waste, the stem cell-rich blood found in the umbilical cords of newborn babies is now considered a valuable tool in fighting leukemia, immune diseases and inherited blood diseases like sickle cell anemia. Expectant mothers willing to donate cords must agree in advance of the birth. The blood is extracted from the cord and frozen. It is believed that cord blood can be stored for at least 10 years. Last year, 45 people in Canada were treated with stem cells from cord blood -- almost all of it from donors outside Canada. An estimated 400 more patients whose lives are in danger could benefit from cord blood stem cell therapy, according to Canadian Blood Services figures. Those patients have not been able to find a suitable match, even though there is a worldwide inventory of about 150,000 cord-blood samples held in 50 public cord-blood banks. Daniel Stanton, now 8, was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia early in 2005. After chemotherapy failed to have an effect, doctors began combing international registries for a cord-blood match. Donations of bone marrow, peripheral blood products and cord blood can all be used as sources of stem-cell transplantation. However, because matching a recipient to cord blood is more lenient than bone marrow matches, more and more cord blood is being used. Dr. Martin Champagne, pediatric oncologist at Sainte-Justine Hospital in Montreal, has had experience with more than 100 cord-blood transplants since 1995. With bone marrow donations, about one-third of child patients can't find a match. Another 20 per cent wait too long to be matched, he said. "With cord blood, we will be able to double the number of transplants," said Dr. Champagne, who is to attend the meeting this weekend. However, he also fears that accessing cord blood from the U.S. will become increasingly complicated. "I suspect it will be more and more difficult to transport these life-giving cells over the border." Typically, cord-blood transplant patients will receive doses of chemotherapy to knock out their own bone marrow cells, which are then "rescued" with a source of new stem cells. Daniel's transplant, an intravenous procedure much like a blood transfusion, was performed in Toronto on July 28, 2005. It took eight months for him to recover well enough to return to school. Now, less than two years after the transplant, there has been no evidence of a relapse. The mother of the newborn who saved Daniel's life had no idea when or where her baby's cord blood would be used. Daniel's mother, Liset Stanton, would love to thank the donor, but she doesn't even know what country it came from, or even how many years ago it was donated.

According to the report, a wide range of sleep disorders can carry with them a tendency to perform numerous sexual behaviors from masterbating and moaning, to actually making a sexual advance towards your partner, while in a state between sleep and wakefulness. Researchers call these behaviors Sexsomnias, which are recognized as subtypes of parasomnia, which is a group of disorders including sleepwalking, sleep talking and night terrors. The report, which is published in the Journal Sleep states that sexual behaviors can affect a wide range of people with sleep disorders. Dr. Carlos H. Schenck, the lead author of the report and a senior staff psychiatrist at the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center in Minneapolis, states that "We wanted to call attention to how virtually all known categories of sleep disorders carry a risk for inappropriate sexual behaviors." Sexsomnia can occur after a "disorder of arousal" which refers to people who are sleeping becoming aroused, entering into "twilight sleep-wake state" where they act without any form of judgement.

Cord blood stem cells are taken from the umbilical cord at birth and can be frozen indefinitely. The cells are fast becoming a preferred alternative to bone marrow transplants for children with certain cancers. Since the stem cells are more flexible than bone marrow, the match between donor and recipient does not have to be as close. The vast majority of cord blood used for transplants in Canada comes from donors in other countries because Canada lacks a national, taxpayer-supported cord blood bank. Outside of Montreal and Edmonton, most cord blood collection in the country is done commercially, with parents paying upwards of $1,000 in annual fees to store their child's cord blood for their exclusive use. Canada needs a national, public cord blood bank, said Dr. Martin Champagne of Ste-Justine Hospital in Montreal. "We believe that it is very important that we also contribute to the international registry of cord blood banks," Champagne said. This weekend, Canadian Blood Services will recommend that it be given funding to establish such a bank. Dr. Cliff Librach, who runs the private Create Cord Blood Bank in Toronto, also supports a public bank, but said some parents will want to keep their child's cord blood. "If they want to bank those cells for themselves, for their own family, then they should have the right to do that," Librach said. When Lucas Ditecco of Ste. Julie, Que., received two bouts of chemotherapy and a cord blood stem cell transplant for an acute form of leukemia two years ago, the cord blood cells came from a baby boy in Germany. "That mother, when she delivered her baby, she gave life to two persons," said Lucca's mother, Marie-France Langlais. A national cord blood bank won't mean every child's cord blood is saved and stored. Experts said a representative sample of 10,000 donations from the country's diverse population would probably be enough for use in Canada and international recipients when there is a match.

The 19-year-old man tested positive for the H5N1 strain of the virus early this week after being admitted to the Institute of Tropical Medicine in Hanoi, a doctor there told AFP. The doctor, who asked not to be named, said the victim had been admitted on May 19 and was now in a stable condition. The daily Lao Dong said the patient had been working for a poultry slaughterhouse in the capital before he was taken to the Institute with a high fever and severe respiratory problems. The director of Hanoi's Bach Mai hospital told the paper two other suspected bird flu victims had been admitted on Thursday and Friday, one of whom died late Friday. Their samples are being tested in Hanoi, she said. Last week Vietnam reported that a 30-year-old farmer had been infected with the deadly bird flu virus, the country's first human case since November 2005. The victim was admitted to Bach Mai hospital in a critical condition but is now improving. Bird flu has hit 14 of Vietnam's 64 provinces. The government has called for urgent measures to deal with the situation and to raise awareness of the dangers of bird flu. Between 2003 and November 2005, Vietnam was one of the countries worst hit by bird flu with 42 deaths. The country, however, won international applause for its transparency and effectiveness in curbing the epidemic. H5N1 has killed almost 200 people and ravaged poultry flocks worldwide since 2003. World Health Organisation experts say a bird flu pandemic among humans would kill millions of people across the globe. - AFP Car Insurance for Women USA Green Card Program Win Now For Real Blood of bird flu victims offers treatment Four test positive for bird flu in Wales Bird flu found at two more Pakistani farms Now you can get all your news - from politics in South Africa, the quirkiest stories in Step Beyond, the latest from the worlds of Motoring, Entertainment and Business - in one place. and you'll have all the latest news at your fingertips.

Speaker, 31, an Atlanta attorney quarantined with a dangerous strain of tuberculosis apologized to his fellow plane passengers and said he was told he wasn't contagious or a threat to anyone. MANDATORY CREDIT. WATERMARK MAY NOT BE REMOVED OR ALTERED IN ANY WAY. DENVER- The man infected with drug-resistant tuberculosis who set off an international health scare could be allowed outside of his isolated hospital room if a test for the bacteria is negative, a hospital official said Monday. The patient, Andrew Speaker, is being treated at the National Jewish Medical and Research Center. Two tests of his sputum have been negative, meaning they have not shown the presence of TB bacteria, and results of a third test were expected late Monday or Tuesday, hospital spokesman William Allstetter said in a statement. If the third is negative, Speaker, 31, would be considered "relatively noncontagious" and could be allowed brief escorted trips outside his room wearing a mask, Allstetter said. But he stressed that such a finding would not mean Speaker cannot transmit the disease, saying the bacteria could still grow in Speaker's lungs and sputum. Drug-resistant TB patients who do venture outside are kept far from patients and anyone else in the community so they pose no risk of infecting others. Earlier Monday, Speaker's parents and in-laws stressed in an interview on "Good Morning America" that he would never have traveled to Europe for his wedding and honeymoon if he thought he was contagious. "We're in hell and we want to get out of hell," said the man's father, Ted Speaker. Speaker's parents denied that their son was reckless. "We are not people of reckless behavior, nor is Andrew," said his mother, Cheryl Speaker. If he thought he was contagious, she said: "He would have been the first one not to go." Ted Speaker said he taped a meeting in which a doctor says three times that his son was not contagious though the doctors preferred that he not fly. The elder Speaker said he will release the tape at some point. While many people were outraged by Speaker's actions, his father didn't seemed worried when asked about possibly being served with a lawsuit over the case. "If they want to serve me go ahead," Ted Speaker said. "I am not at fault. My son is not at fault." Before leaving last month for Europe for his wedding and honeymoon, Speaker has said he was advised by Fulton County, Ga., health authorities that he was not contagious or a danger to anyone. Officials told him they would prefer he didn't fly, but no one ordered him not to, he said. Speaker was in Europe when he learned tests showed he had not just TB, but an extremely drug-resistant strain known as XDR. Despite warnings from federal health officials not to board another long flight, he flew home for treatment, fearing he wouldn't survive if he didn't reach the U.S., he said. The family said that a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention official told them the only way for him to get back to America from Italy would be to hire a private plane. But the parents said they are not rich and could not have easily afforded a private jet. "We work hard," said Betsy Cooksey, a school teacher and mother of Andrew Speaker's new bride, Sarah. "We're not in careers that are high paying." Speaker's father-in-law, Robert Cooksey, works for the CDC, where he specializes in tuberculosis and other bacteria. "It's the height of irony," he said of the situation. Robert Cooksey also reiterated that Andrew Speaker did not get the illness from him. Andrew Speaker was quarantined May 25, after his return from his honeymoon, in the first such action taken by the federal government since 1963. After being hospitalized in Atlanta, he was flown to Denver on Thursday for treatment. Speaker was taking antibiotics to battle a tennis-ball-size infection in his lung. Doctors said his treatment could include surgery to remove the infected tissue if the drugs don't work. Tests so far indicate Speaker's risk of spreading the infection are low, doctors said. Eleven people who were on flights with Speaker have tested negative for the disease, health officials in South Carolina said Monday. More than two dozen University of South Carolina Aiken business students were on an eight-hour flight to Paris with Speaker. (This version CORRECTS last graf to correct 11 tested were on 'flights,' instead of an eight-hour flight to Paris.)

The World Health Organisation says that the safest way to reduce smoking is to ensure smoke free environment. This was made known at the launch of this year&#39;s World No Tobacco Day, on the theme "Smoke Free Environments" in Tema. According to the World Health Organization&#39;s Country Representative, Dr. Joaquin Saweka, half of all regular smokers will be killed by tobacco if the current pattern being experienced should continue. He said research indicates that tobacco will kill about 10 million people each year by 2020 with 70% of these deaths occurring in developing countries. Dr. Saweka stated that it is equally alarming to note that hundreds of thousands of people who have never smoked die each year from illnesses related to inhalation of other people&#39;s tobacco smoke. "Half of all children worldwide are exposed to tobacco smoke, particularly in the home" he said. According to estimates, at least 200,000 workers die each year from the activities of smokers although they are not directly involved in the act but are exposed to it at the workplace and at other social gatherings. He mentioned that tobacco smoke contains more than 4,000 known chemicals of which more than 50 are carcinogens and causes serious illness among adults and children. According to Dr.Saweka, exposure to second-hand smoke also carries economic costs for individuals, companies and the society at large. Second-hand smoke also causes severe forms of heart disease and many respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses. He stated that the tobacco industry has constantly misled and misinformed the public on both the health risks and dangers of passive smoking and the economic consequences of banning smoking. "Most of the countries of our Region have legislation that prohibits smoking in public places but effective implementation remains a problem" he stated. He noted that article 8 of the WHO Frame Convention on Tobacco Control which has now been ratified by 31 countries of the region, including Ghana provides for the adoption of measures to protect people against exposure to tobacco smoke. It also identifies proven measures for reducing the health risks associated with exposure to second-hand smoke. Dr. Saweka noted that countries that have promulgated laws banning smoking in public places are seeing a reduction in the consumption of tobacco products partly because such bans encourage people to quit smoking. He said this year&#39;s World No Tobacco Day stresses that 100% smoke-free environment is the only effective strategy for reducing exposure to tobacco smoke to safe levels. On his part, the Deputy Minister of Health, Samuel Owusu-Agyei said there is no doubt that tobacco use has reached the proportion of a global epidemic, impacting more negatively on developing countries such as Ghana. "Our main duty as a Ministry is to gather the facts and make them known to all other partners so that together we can take action in diverse ways to create awareness on the harm tobacco use" he stated. The Deputy Minister said that global trends indicate that while tobacco use is falling in the developed world, it keeps rising in the developing countries. Mr. Owusu- Agyei said scientific evidence gathered over the past two decades indicates that tobacco is a silent killer and also becoming a greater cause of death and disability than any single disease in the world. "The theme was based on the fact that it is not only smokers who are affected by smoking but non-smokers who inhale smoke from smokers suffer many of the diseases of active smokers" he stressed. He appealed to the media and the private sector to team up with the ministry to prevent smoking in the society. &copy; 2007 Public Agenda. All rights reserved.

The problem, however, authorities allege, is that Michael Biscotti and his spouse never had the operations, nor did three others, who, collectively bilked an insurance company of more than $300,000 over three years. The defendants submitted 20 bogus claims to Group Health Insurance between April 2003 and September 2006. They have been indicted on mail fraud and health-care fraud charges. The alleged mastermind, Charles Pritchett, 39, of upstate Mount Vernon, tapped into a medical billing company's system, and using details from two legitimate patients' records, submitted the bogus claims, along with altered post-operative reports for Biscotti and the two other defendants. Co-defendants Stanley Cannella and Dorothy L. Smith were each reimbursed for nine purported surgeries on themselves and their families, court papers said. Cannella, 36, received $142,268, while Ms. Smith received $131,397. Biscotti, Cannella and Ms. Smith each potentially face a maximum of 30 years in prison, if convicted, Pritchett faces up to 90 years behind bars. All the defendants, except for Pritchett are city workers. - Contributed by Frank Donnelly Username (Don't Have a Username?

"My husband is a 25-year cancer survivor. So when Relay for Life came to Regina in 2002, and because we had journeyed with cancer since 1982, I just embraced this event. It was all about the celebration of life and coming together,'' said Redler, who helped organize the survivor pep rally. "We have always said cancer is a family disease. Even though it was my husband who was diagnosed with cancer our whole family went through the journey with cancer and we all survived it.'' The Royal Saskatchewan Museum held the Relay for Life Survivor Rally on Sunday. Email to a friend On Sunday more than 300 survivors and their families took part in the third-annual survivor rally which was held this year at the Royal Saskatchewan Museum. "When I heard about this event I told my husband, 'I need to do this for you honey.' I sat beside his bed every time Tony had cancer, and he had cancer four times between 1982 and 1995, and every time I would sit there and feel so helpless and I couldn't do anything,'' Redler said. "I said 'I need to do this for you. I need to celebrate life. I need to put on a party for you.' And then I got to meet the other 175 survivors that joined that first year and I said 'Hey, this is way bigger than you. Now we need to reach every survivor we know and invite them.''' The rally is a chance for survivors, who will be walking the victory lap during the June 15 Relay for Life fundraising walk to meet each other and share their stories. "We don't recruit survivors. We simply invite them to the party and if they want to celebrate with us on June 15 we are going to give them a day that they will not forget,'' Redler said. "We are going to have an amazing event. We are going to have more teams than we have every had in the past. We are preparing for 500 survivors to come out and join us,'' she said, adding 86 teams are already registered for the relay. Jennie and Benny Yee will be among the survivors. Jennie was diagnosed with stage 4 lymphoma which had spread to her bone marrow in 2000 and her husband was diagnosed with cancer in 2004. "When I learned I had cancer I cried for three days and on the fourth day I prayed to God to take away my worries. I said I'm not going to worry about it if you want me to go, because I could be hit by a car crossing the street and die,'' Jennie said. Instead of focusing on dying of cancer the Regina couple said they acknowledged they had cancer and focused on celebrate each day as survivors which has helped others within the Chinese community break down that wall of silence around the disease.

An official with the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine said the U.S. importers have submitted the formula of China's toothpaste exports to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before shipment and the content level of diethylene glycol (DEG) were indicated on the packaging. "All the toothpastes were registered with the FDA and approved to be distributed in the , so they contradicted themselves by warning consumers to avoid using China-made toothpastes and detaining shipments from China," said the official. On June 1, the FDA warned consumers to avoid using tubes of toothpaste labeled as made in China, and issued an import alert to prevent toothpaste containing the poisonous chemical DEG from entering the United States. According to the FDA's website, FDA inspectors identified and detained one shipment of toothpaste at the U.S. border, containing about 3 percent DEG by weight. They found and tested toothpaste products from China located at a distribution center and a retail store. The highest level found was between 3-4 percent by weight. In 2000, Chinese experts claimed after carrying out tests on 1,965 people that toothpaste containing less than 15.6 percent of DEG was harmless for humans. So far there have been no reports of people being poisoned by toothpaste containing DEG. In addition, the U.S. side allows the use of DEG in food addictive according to its laws and the FDA said on its website "it is not aware of any U.S. reports of poisonings from toothpaste containing DEG". The safety of Chinese food and drug products has been in the news lately. China has blamed Panamanian traders for falsifying documents on a Chinese chemical product that resulted in the deaths of dozens of Panamanian people who ingested tainted cough syrup and confirmed the alleged toxic toothpaste imported from China to Panama met safety standards. "Over the past two years, the acceptance rate of China's food exports to the United States has hovered around 99 percent, slightly higher than that of U.S. food exports to China," said said Li Yuanping, an official in charge of food import and export safety.

Why not get Married! New research suggests that getting married can lift your mood, even though married life may not be as uplifting. "Based on previous research, we hypothesized that people who are depressed would have worse marital quality and would therefore experience fewer benefits from marriage but that is not what we found," researcher Adrianne Frech said in a statement. The team pulled data for their study which is published in the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour, from the National Survey of Families and Households. They were able to learn that people who were depressed to a certain degree had relief of their depression upon getting married. Results from the study also showed that married people who are depressed, tended to report less marital happiness and more marital conflict but overall, their moods were more upbeat.

This phenomenon called "sexsomnia" or "sleepsex" is occurring with increasing frequency among patients prompting experts to define it along with some parameters. Sleepsex involves either masturbating or making advances even while in deep sleep, the study said. Sleepsex is often mentioned in the same set of disorders which include sleepwalking, sleep talking and night terrors. A collective term used for the above conditions is parasomnia. Lead researcher Dr. Carlos H. Schenck of the Minnesota Regional Sleep Disorders Center said that some inappropriate sexual behaviors occur during wakefulness as well. "We wanted to call attention to how virtually all known categories of sleep disorders carry a risk for inappropriate sexual behaviors," said Schenck. He gave an example called Kleine-Levin syndrome in which affected patients could sleep for 16 to 18 hours at a stretch, but when awake could indulge in "hypersexual" behavior. "Basically, an alarm rings in their nervous system when it shouldn't ring, and they have this partial awakening. It's a twilight state," he said, adding that such people might harm themselves because they have no control over their behavior. The study said that clonazepam (Klonopin) could take care of such problems in 90 percent of the cases.

Sneakers with retractable wheels in the soles &#8212; Heelys is the most popular brand &#8212; are all the rage among kids around the world. Doctors, however, warn about the risk of injury. CHICAGO | Wheeled sneakers let kids zip down sidewalks, but doctors say the trendy shoes also can send children rolling into emergency rooms on stretchers. The craze is called &#8220;heeling,&#8221; named after Heelys, the most popular brand of wheeled sneakers. The shoes are sold in 70 countries and are so hot that their Texas-based maker, Heelys Inc., recently landed atop &#8217;s annual list of fastest-growing companies. However, doctors have reported treating broken wrists, arms and ankles; dislocated elbows and even cracked skulls in children who were injured while wearing roller shoes. In a 10-week period last summer, 67 children were treated at Temple Street Children&#8217;s University Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, for injuries from Heelys or strap-on wheels called Street Gliders. The data appear in in the June issue of the journal From September 2005 through December 2006, one death and at least 64 roller-shoe injuries were reported to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, an agency spokesman said last week. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons this week will issue new safety advice that recommends helmets, wrist protectors and knee and elbow pads for kids who wear wheeled shoes. &#8220;As these shoes are sold in department stores, parents buying them may develop a false sense of security &#8212; that they are like any other shoe,&#8221; said James Beaty, the academy&#8217;s president and a pediatric orthopedic surgeon in Memphis, Tenn. Heelys and their knockoffs look like gym shoes, but with wheel sockets in each heel. They can be used for walking, but the wheels pop out when users shift their weight to their heels. Balancing on the wheels can be tricky, especially for novices. In the Irish study, most injuries were in new users and occurred when the kids fell backward while trying to transfer their body weight. Leon Benson of Evanston Northwestern Healthcare in Evanston, Ill., recalled treating a 9-year-old girl who&#8217;d had her Heelys for just a week when she fell and broke both wrists. Noah Woelfel of Davidsonville, Md., wasn&#8217;t a novice but still tripped and fell, breaking several fingers and wrist bones in his right hand last year. &#8220;All it took was a tiny piece of gravel in the driveway that went up in the wheel and stopped him cold,&#8221; said the 9-year-old boy&#8217;s mother, Nancy Woelfel. &#8220;He required surgery and pins, and he was six weeks without using his hand, right at the beginning of school.&#8221; Nancy Woelfel threw the removable wheels away. In April, Heelys Inc. said that a study it commissioned showed that the wheeled shoes had a safer injury rate than skateboarding, inline skating and swimming.

The trial found the biotechnology drug Nexavar, by German drugmaker Bayer AG and its U.S. partner Onyx Pharmaceuticals , extended survival by 10.7 months, compared with 7.9 months for those on a placebo -- a 44 percent survival benefit -- sending Onyx shares about 10 percent higher in pre-market trading. "Of about 100 trials in liver cancer in 30 years, all have been negative. There is an unmet need," said Joseph Llovet, director of liver cancer research at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, who led the trial. Liver cancer kills 622,000 people globally each year and is treated with a mix of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. But there are no effective treatments when these aggressive options fail, and Bayer and Onyx hope to be first to fill that treatment gap. Because of the survival advantage, the 600-person study was halted early so that all patients taking part could receive the drug, taken in pill form. The result led Bear Stearns to raise its rating on Onyx shares to "outperform" from "peer perform," according to theflyonthewall.com. The liver cancer data on Nexavar, among a new wave of treatments targeting cell receptors to block cancer growth, were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in Chicago, where tens of thousands of cancer experts are gathering. Although relatively uncommon in the United States, liver cancer is the third biggest cause of cancer deaths worldwide, largely due to the high incidence of hepatitis abroad that can lead to liver cancer, according to the World Health Organization. Nexavar, known generically as sorafenib, is being tested against several types of cancer. Bayer plans to submit its full applications seeking approval to sell the drug for liver cancer with U.S. and European regulators this summer, according to a spokesman. The data presented at this meeting will likely lead to increased off-label use of the drug for liver cancer by doctors even before it is approved for that indication. The companies however cannot promote the medicine for that use until it gains official regulatory approval. Liver cancer is primarily caused by exposure to the hepatitis B and C viruses, which can occur through sharing dirty needles, unprotected sex, in childbirth and from blood transfusions. Alcohol and smoking are also risk factors. Once the virus is acquired, it can take several decades to develop into cancer. The disease is spreading at varying rates throughout the world because of the timing of exposure of different populations. For example, in Japan, a public campaign to vaccinate for tuberculosis in the middle of the last century inadvertently spread the virus via unsanitary injection needles, Mount Sinai's Llovet said. Rates in Japan are still high but have leveled off, while in the United States the virus began spreading quickly in the 1970s with increasing use of illicit drugs with hypodermic needles, he said. In the United States, liver cancer kills about 17,000 people annually, but the rate is growing faster than in many other countries. Onyx shares jumped about 10 percent in pre-market electronic trading to $34 from their $30.88 Nasdaq close on Friday. Bayer shares were little changed in Germany.

This remains true even though marriage quality is poorer for depressed individuals. Sociologists Adrienne Frech and Kristi Williams, Ph.D., from Ohio State University in Columbus co-wrote the study. It appears in the June issue of the American Sociological Association's Journal of Health and Social Behavior. âBased on previous research, we hypothesized that people who are depressed would have worse marital quality and would therefore experience fewer benefits from marriage,â Frech said. âBut that is not what we found.â The researchers speculated that marriage may provide a level of companionship that depressed singles typically lack. Frechâs team used data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The study included 3,066 never-married, divorced or widowed individuals under age 55. To identify depressed individuals, researchers used a 12-item test for depression. Respondents were considered depressed if they scored 23 or more points on the test. After a follow-up period of five years, researchers identified people who got married, the quality of their marriages and how their psychological well-being changed. The study excluded participants who married but ended up divorcing before the five-year follow-up. Researchers found that all participants who married within the five-year period scored an average of about 3.5 points lower on the depression test than those who remained single. Of all the depressed participants, those who got married scored an average 7.5 points lower on the mood scale than the people who remained single. The nondepressed experienced a smaller change in their psychological well-being if they got married.Results from the study confirmed that depressed people report less marital happiness and more marital conflict. Nevertheless, being married enhanced their mood. Previous studies suggest that depressed people benefit from stable social support more than the nondepressed. Robin Simon, Ph.D., an associate professor of sociology from Florida State University in Tallahassee, agrees that this is likely. âThe studyâs findings make perfect sense to me. One symptom of depression is loneliness and lack of companionship. I am not surprised that marriage would supply a psychological boost for the previously depressed,â she said. &copy; Copyright by HealthNewsDigest.com Enter your ZIP code to compare the savings and benefits offered by the discount dental plans in your area.

The race raises millions of dollars nationwide for the American Cancer Society. Cancer survivor Rob Becker is filmed by Michael Pietrobon at Saturday's race at Haddon Township High School. Becker is featured in an American Cancer Society national recruitment video. Cancer survivor Rita Ralston of Washington Township holds her granddaughter, Isabelle Nutt, 3, during the survivor's lap Friday at Washington Township High School. Sunday, June 3, 2007 When Rob Becker first attended the American Cancer Society's Relay for Life, just a few months after his doctors declared him cancer-free, he was reluctant to walk with other survivors. "Some of these people have gone through so much," the 43-year-old Cinnaminson High School history teacher said. "I didn't feel I survived anything. I had a couple of surgeries and some treatment." It took the Cherry Hill resident five years to take his place among the survivors at the yearly overnight walk-a-thon. "I did it to celebrate being a cancer survivor for five years," Becker said. "That was five years ago and since then, I've become more and more involved. I started to understand what it means to be a cancer survivor. It means having the willpower to fight the disease and not let the disease take over your life." Now the once-reluctant survivor is taking his message of hope to relay participants nationwide. On Saturday, camera crews followed Becker, who will be featured in a Relay For Life recruitment video, as he walked with about 50 other area survivors around the Haddon Township High School track. The overnight event is a fundraiser where teams of people take turns walking or running laps. The video, which will be distributed to Relay participants and be available on the Web, is being shot at three locations -- each representing one portion of the relay's new slogan, "Celebrate, Remember, Fight Back." Becker's survival story will constitute the celebrate portion of the video. The remember portion of the video will focus on someone who lost his battle with cancer and the fight back portion will focus on a current patient. Those portions will be shot in North Carolina and Massachusetts. "They picked him because he has become increasingly involved as a survivor," said American Cancer Society national spokeswoman Karen Becker, Rob's wife. "He volunteers year-round for the American Cancer Society." Rob Becker was among the roughly 500 participants in this year's event, one of 11 relays in South Jersey and 4,800 nationwide. Last year, the Haddon Township relay raised $46,000 for the American Cancer Society. This year, officials expect to raise $407 million nationwide, Karen Becker said. "We raise that 10 bucks at a time," she added. Relay participants, many of whom camp overnight, raise money all year in preparation for the event. Some sell baked goods and refreshments to raise more. The roughly 20 members of Team Mimi were among them. They signed up for the first time last year to honor Mary "Mimi" Williams of Pennsauken, who had just died of lung cancer. "We wanted to do something to keep her memory alive," said Christine Margenthal of Haddonfield, Mimi's daughter. "We want her to know the fight she went through wasn't in vain." Mimi never got to meet her first grandchild, born four months after she lost her battle with cancer. She'll also never see the child Margenthal is expecting, her first. "They'll know her," Margenthal said. "We keep her memory alive. That's why we're here."

Brainy Insurance Scam Lobotomized A semi-brilliant scheme to fool a health insurance provider by claiming 20 fake brain surgeries has been busted by the federal prosecutors . A group of people scammed Group Health Insurance out of over $300,000 over four years. Most notably, city employee Stanley Canella claimed he, his wife and four sons had nine brain surgeries during that time. The NY Times says it's unclear whether it's the "nine operations" that "piqued the interest of federal investigators" or if it was that "all four members of the family received insurance reimbursements for the same surgery on the same brain." Did the investigators ask neighbors if the family seemed to have especially large bandages around their heads? GHI's investigators were actually the ones to find the odd billing and tell the feds; a GHI spokesperson told the Times, "Weâre glad the United States attorneyâs office was able to make a case." The scam worked this way: One person, who worked at GHI, got his hands on post-operative reports from two patients who had brain surgery, and then used them to accompany dummy claims. Canella is still on lam, for fraud of over $142,000; he and the other participants, who are from Manhattan, Mount Vernon, and Staten Island, will face between 30 and 90 years for mail and health care fraud.

Is Killer Storm Still Taking a Toll? Almost 2 Years Later, Debate Rages Over Whether Katrina Is Still Killing New Orleans coroner Dr. Frank Minyard is seen in this May 29, 2007 file picture in New Orleans. Nearly two years have passed since Hurricane Katrina left behind death and destruction, but many in the medical community here say the storm is still killing. "There is no doubt in my mind that Katrina is still killing our residents," Minyard said. (AP Photo/Bill Haber) By MARY FOSTER Associated Press Writer NEW ORLEANS Jun 2, 2007 (AP) The bodies are no longer being dragged from houses and buildings toppled by Hurricane Katrina, but nearly two years later many in the medical community think the storm is still killing. Storm survivors are dying from the effects of both psychological and physical stress, from the dust and mold still in dwellings to financial problems to fear of crime, health experts and officials say. "There is no doubt in my mind that Katrina is still killing our residents," Orleans Parish coroner Dr. Frank Minyard said this week. "People with pre-existing conditions that are made worse by the stress of living here after the storm. Old people who are just giving up. People who are killing themselves because they feel they can't go on," Minyard said. Some say an in-depth federal analysis is needed, despite a new state report that found no significant increase in deaths in the New Orleans area from January 2006 through June 2006. The state Department of Health and Hospitals is still compiling figures for the last six months of 2006. Dr. Raoult Ratard, the state epidemiologist, said "the only slight increase" in deaths was in the first three months of 2006 in Orleans Parish. But New Orleans medical officials say that jump, from 11.3 per 1,000 deaths to 14.3 per 1,000, a leap of more than 25 percent was anything but slight. Moreover, the report doesn't take into account evacuees who died while away from the city and were returned for burial. "Our death rate was already high, that's huge," said Dr. Kevin Stephens Sr., director of the New Orleans Health Department. Some New Orleans doctors questioned the accuracy of the population figures used to determine the death rate, saying they might have been too high. DHH secretary Dr. Fred Cerise said he was comfortable with the population data, which he said came from the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The city was abandoned after Katrina struck Aug. 29, 2005, and many people did not begin returning until mid-2006. Is Killer Storm Still Taking a Toll?

But retailers and physicians are warning them to walk, not roll. Wheeled footwear has been tied to knee injuries; arm, hand and shoulder fractures; broken limbs; and at least one death. Doctors says Heelys and knockoffs shouldn't be worn without wrist guards, knee pads, helmets and other protective gear. With the press of a button or push of their heels, kids can now whiz down sidewalks and across floors thanks to trendy roller shoes, a popular brand of which are called Heelys. But zipping around on a wheel or two has landed kids in the emergency room. Between September 2005 and December 2006, at least 64 injuries and one death were reported to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission because of the wheeled shoes; millions have been sold since their arrival around 2000. Injuries have included arm, hand and shoulder fractures, broken toes, feet and legs, concussions and knee injuries. "When you look at the severity of the injuries, it should give a parent concern," says agency spokesman Scott Wolfson. "If you're going to pick up the wheeled sneaker product then your next purchase should be a helmet." Injuries to children and the pedestrians they often run into have prompted local retailers such as Party City to ban rolling around in the shoes. At Simon Mall properties, including Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza, they are not banned, but use of the roller feature is prohibited. This week, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons issued new safety guidelines, including helmets, wrist protectors, and elbow and knee pads for kids wearing the roller shoes. Heelys Inc., the maker of Heelys, issued a press release on its Web site saying that a study commissioned by the company showed that using the wheeled footwear is "significantly safer than bicycling, skateboarding, basketball, soccer and even tennis." However, Heelys Inc. says that the shoes should be used with protective gear. The company offers seminars for kids at stores and parks and videos on its Web site. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta orthopaedic surgeon Michael Bush gives some advice to prevent more children from rolling into the ER: Do the wheeled shoes pose a risk because of design or user-error? "It's a combination of the two. It's like wearing roller blades, so you can have a sudden fast fall; it happens fast. People don't realize that you can get hurt from sudden falls because you don't have time to compensate. (It's the difference between a unicycle and a bicycle). The kids have them on, and they wheel down the mall, they are being distracted, and they fall." What types of injuries are most common? "Since your weight is placed behind you, you get a lot of upper extremity fractures because you tend to reach out and try to protect yourself. I treated a kid with a thigh bone fracture that required surgery. When I went home that afternoon, my daughter said that her mother was going to buy her some Heely's. I said 'No way!' " What would make them safer? "The only thing that would really help would be safety equipment such as wrist guards and helmets."

Get a New Job Save & Share Article Next year's planned 10 percent cut in Medicare payments to physicians will limit seniors' access to doctors, according to a survey of 9,000 doctors released Monday by the American Medical Association. "The AMA is deeply concerned by the alarming news that 60 percent of America's physicians will be forced to limit the number of new Medicare patients they will be able to care for next year when Medicare cuts physician payments," AMA Board Chair Dr. Cecil B. Wilson said in a prepared statement. The AMA wants Congress to stop the payment cut and, instead, increase payments by 1.7 percent in 2008 to keep pace with doctors' cost increases. Next year's 10 percent cut would be the first in a series of payment reductions. Over nine years, total cuts will amount to about 40 percent, while the cost of caring for patients will increase by about 20 percent, the AMA said. The survey found that 77 percent of physicians said they'll be forced to limit the number of Medicare patients as a result of the cuts. Seven-Day Glucose Monitoring System Approved A seven-day glucose monitoring system for people with diabetes has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The STS-7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring System (STS-7 System) measures glucose levels every five minutes throughout a seven-day period. This information can be used to track patterns and detect trends in glucose levels that can't be identified by a standard fingerstick test alone, the FDA said. However, even when using the STS-7 System, diabetics must still use a fingerstick test to decide when additional insulin is needed, the agency said.

Will the new flick spur change in the U.S.? He's rumpled, a little coarse, and shoots from the hip. But Michael Moore, the irreverent force behind such politic-bending documentaries as the gun control manifesto and the anti-war anthem , knows how to stir the pot. Just wind him up, and ole Michael will fire away at entrenched political or corporate interests, no matter their size. He even took time during his 2003 Oscar acceptance speech for to deliver a finger-wagging rant against President Bush's Iraqi policies. Little wonder then that the health-care establishment is bracing itself for the release of Moore's next film, the decidedly anti-medical industry . Moore will begin stumping for his film this week, with a June 5 appearance on Oprah Winfrey's show and then late night chats with David Letterman and Jay Leno. The movie, which is scheduled to hit theaters June 29, wowed audiences in Cannes last month, even reducing some to tears during a heartfelt scene in which an infant dies because she can't get medical care. Now, the big test: Can 113 minutes of sharp-edged film help change the U.S. health-care system for the better? Fierce political debates over health-care reform have accomplished virtually nothing in recent years, but Moore is determined to make sure this time is different. "Do you know of anyone who hasn't had a problem with the insurance company, or getting some procedure covered?" he asks. "Anyone who sees this film will understand exactly the mess we're in right now." Moore's answer to the problem? Rip it apart, give the federal government control, creating a single-payer system that takes for-profit insurance companies out of the equation and regulates pharmaceutical companies "like utilities since they're just as important as electricity and water." Moore is hitting the issue at an opportune time. Politicians and public policy experts have put health-care reform in the spotlight in recent weeks, particularly as Democratic candidates push for their party's presidential nomination. Hillary Clinton, John Edwards, and Barack Obama have all proposed radical overhauls of the health-care industry, with the goal of covering more Americans and lowering costs. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger has also laid out a plan for remaking California's health system, in the wake of a similar move by Massachusetts (see BusinessWeek.com, 4/16/07, "Health Care for All? Not Quite" The proposal from Obama (D-Ill.) came on May 29 in a at the University of Iowa, where he outlined a $50 billion-a-year universal health-care plan for all Americans that would increase taxes on the wealthy and require virtually all employers to offer insurance to workers or face tax penalties. He appealed to all Americans to seize the opportunity to make fundamental improvements in the critically important sector of the economy. "We are people of action and innovation, forever pushing the boundaries of what's possible," he said. "Now is the time to push those boundaries once more." There are plenty who are skeptical that health care is headed for substantial reform, despite the efforts of Moore and others. "It won't happen," says Berkeley professor John Ellwood, co-director of the Robert Wood Johnson Scholars in Health Policy Research Program. He cites a recent /CBS poll that states most folks are generally satisfied with their health care. "Too many people like their doctor and the care that they're getting," he says. "There's no groundswell of protest." But many others, including those in the medical community, are hoping Moore will help make a difference. "Anything&mdash;including a film&mdash;that can bring this issue into the public eye is good for the debate," says heart surgeon Dr. William Plested, president of the American Medical Assn. "So, I'm cheering on Michael Moore, even though I haven't seen the film."

The disease, on May 31, killed 10 ducklings and infected 80 others in a total flock of 120 chickens and 650 ducklings raised by a household in the province's Thai Thuy district, the Department of Animal Health under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said, noting that specimens from the affected poultry have been tested positive to bird flu virus strain H5N1. The provincial veterinary bureau has culled all fowls in affected flocks, disinfected affected areas, and established quarantine checkpoints around the areas. Bird flu, starting to strike Vietnam in December 2003, has hit 15 Vietnamese cities and provinces since early May, the department said.

Monday, June 4, 2007 How Important Is The Umbilical Cord Blood? Umbilical cord blood is the blood that is found in the umbilical cord and the placenta. It is extracted immediately after the delivery of the baby. This blood is rich in stem cells. Stem cells are the architects of your body. They have the capability of creating new blood cells, brain cells, etc. They can adjust to the body anytime and start repairing or replenishing the old cells. can give the scientist a treasure of information about various diseases and birth defects. With a detailed study, the reasons behind various genetic diseases and deformities can be unearthed. The specialty of the stem cells lies in their ability to multiple several times and creates whichever cell the body needs. Diseases That Can Be Treated With Stem Cells More than 70 diseases can be treated with the help of the umbilical cord blood cells. Some of them are as follows: Bone Marrow Failure Disorders like Aplastic Anemia (Severe), Congenital Dyserythropoietic Anemia, Pure Red Cell Aplasia, etc Hemoblobinopathies like Beta Thalassemia Major and Sickle Cell Disease Histiocytic Disorders like Hemophagocytosis Inherited Immune System Disorders like Bare Lymphocyte Syndrome, Reticular Dysgenesis, Chronic Granulomatous Disease, Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome, etc Inherited Metabolic Disorders like Gaucher Disease, Krabbe Disease, Maroteaux-Lamy Syndrome, Tay Sachs, Wolman Disease, etc Leukemias and Lymphomas like Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia, Adult T Cell Leukemia, Hodgkin's Lymphoma, Juvenile Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia, Polymphocytic Leukemia, Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia etc Plasma Cell Disorders like Plasma Cell Leukemia, Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia, etc Other Inherited Disorders like Cartilage-Hair Hypoplasia, DiGeorge Syndrome, Osteopetrosis, etc Extensive research is being conducted the benefits of cord blood stem cells in ailments like Brain tumor, Ovarian cancer, Small cell lung cancer, testicular cancer, Rheumatoid Arthritis, spinal injury, diabetes, Parkinsons disease, Muscular Dystrophy, etc Cord Blood Vs Bone Marrow Transplants Why do we need to preserve the cord blood? Bone marrow stem cells should be enough. Well, there are still debates on this issue. There is one point that everyone agrees with. That is, umbilical cord blood has more stem cells than the bone marrow does. On the other hand, unlike the cord blood, adult donor blood is not limited by quantity. However, cord blood stem cells are more flexible compared to the bone marrow cells. Very rarely is it seen that a patients body has rejected the cord blood stem cells. Cord blood banking is increasing in popularity over the past few years. Two types of banks specialize in umbilical cord blood collection and preservation- Public Cord Blood Bank and the Private Cord Blood Bank. Public Cord Blood Banking services are free. Here you can preserve your childs stem cells. However, a point to note is if you plan to preserve the blood specifically for your family, you will be unable to do so in a public cord blood bank. Here it is more like a donation for the well-being of the society and research. Private blood banks are expensive. Nevertheless, here you can preserve the stem cells just for your family use. is very important because the stem cells of cord blood can be used for treatment of many deadly diseases. It is therefore important to in a cord blood bank also known as cord blood registry. provides answers to all questions that you could have about cord blood banking.

In response to an FDA notice saying toothpaste made in China may contain a poisonous chemical, the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ) said in a statement that it is safe to consume the chemical in question in small quantities. "Our research shows that toothpaste containing up to 15.6 percent diethylene glycol, the chemical that the US side is concerned about, is safe, even after prolonged use," the statement said. The US started checking Chinese toothpaste imports on May 23 as media reports that the products may contain diethylene glycol, a solvent sometimes used as a substitute for glycerin, a sweetener used in drugs. After finding Chinese toothpaste containing 3-4 percent diethylene glycol, the FDA on Friday issued a warning about toothpaste made in China. However, experts from the Chinese Health Ministry said that diethylene glycol is a "low-level" poison that does not accumulate in the body, and said there is no evidence that it can cause cancer or deformities. The AQSIQ also said that a list of the ingredients in the toothpaste exported to the US had been offered to the FDA. The list included diethylene glycol. Also, the toothpaste's labeling had already been registered with the FDA, meaning it could be sold in the US. "Therefore, the FDA warning is unscientific, irresponsible and contradictory," the AQSIQ said. "We've lodged a representation to the FDA and asked it to clarify the facts in a scientific manner as soon as possible." Joseph Famulare, an official with the FDA's center for drug evaluation and research, who was in Beijing attending a workshop this weekend, told China Daily that the US laws ban diethylene glycol as an ingredient in toothpaste. He said recent safety scandals highlighted the importance of being aware of all the ingredients and intermediates in products. To improve the quality of management and the regulatory framework for drug manufacturing, he said the FDA and Peking University had jointly launched a new graduate program on pharmaceutical engineering management.

Now we can enjoy the outdoors: playing, swimming, having picnics. While you are planning summer activities, take a minute to plan for protection against the sun. The Skin Cancer Foundation tells us that skin cancer rates in the United States are increasing at epidemic levels. There is good news, however. Parents can teach their children early sun protection techniques that will help prevent skin cancer later in life. The following recommendations are offered as methods of protection for different age groups. The skin of babies is extremely sensitive and can burn easily. Babies under 6 months old should simply not be in the sun, period. Keep them out of the sun and shaded at all times. For babies over 6 months, follow these tips: ¸ Take walks early in the morning or late afternoon. Use a stroller with a sun-protective cover. Dress babies in loose-fitting clothes. Choose light colors. You can buy clothing made with a UPF of 30 or higher. Check the Internet for pertinent sites. One such site, recommended by the Skin Cancer Foundation, is . A portion of proceeds go to the Skin Cancer Foundation. Protect the babies face, neck, and ears with a hat. If they start wearing a hat in early months the child will get used to it. To protect your baby's eyes, since they can't wear sunglasses, look for the shade between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Apply a broad-spectrum, SPF 15+ sunscreen to areas left uncovered such as baby's hands. In the car, you will need to use a UV-blocking window film. Active toddlers require a little more thought to keep them protected. You will need to leave instructions for caregivers, also. Arrange for your child to play in the shade. A broad-spectrum SPF 15+ sunscreen should be applied every morning, 20 minutes before leaving the house. Keep sunscreen in the bathroom where children brush their teeth, and they will begin to associate applying it with their daily routine. Sunscreens should have both UVA and UVB screens. UVA screens keep the sun from burning the skin, but does not protect the lower layers under the skin. Lotions with UVB screens will protect from UVB rays, which are chiefly responsible for burns. Two tablespoons of sunscreen must be applied every two hours and more often if your child is swimming or sweating. Perspiration washes off the Children should wear sun protective clothing, including shirts, hats and sunglasses. During prolonged exposures, they should wear wide-brimmed hats, long-sleeved shirts and pants. Most of the protection methods used for toddlers and young children should be applied to elementary school children. Teach your children the shadow rule: When outside, if your shadow is shorter than you are, then the sun is high in the sky and the UV rays are intense. Dress children appropriately. Tightly woven fabric that you can't see through easily offers the best sun protection. Oversized T-shirts are OK. Avoid skimpy clothes and sleeveless T-shirts that leave the most vulnerable areas, like the shoulders, exposed. The ears, shoulders, and backs of the neck are most often burned while children are playing. A wide-brimmed hat is a useful protective clothing item that should be worn during recess. Eyes can also be damaged by exposure to the sun. They can be protected by sunglasses with UV (ultra violet) coating. Teach your child to look for the shaded areas in which to play.

The young child had been walking normally when he suddenly shot across the lobby of the YMCA. They struck me as a disaster waiting to happen, even though the company says you shouldn't "heel" faster than you can walk. But if that's the case, what's the point of using them? So far, they've been banned by some shopping malls, schools and amusement parks and were considered one of the 10 worst toys for kids last year by the World Against Toys Causing Harm (W.A.T.C.H.) in Pediatrics shows that the shoes are particularly dangerous for beginners and girls. Last summer, the orthopedic department of a Dublin hospital saw 67 childrenâ56 girls and 11 boys-- for injuries suffered while using "roller shoes" known by the brand names Heelys and Street Gliders. Fractured and dislocated arms, wrists and shoulders were the most common injuries in the children, who ranged in age from 6.2 to 14.9 years. More than half of the injuries occurred in beginners and none of the children had been using protective gear when injured. The authors weren't sure why more girls were injured and speculated that perhaps more girls wear Heelys. Most said they would continue "heeling" or "street gliding" after their injuries healed. One of the problems with the shoes is that they're a cross between sneakers and recreational equipment, said Steven Krug, head of the Division of Emergency Medicine at Childrenâs Memorial Hospital. "Most people buy them as footware and donât assume the necessary precautions," said Krug. "Theyâre not quite roller skates and not a bicycle, but the same sort of problems can occur. Iâve taken care of kids who see a nice little ramp and engage in Heely mode. Maybe you make it, maybe you donât." It's also hard to get kids to wear protective gear when they're walking and suddenly decide to glide twenty feet. Most aren't going to strap on a helmet and wrist pads every time they want to spontaneously roll. The Heelys company says the product is safer than biking, skateboarding, basketball, soccer and even tennis. But the other sports have more children participating. And is Heeling even a sport? Regardless, if you have a beginning "heeler" or you want to try them yourself to catch the bus or break twenty minutes in a five-kilometer race, here are a few roller shoe tips from Heelys: Heelys recommends protective gear when the wheels are in the shoes and coincedentally sells a helmet and protective pads for ($19.99) Always stagger your feet with your strong foot in front â putting them side by side will result in your feet sliding out from under you. When walking with the wheels in, do not lean back on your heels and make sure to walk with your toes touching the ground first. Be extra cautious when heeling on uneven surface â debris and crevices can cause sudden stops and uncontrolled movements. When you feel like you are losing balance, step out of heeling by putting your toes down and lean forward. Good gravy, are we going to get rid of all risk of injury to kids and watch them continue to balloon into fat gobs of teenage goo because we won't let them do anything? I'm 42 and had my share of childhood bumps and bruises. I'm determined to have my kids grow up and not be overly protected from the owies of life. Let's see who handles life better when they are in their 30's; my kids who understand that life hurts sometimes or the ones who have never experienced anything negative before in their lives. Posted by: Kevin Raz | Jun 4, 2007 8:23:29 AM That is really, really ignorant. Worst toys? Most dangerous toys? Come on. Let's see - if you don't work with your child and help him or her learn how to use a new toy, and don't teach him or her to exercise control when using it they can get hurt. Wow. What a surprise.No, the point of heeling is not so you can go faster than you can walk. It's that it's more fun than walking. So what's the difference between Heelys and a bike? The difference is that Heelys are easier for kids to learn to use on their own, so as a result, parents don't supervise the learning as closely, or monitor the use of the toy until kids become more proficient with it, and as a result, kids don't learn to respect or use the toy properly. I'll tell you a counter example. My daughter is overweight. Getting her to exercise was difficult. She has had Heelys since Christmas. Now she loves to exercise. Where before she would go to the kids' area at the grocery store, now she hits the aisles with Mom. She loves to go to the mall now, or anywhere else where there is a big expanse of smooth floor so she can heel. We worked with her from the beginning on heeling responsibly and under control. She doesn't race. She doesn't do stunts. She's not allowed to.Are helmets a good idea? I suppose for some kids they are. More involved parents are a better idea. Posted by: Oh Please | Jun 4, 2007 9:16:57 AM Growing up, I lived on roller skates. In the 70's and 80's we didn't were helmets or protective gear. While it is not exactly the same thing. I didn't skate in stores, or in my house. I have to admit I find them annoying. I do not think they sold be sold as regular shoes. Posted by: Samantha | Jun 4, 2007 9:17:19 AM many times at the jewel see kids zooming around, no parent in site - major accident wanting to happen. Posted by: mary | Jun 4, 2007 9:51:58 AM I hope they ban these stupid things every where I go publicly. Kids today have absolutely no consideration, and expect everyone to get out of their way. I hate when these kids run into me or my fellow adult consumers in the grocery stores. I don't think they are any more dangerous than roller skates, but please keep tabs on your children if they are using them in places they shouldn't. Posted by: Annoyed | Jun 4, 2007 9:53:39 AM It's all well and good to say that Heely's are good excercise for today's overweight, diabetic-prone kids, but do they belong on regular shoes so that kids are skating alongside unassuming, non-heely kids and adults? My toddler has almost been runover by older kids in heely's and it drives me crazy! Do we allow kids to skateboard in grocery stores? Of course not, and there's a reason -- It's dangerous to them and to others. With heely's there is no warning that suddenly a kid will come zooming by you. If you want your kids to rollerskate or rollerblade, get them rollerskates/blades and teach them to use them in public spaces where people might expect it (sidewalks, bike paths etc). Posted by: GFR | Jun 4, 2007 10:00:07 AM Holy guacamole! There is a time and a place to roller skate - in a roller rink, on the sidewalk or on a paved bike path - but NOT IN A MALL! I'm 51 and roller skate (not blade) on bike paths but never in a mall. What right does someone have to do something dangerous in a mall? They will be the first to sue the mall when they get injured or hurt someone else. Safety first - exercise second. Posted by: kathy | Jun 4, 2007 10:19:35 AM How , may I ask, is "heeling" better than "walking" when it comes to exercise? Correct me if I am wrong, but surely walking briskly to get to where you want to be wins hands down. This, as in any other child behavior, definitely needs adult supervision. Posted by: RN | Jun 4, 2007 10:21:35 AM We have a HUGE population of kids in my neighborhood wearing these shoes. I've seen kids trip over cracks in the sidewalk, I've seen them "heel" around gymnasiums and slip and fall. I have seen a few where the wheels come out on accident, and I've also seen them suddenly stop without warning and stumble. I agree that there is a danger. Posted by: LG | Jun 4, 2007 10:35:01 AM It comes down to parenting issues. If kids are not taught to use their active toys properly, they are much more likely to hurt themselves. If kids are not taught manners, and consideration for others, then they are unlikely to behave properly in malls or on public sidewalks. But then, Americans are renowned for behaving like trailer trash moving upmarket, and reaching their kids nothing about proper social behavior. In America, kids raise themselves. Police and teachers have replaced parents in the disciplinary (and even supporting) parenting roles. So maybe it is time to raise adult consciousness to the dreadful adult ethics and parenting in America, and hope that this reflects in better educated, damage-resistant, and more courteous kids. Posted by: Richard | Jun 4, 2007 10:46:51 AM Kevin, did you get all your bumps and bruises while roller skating in the middle of a mall or grocery store? Did your school let you ride your skateboard down the hallway? I see a big difference between banning these things in locations where their use is completely inappropriate and being overprotective. Posted by: Vaughan Johnson | Jun 4, 2007 10:48:17 AM Nice try with the attitude that we're trying to take away excercise from poor overweight children in need of getting out of the house. Get real! They are getting less excercise on these stupid death-trap-wanna-be-shoes than if they wore good ol' sneakers. Instead of walking and using their muscles they are rolling around, coasting and yes, very rudely running people over in malls, stores and sidewalks. Wanna roll around, do it on rollerblades or skates and go to the bike path. I'm fed up with kids rolling around stores with no regard to those around them. Posted by: Fed up | Jun 4, 2007 10:53:45 AM I can't stand the things, mainly because I see kids skating around like they're the only people in the world, and the parents don't do a thing about it. Example: working at a Best Buy, I would see kids skating up and down the tile isle that circled the store. People would come walking out of the isle and the kid, not expecting to see somebody, would run into them. When the parents were tracked down and instructed to control their children, the parents would go off on the manager instead of their child. It's just another example of parents not being responsible. Posted by: Peter Smith | Jun 4, 2007 10:55:46 AM I think it's these parents that feel they have intitlement to let their demon spawn roll around like trained monkeys instead of teaching them there is a proper time and place for everything. It will be Buffy and Trevor sueing the store when little Lucifer rams into a little old lady and breaks her hip while little Lucifer scuffs his knees at the local quickie mart. Posted by: Jasper | Jun 4, 2007 11:10:58 AM These shoes need to be banned. When the kids outgrow these and move on to real shoes you can tell by how poorly they walk. Proper walking is heel to toe. These kids spend so much time in the shoes, all they know is toe. These shoes were the worst invention ever. You are a horrible parent if you buy these shoes for your kid. Let's not even deal with the fact that we are providing our children with a mode of transportation that requires less energy than walking. I hope your kid enjoys his Happy Meal with fattening soda why expending very little energy in his/her heelys. Posted by: Doug | Jun 4, 2007 11:11:21 AM Why can't 'they' just come up with a all-purpose cushioned bubble that will keep everyone safe from falls, insect bites, bad weather, loss of ozone, bad b.o., etc. Only then will our society truly be elevated up among the great societies of ancient Greece and Rome. I'm just glad that we have caring groups in this country that want only the best for my children so that I don't have to bother using good ol' logic/common sense when it comes to raising them. Posted by: kurt | Jun 4, 2007 11:15:14 AM I wonder how all these supporters of heelys would appreciate an adult haphazardly skating through the store. I am pondering doing my grocery shopping on skates since they do not stop these kids. I could get it done in half the time and it certainly would make it much more enjoyable for me. Who cares about all the people I force out of my way and how many in store displays I knock over in the process. Or maybe I should allow my children to ride their bikes in the store when it is raining outside so they can continue to get their exercise. If we are going to allow heelys everywhere to promote physical fitness in our youth then be prepared for bikes, skateboards, regualr skates, roller blades and the razor scooters. It all comes down to parents not being able to tell their darling angels no. A simple no, you can't take your wheels out in the store is too much to ask for. Has anyone heard of any other studies on the long term orthopedic prognosis from extended heely use? It seems to be a very unnatural placement of the foot and some kids spend quite a bit of time in heely mode. Posted by: kwwolf | Jun 4, 2007 11:17:51 AM What about the kids who are taught correctly and are respectful? You have plenty control in Heely's if you use them correctly. I hate this overprotective conservative BS. I love to see the joy of controlled heely kids, and I reprimand those that aren't controlled. Have a little responsibility! Posted by: Nicholas | Jun 4, 2007 11:18:37 AM I have to say, I find these things to be beyond the point of annoying. I work at a grocery store and these kids have no concern for the other shoppers or for the things they are running into. We had one kid that came within inches of hitting a wine display and knocking it over, which inevitably, that situation would have ended with that kid getting cut up very badly and being very hurt. Another child ran into an elderly woman. I have not seen one child supervised by an adult. I find no good in these ridiculous shoes. Go skate in a skating ring or on the sidewalk, not down my cereal aisle. Its not that hard to walk. Posted by: Stephanie | Jun 4, 2007 11:22:14 AM What ever happened to letting kids be kids? Why is every kid over protected?? Parents should be parents...there's no excuse for a kid using these things out in a mall or in similar public places, but I have scarred knees and elbows from when I was a kid - mom kept a bottle of bactene and a box of band-aids in the kitchen for those frequent occasions. Kids are going to fall, they're going to get bruises, broken arms, cuts...it's all part of growing up. It happens. And Lincoln Park moms, it's not the nanny's fault your kid is a big wimp...its yours. Posted by: Marc | Jun 4, 2007 11:29:13 AM I think these things are the greatest idea ever. Yes, I'm a responsible adult with a PhD and a full time job, but I havn't forgotten how to have fun! When I see kids wearing these in airports I thin, "Genius! Why don't they make these in adult sizes?!" Y'all need to lighten up. And I agree with Kevin Raz, who thinks we need to stop being so overprotective of kids. Posted by: Stephanie | Jun 4, 2007 11:29:53 AM Wow, there's lots of people spooked by these shoes. I'm 37, and have been heeling for the last 4 years. It's phenomenal in airports when you've only got a few minutes to try to make a connecting flight. And most parking lots as well. Granted that it takes some patience while you're learning to "get the hang of it", but after becoming proficient I find it to be an excellent timesaver. Don't be fooled with how simple it looks, it ends up being moderate exercise. You can really only go maybe 50% faster than walking on most sidewalks due to all the cracks. In Wal-Mart or Costco where there's a nice surface you can get up to about twice walking speed in an 100% safe manner. I walk 100% in the busy sections at the front of the store or aisle intersections, and heel in the empty aisles to make my way to the back of the store. (Seems like everything you really want is always in the back of the store, right?) It really is 100% safe. I've never run into anyone. The #1 question I get asked when I'm heeling: "wow, where did you find a pair in your size?" They're available on eBay or at Mervyn's and Big 5 sports. Remember that there's a significant learning curve involved here, and you'll build up ankle muscles you never knew you had. But after you're practiced up, it's an excellent way to get around. For all those naysayers: with something that's currently this popular with the youth, and has the potential to make the everyday commute easier, there's a good possiblity that it won't die out like the hoola-hoop. I expect that in another decade these heely-proficient youth will still use the shoes to get around. I recommend going out and trying it for yourself to see what all the fuss is about before you blindly try to get the shoes blacklisted. Posted by: Lorin Thwaits | Jun 4, 2007 11:37:09 AM Jeez enough with overprotecting kids. Everything can be dangerous; the tub, eating, walking out your front door on a blustery day, walking on an icy sidewalk. I look back at some of the dumb things I did as a kid, playing on the roof, jumping bikes off of ramps or into the river. Skeeched in the winter behind buses on icy roads. I've lived and have stories to tell. No helmet or knee pads. Had my brusies and bumps, broke my nose a few times. That's part of being a kid. Parents, educate your kids on consequences and then they're on their own. Cross your fingers and things will turn out ok. The elementary school by my home actually has a sign on the playground that says, "No Running". Can you believe it? The school got tired of being sued by parents when their kids got boo-boos. Enough already. Posted by: BillS | Jun 4, 2007 11:43:19 AM "She doesn't race. She doesn't do stunts. She's not allowed to." Yeah, keep telling yourself that. Posted by: Jack Armstrong | Jun 4, 2007 12:06:53 PM Working in retail, these things are the bane of all employees and patrons in normal footwear--especially the manager, who will most likely have to deal with the repercussions when little Jimmy collides with a table of oh, say, ceramic vases. Kids just shoot through aisles with no regard for their safety or that of anyone else. I'm all for children having fun...at home or a park while properly outfitted in safey gear if necessary. Posted by: Jess | Jun 4, 2007 12:17:24 PM To "Oh Please", Heeling in a grocery store is no more exercise than riding a Razr scooter, and less exercise than walking. In response to the other posters, these shoes are an accident waiting to happen, no question about it. The problem here isn't so much an issue of the kid's health, since most healthy kids can withstand a few bumps & bruises, or even a torn ACL. The real issue is what happens when a child does not pay attention to their surroundings and runs into a 75 year old lady at the mall or the local Jewel. While kids usually recover quickly from injuries, broken hips don't heal quickly at 75 - serious musculoskeletal injuries at that age are often the catalyst resulting in a downward spiral of health that ends in the senior's death. I'm not saying we should make heelies illegal or anything, but kids often have difficulty distinguishing between when it's time to play, and when play is inappropriate. This product blurs those lines significantly, potentially endangering the health of the child and those around them. When I was a kid, we walked places or we bicycled, we didn't roller skate in malls, we didn't have cell phones, and we didn't need to be entertained 100% of the time, even when grocery shopping. It's time some of you parents take authority in your household and spend more effort being a role-model rather than trying to buy them happiness with roller-shoes and other toys (and that's EXACTLY what these are - when I was a kid, you didn't play with toys in the dadgum grocery store unless you wanted a swift swat in the fanny....and somehow my fragile self-image wasn't wrecked like the pop-psychologists want us to believe it would be). Teaching children discipline may not be fun, but it will serve them a lot better in life than a pair of shoes with wheels on them. Posted by: HL | Jun 4, 2007 12:20:29 PM I'm actually a little bit jealous when I see Wheelies...Do they make them for adults? Posted by: Dave Saunders | Jun 4, 2007 12:21:27 PM How many injuries occured to people when these kids plow into them? I am not aginst children playing with these, I am against the parents who refuse to give them boundries. Posted by: BD | Jun 4, 2007 12:29:35 PM What a lot of commentors here seem to fail to grasp is its not the shoes that are the problem, its that the parents feel it ok to have their kids use these in grocery stores, malls, restaurants, airports, etc. I spent a better portion of my 20s on rollerblades along the lakeshore and Lincoln Park. I stayed off crowded sidewalks and always had a pair of sandels with me if I planned on going in a store. Zooming about on wheels in these places is dangerous to others and puts undo wear on the floors. As for the Lincoln Park "nanny" comment, I sense jealousy. I live in Lincoln Park with my family. My wife stays home to raise our daughter. She's 4-1/2, and while I have her on a scooter, skis and training wheels off the bike, I will not allow her to buy heelies. Posted by: Troy | Jun 4, 2007 12:46:24 PM You know as soon as there is a serious accident and/or injury, the shoemaker, the place where the accident occurred and everyone else under the sun EXCEPT the parents, will be held responsible. I was at a Subway the other day, and a family came in and one of the kids had on these shoes, rolled himself through the line, tried to turn and took out the chip stand while falling down on his butt. Few faces turned or paid any attention. The kid got right back up and continued rolling around as if nothing had happened. Didn't even bother to fix the chip rack. Ten bucks says if he had hit his head, Subway would've gotten sued. Posted by: econwriter5 | Jun 4, 2007 12:59:57 PM For the folks who think this is an overprotection issue, I'm much more concerned about individual's rights not to be run into than I am about kids who are not careful or controlled by their parents fracturing their bones. In nature, it's called thinning the herd. I just hope the lawsuits that result when Mr. and Mrs. Bonehead sue the retailers when their little ones sail through a display case don't raise the prices of goods and services. Try a playground. Posted by: John Franklin | Jun 4, 2007 1:08:57 PM I see no difference between "heelies" and roller blades. Kids should not be allowed to use them in grocery stores, shopping malls, on sidewalks, or anywhere else they could cause an accident. It's just common sense. Posted by: J.B. | Jun 4, 2007 1:20:35 PM I think they should be banned from public places. These shoes create hazards not only for kids, but for the adults who have to dodge the children zipping past them. And woe to the folks without fast reflexes or good balance - how many elderly people will have to fall and break a hip before parents realize that their kids' fun needs to be contained in a place where they don't pose a danger to others. Bravo to the stores who have already banned these shoes and actively enforce the ban. Posted by: Anne | Jun 4, 2007 1:22:32 PM As usual, some device is taking the blame for poor parenting. Short of wrapping the youngsters in bubble wrap, there will always be falls, scraps, bruises and the like. Wheelies don't seem to pose an inherent danger (like a certain magnetic toy recently written about in this newspaper). So why don't we give those parenting skills a try. Posted by: Eric | Jun 4, 2007 1:23:37 PM Whoa! Doug, you sure are being judgmental to say "You are a horrible parent if you buy these shoes for your kid." My son has Heelys (he is on his second pair, actually) and I think that I am a pretty good parent. He has never knocked down any display, ran into anyone/anything, broken any bones or otherwise suffered or caused any mishap. Yes, he has fallen down, but he has also fallen off of his bicycle and has tripped and fell while walking with regular shoes. As with most other subjects, not all cases can be lumped into one big case. A universal ban on the shoes is not the answer either. Posted by: Nancy | Jun 4, 2007 1:32:33 PM Am I overprotective? No. Do these wheelie things annoy me? Yes X million. Posted by: Lisa M | Jun 4, 2007 1:40:30 PM It appears from the picture of these shoes on the W.A.T.C.H. site that they only have one wheel in the heel of each shoe. How could a child possibly control their motion & direction while trying to balance on one wheel. There is a reason why most skates have 4 wheels (even the most extreme skates I saw on a site that sells them had 2 wheels & those were designed to be used in the same manner as skateboards). How can anyone safely balance on one wheel? These look like a disaster waiting to happen. Posted by: mwknitter | Jun 4, 2007 1:42:30 PM These shoes are ridiculous. If kids want to roller skate, get them roller skates. No one would allow their kid to roller skate in Target, so why allow the stupid "Heelies?" And as for the "overprotected" comments; I'll bet you guys say the same thing about carseats. Growing up will have its share of bumps and bruises, yes. But it should be the KID getting the bumps and bruises, not the hapless bystanders who happen to be in the kidiot's way. Posted by: pegasus | Jun 4, 2007 1:51:22 PM This reminds me of the brat who wrecked the Buddhist mandala in Kansas City because his mother wasn't paying attention. (The monks were WAY more gracious than I would be!) The problem is not the shoes. It's not even the children. It's the PARENTS! Posted by: Erica | Jun 4, 2007 1:54:51 PM I have to agree with the other posters that the problem is essentially the parents rather than the toy itself. But I won't allow my 3 year old to have these 'shoes' when she's old enough. She does and will continue to wear proper footwear, that is made to support a child's growing foot. When she gets a bike or roller skates they will be the proper equipment made to be safely used for that purpose by children with the correct safety protection. Posted by: Jennifer | Jun 4, 2007 2:29:51 PM I work in a public library, lots of sharp edges, floor with only cement under it and kids are wheeling all over the place. Someone's going to get hurt. It would be my hope that parents would direct their children in the appropriate time and place to use these fun TOYS. They aren't apparel, they're toys.

A new study shows one hospital reported 67 cases of injuries caused by roller shoes last summer vacation. Wrist injuries were the most common. No protective gear was used during the time of these injuries. âTo reduce the rate of such injuries, parents buying roller shoes need to understand both the benefits and risks of this activity,â write researcher Mihai Vioreanu, MRCSI, of Temple Street Childrenâs University Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, and colleagues. âFull protective gear needs to be used at all times, including a helmet, wrist guards, knee pads, and elbow pads when using roller shoes.â Roller shoes are a popular type of sneaker that has a detachable or convertible wheel in the heel, which allows the wearer to lean back and glide on the wheel as well as walk. Theyâre often sold under the brand names âHeelyâ or âStreet Gliders.â The shoes were introduced in 2000 in the U.S., but researchers say little is known about their safety. Roller Shoes Tied to Injury In the study, published in , researchers tracked the number of roller shoe-related injuries at their Dublin hospital during the 2006 summer school holiday. They found 67 children suffered orthopedic injuries while using Heelys or Street Gliders, such as broken bones or dislocated joints. Girls were much more likely to be injured than boys, and the average age of injured children was just under 10. Broken wrists were by far the most common type of injury reported. Other injuries included other broken bones in the arm, elbow dislocation, foot and ankle injuries, and broken bones in the leg. Injuries were most commonly caused by falling backward or forward as the child tried to transfer their body weight and find balance on the wheels. In a few cases, the injury was caused by jumping or a sudden change of direction. Most of the injuries happened while gliding outdoors on a road, sidewalk, cycle lane, or playground. Researchers also found that 20% of the injuries occurred on the first time the child tried to use the roller shoes and 36% occurred while they were learning to use them. They say the results show that close adult supervision is needed during this learning curve and use of protective gear, including wrist guards, is recommended at all times. keep your kids injury-free while they're rollin'?

In the Russian Federation, 64.9% of men smoke daily, a level that is by far the highest in the WHO European Region, where on average 40% of men smoke daily. Although smoking levels among Russian women are much lower (21.6% smoke daily), this figure is the highest among women in the newly independent states (NIS). The NIS comprise Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. The prevalence of smoking among young people is also high, with smoking among boys rising: in a recent WHO study, 27.4% of 15-year-old boys smoked at least weekly (an increase of 3.4% in four years), while 18.5% of 15-year-old girls smoked at least weekly. At a time when tobacco products are becoming more expensive in most countries in the European Region, their price in the Russian Federation fell by over 6% in real terms between 2002 and mid-2005. The Russian Federation has yet to ratify the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, which requires countries to impose comprehensive measures including restrictions on tobacco advertising, sponsorship and promotion, to establish new controls on labelling and indoor air quality, and to strengthen legislation to clamp down on tobacco smuggling. Although smoking is restricted in certain public places in the Russian Federation, including health care, educational and government facilities, workplaces, cinemas and theatres, these restrictions are not as extensive as other countries in the Region. There is no restriction on smoking in bars and restaurants. WHO has been supporting strengthening tobacco control in the Russian Federation in recent years. This has included cooperation and support in the process for the European Strategy for Tobacco Control, the development of a national strategy for non-communicable disease prevention and control, and most recently work through the Bloomberg Global Initiative to Reduce Tobacco Use. The European tobacco control report 2007 provides further information on smoking in the Russian Federation and throughout the European Region. The launch of the Russian version of the report is taking place in St Petersburg, Russian Federation on 31 May 2007. At the end of May, important meetings have been organized in the Russian Federation, such as the All Russian National Forum - Health or Tobacco, in Moscow, and celebrations for World No Tobacco Day in St Petersburg. WHO and other international partners are joining these events and providing their support. Tobacco is the second most important cause of death in the world. It is well known that half the people who smoke regularly today - about 650 million people - will eventually be killed by their habit. Equally alarming is the fact that hundreds of thousands of people who have never smoked die each year from diseases caused by breathing second-hand tobacco smoke. Every year, World No Tobacco Day provides a focus for anti-tobacco advocacy activities. This celebration, on 31 May, informs the public on the dangers of using tobacco, the business practices of tobacco companies, what WHO is doing to fight the tobacco epidemic, and what people around the world can do to claim their right to health and healthy living and to protect future generations. In 2007, the focus is on the dangers of second-hand smoke and everyone's right to enjoy smoke-free environments.

While analysts say the debate may increase the chance of modest reform, it likely will not address the deeper flaws that make the U.S. system more costly but less effective than those of most other industrial countries. The problems confronting the U.S. health care system have only worsened since the early 1990s, when President Bill Clinton and the Democratic-controlled Congress failed to pass a sweeping overhaul. Republicans then won control. "The lesson of the 1990s is that though people are very concerned about these problems, middle income people are risk averse," said Robert Blendon, an expert on health policy at Harvard University. "They want changes but they don't want to be threatened that they're going to lose their doctor, or their system, or their way of getting insurance or their employer's contribution." People who have health insurance have seen double-digit increases each year for much of the past decade. The average annual premium for an employer health plan for a family of four has risen to nearly $11,500, according to the National Coalition on Health Care. The number of people without health insurance has grown to nearly 45 million, Census Bureau figures show. People without insurance spend roughly $125 billion on health care annually, with about a third of that amount -- $40 billion -- going unpaid, a debt largely covered by the government, according to a 2004 Kaiser Family Foundation study. Voters dissatisfied over the high costs regularly list health care as one of the top domestic priorities for the next president. But Blendon, who studies polling on health policy, says candidates have a tricky time guessing what voters mean. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

http://www.themoneytimes.com/articles/20070604/nexavar_prolongs_survival_among_liver_cancer_patients-id-104389.html&cid Nexavar prolongs survival among Liver cancer patients - The Money Times Advertise on this site Tuesday 05th of June 2007 02:49:48 AM - Loans & Credit - Science & Medicine Bollywood News & Gossip Shopping comparison and reviews Nexavar prolongs survival among Liver cancer patients - June 4, 2007 - 0 comments The findings of a clinical trial presented by doctors at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago on Monday provided hope to the deadly liver cancer patients as Nexavar, a drug developed by Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Bayer AG, can now help them extend their lives by almost 3 months or 44% longer than patients given a placebo. The doctors consider this finding as a breakthrough in the field of medicine as this is the first drug that has provided some sort of advancement in the search for a liver cancer cure considering there had been 100 unsuccessful trials of drugs for liver cancer in the last 30 years. But the results would not apply to other forms of liver cancer or to cancers originated elsewhere in the body like lung or breast and then spread to the liver. Liver tumors are generally removed surgically, if possible, or are otherwise subjected to radiation or chemotherapy. The study led by Joseph Llovet, a liver cancer specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, involved 602 patients suffering from the most common form of malignant liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a cancer starting during adulthood in cells in the liver and is also called adult primary liver cancer. Primary liver cancer is different from cancer that has metastasized (spread) from another place in the body to the liver. The signs and symptoms of this cancer may include a hard lump just below the rib cage on the right side (from swelling of the liver), discomfort in the upper abdomen on the right side, pain around the right shoulder blade, or yellowing of the skin (jaundice). âWe did not have anything for these patients,â said Dr. Josep M. Llovet. âNow we have an effective drug that prolongs survival. For the first time, we have a drug that is working.'' said Llovet. The patients under the study were divided randomly and were either given placebos or Nexavar, also called sorafenib, along with the standard therapy. After the study concluded it was noticed that the cancer cells in patients treated with Nexavar spread slowly (28 weeks) as compared to those treated with placebos (12 weeks) and as a result the former subjects lived a median time of 10.7 months compared with 7.9 months for patients on a placebo. Nexavar is taken as an oral pill and is targeted to blocks proteins on cells, to stop tumor cells from proliferating and cut off the blood supply to tumors. Side effects after consuming Nexavar included diarrhea in about 11% of the patients, swelling in hands and feet in another 8%, skin rash and hypertension. The patients suffering with kidney cancer experienced similar side effects. The Californian biotechnology company based in Emeryville, Onyx Pharmaceuticals and German Pharmaceutical company, Bayer have already attained FDAâs approval for the drug as a cure for kidney cancer on December 20, 2005 and are now headed to apply for a regulatory approval to sell it as a drug for liver cancer too that affects the lives of around 17,000 Americans every year. According to Lovet the drug however didnât meet a pre-specified goal for improving the quality of life. It is also expensive and costs around $4,500 a month. Apart from liver cancer it is also being studied in melanoma, lung and breast cancers. Nexavar containing the active ingredient sorafenib is a type of medicine called a multikinase inhibitor which works by interfering in the working and growth of certain cancer cells which grow abnormally due to enzymes called kinases. Liver cancer is associated with Hepatitis B and C infection and is called Hepatic tumor which is growth on or in the liver. This growth can be malignant (cancerous) or benign. Hepatocellular carcinoma is potentially curable by surgery but it only helps a small fraction of people who have localized disease. Laparoscopy may detect metastatic disease, tumor in both lobes of the liver, or an inadequate liver remnant, and avoid the need for open surgery to explore the liver. In some parts of the world, Primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma) is very common but it is still relatively uncommon in the US although it is rising every year due to the increasing incidence of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. People suffering from cirrhosis are more likely to develop adult primary liver cancer. People who have both hepatitis B and hepatitis C may be at a higher risk if they consume more than 3 oz. (80 grams) of alcohol a day. A first-degree relative with hepatocellular carcinoma also increases the risk. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Cheryl and Ted Speaker, Andrew Speaker's parents, and Robert and Betsy Cooksey, the parents of Andrew's new wife, Sarah Cooksey, sat down exclusively with ABC's "Good Morning America" anchor Diane Sawyer to explain their view. Fellow Passenger Rips 'Selfish' TB Patient The TB Debate: Who Was Right? TB Patient's Wife Defends His Travel Timeline of Speaker's TB Odyssey He Said, CDC Said: TB Patient, Health Officials' Stories Differ EXCLUSIVE: TB Patient: 'I Really Believed I Wasn't Putting People at Risk' EXCLUSIVE: TB Patient Speaks Out; Asks Forgiveness Prognosis for TB Traveler: Isolation, Surgery, Uncertainty After TB Scare, Isolation TB Patient Defied Docs to Fly for Wedding Some people have questioned how family members, knowing Andrew had a contagious disease, could allow him to board trans-Atlantic flights. Others have raised questions about Robert Cooksey's connection to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and wonder whether it influenced any decisions. Robert Cooksey is a tuberculosis researcher. "I think the best way to explain it for myself and my family, my friends: 'We're in hell, and we want to get out of hell,'" said Ted Speaker, Andrew's father. Cheryl Speaker said she wanted the world to know she and her family did not believe their acts were reckless. "We are not people of reckless behavior," she said. Everyone went to Greece for the Speaker-Cooksey wedding without any worries about any contagious situations, said Betsy Cooksey, Andrew's mother-in-law. . "And do you think that this man who is an expert in TB, do you think that this man, if he had thought that there was any danger whatsoever to his only child and his only grandchild, that he would've allowed this to happen?" Cheryl Speaker asked about Robert Cooksey, Sarah's father. "We were told that these -- induced sputum [PH] tests that he had had were â¦ were negative to that point. And so, by the guidelines, he was not considered infectious," Robert Cooksey said. Taped Conversation With Health Officials Questions exist about a meeting with local health officials before the trip to Greece. Officials say they told Andrew Speaker he would put others at risk by traveling abroad for the wedding and then returning home on a commercial flight. "We asked him [the official] repeatedly during that meeting, 'Is he contagious?' All times they said, 'No, you're not contagious,'" Ted Speaker said. Other family members agreed that no ambiguity had existed about whether Andrew Speaker could pass the illness along to others. "Then he said of course, 'I prefer you not to travel. I prefer you just say here,'" Ted Speaker said. He said the official never gave a reason why. "Well, are, are you just saying this to cover yourself?" Ted Speaker said he asked the official. "And he said, 'Yes,'" Ted Speaker said. Ted Speaker says he has an audiotape of the conversation with health officials in which they clearly say that his son was not contagious. He plans to release the tape at some point and says he believes it will confirm the family's side of the story. "They said on tape it was not contagious," Ted Speaker said. Ted Speaker said he taped conversations as part of his natural routine, partly because of hearing loss he sustained during his time as a helicopter pilot in Vietnam. Previously, Andrew Speaker indicated that the conversation was taped as a protective measure and that it served as a record. Ted Speaker said he never thought about telling them the conversation was being taped. But, he said in hindsight that he would have alerted them.

The truth about the US healthcare system - Independent Online Edition > Americas Business Analysis & Features A-Z Unis & Colleges from The Independent & The Independent on Sunday Sicko? The truth about the US healthcare system Michael Moore's new film is a damning indictment of the way the world's richest country looks after those who fall ill. Andrew Gumbel finds out whether his accusations are justified Published: 04 June 2007 Cynthia Kline knew exactly what was happening to her when she suffered a heart attack at her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She took the time to call an ambulance, popped some nitroglycerin tablets she had been prescribed in anticipation of just such an emergency, and waited for help to arrive. On paper, everything should have gone fine. Unlike tens of millions of Americans, she had health insurance coverage. The ambulance team arrived promptly. The hospital where she had been receiving treatment for her cardiac problems, a private teaching facility affiliated with the Harvard Medical School, was just a few minutes away. The problem was, the casualty department at the hospital, Mount Auburn, was full to overflowing. And it turned her away. The ambulance took her to another nearby hospital but the treatment she needed, an emergency catheterisation, was not available there. A flurry of phone calls to other medical facilities in the Boston area came up empty. With a few hours, Cynthia Kline was dead. She died in an American city with one of the highest concentration of top-flight medical specialists in the world. And it happened largely because of America's broken health care system - one where 50 million people are entirely without insurance coverage and tens of millions more struggle to have the treatment they need approved. As a result, medical problems go unattended until they reach crisis point. Patients then rush to hospital casualty departments, where by law they cannot be turned away, overwhelming the system entirely. Everyone - doctors and patients, politicians on both the left and the right - agrees this is an insane way to run a health system. When Elizabeth Hilsabeck gave birth to premature twins in Austin, Texas, she encountered another kind of insanity. Again, she was insured -- through her husband, who had a good job in banking. But the twins were born when she was barely six months pregnant, and the boy, Parker, developed cerebral palsy. The doctors recommended physical therapy to build up muscle strength and give the boy a fighting chance of learning to walk, but her managed health provider refused to cover it. The crazy bureaucratic logic was that the policy covered only "rehabilitative" therapy - in other words, teaching a patient a physical skill that has been lost. Since Parker had never walked, the therapy was in essence teaching him a new skill and therefore did not qualify. The Hilsabecks railed, protested, won some small reprieves, but ended up selling their home and moving into a trailer to cover their costs. Elizabeth's husband, Steven, considered taking a new, better-paying job, but chose not to after making careful inquiries about the health insurance coverage. "When is he getting over the cerebral palsy?" a prospective new insurance company representative breezily asked the Hilsabecks. When Elizabeth explained he would never get over it, she was told she was on her own. Everyone in America has a health-care horror story or knows someone who does. Mostly they are stories of grinding bureaucratic frustration, of phone calls and officials letters and problems with their credit rating, or of people ignoring a slowly deteriorating medical condition because they are afraid that an expensive battery of tests will lead to a course of treatment that could quickly become unaffordable. Even when things don't go horribly wrong, it is a matter of surviving by the skin of one's teeth. In Montana, Melissa Anderson can't find affordable insurance because she is self-employed - an increasingly common affliction. When her son Kasey came down with epilepsy two years ago, she was saved only by a recently introduced child health insurance programme specifically tailored to people who aren't poor but can't afford to pay monster medical bills. She herself remains uninsured for anything short of major care needs. Over the past 15 years, the stories have become less about poor people without the economic means to access the system - although that remains a vast, unsolved problem - and more about the kind of people who have every expectation they will be taken care of. Middle-class people, people with jobs that carry health benefits or - as the problem worsens - people with the sorts of jobs that used to carry robust health benefits which are now more rudimentary and risk their being cut off for a variety of reasons. This is the morass that Michael Moore has chosen to explore in his latest documentary, Sicko, which goes on release later this month. Moore spends much of the film demonstrating that there is nothing inevitable or necessary about a system that enriches insurance companies and drug manufacturers but shortchanges absolutely everyone else. His searching documentary looks at health care in France, Britain, Canada, and even Cuba - still regarded as a model system for the Third World. Moore has his share of ghoulishly awful stories. The film kicks off with an uninsured carpenter who has to decide whether to spend $12,000 (&pound;6,000) reattaching his severed ring finger or $60,000 to reattach his severed middle finger. Later on, Moore focuses on a hospital worker whose husband needed a bone marrow transplant to save him from a rare disease. The couple's insurance company refused to cover the transplant because it regarded the treatment as "experimental". The husband died. Many more stories are collected in a newly published book called Sick: The Untold Story of America's Health Care Crisis, by Jonathan Cohn. A woman in California called Nelene Fox died of breast cancer after she, too, was turned down for a bone marrow transplant by her insurance company. In Georgia, a family whose infant son went into cardiac arrest were forced to take him to a hospital 45 miles away on their insurance carrier's orders. He survived, but suffered permanent disabilities that more prompt treatment might have averted. In New York, an infant called Bryan Jones - whose case was trumpeted all over the local media at the time - died of a heart defect that went undetected because his insurance company kicked him and his mother out of hospital 24 hours after his birth, too soon to carry out the tests that might have spotted the problem. America's health system offers a tremendous paradox. In medical technology and in the scientific understanding of disease, it is second-to-none. Since doctors are better paid than anywhere else in the world, the country attracts the best of the best. And yet many, if not most, Americans are unable to reap the advantages of this. In fact, as The New York Times columnist Paul Krugman has argued, the very proliferation of research and high-tech equipment is part of the reason for the imbalance in coverage between the privileged few and the increasingly underserved masses. "[The system] compensates for higher spending on insiders, in party, by consigning more people to outsider status --robbing Peter of basic care in order to pay for Paul's state-of-the-art treatment," Krugman wrote recently. "Thus we have the cruel paradox that medical progress is bad for many Americans' health." Having the system run by for-profit insurance companies turns out to be inefficient and expensive as well as dehumanising. America spends more than twice as much per capita on health care as France, and almost two and a half times as much as Britain. And yet it falls down in almost every key indicator of public health, starting, perhaps, most shockingly, with infant mortality, which is 36 per cent higher than in Britain. A recent survey by the management consulting company McKinsey estimated the excess bureaucratic costs of managing private insurance policies - scouting for business, processing claims, and hiring "denial management specialists" to tell people why their ailment is not covered by their policy - at about $98bn a year. That, on its own, is significantly more than the $77bn McKinsey calculates it would cost to cover every uninsured American. If the government negotiated bulk purchasing rates for drugs, rather than allowing the pharmaceutical companies to set their own extortionate rates, that would save another $66bn. Astonishingly, there hasn't been a serious debate about health care in the United States since Bill Clinton, with considerable input from his wife Hillary, tried and failed to overhaul the system in 1994. That, though, may be about to change as the 2008 presidential race heats up. Everyone acknowledges the system is broken. Everyone recognises that 50 million uninsured - including almost 10 million children - is unacceptable in a civilised society. Even the old, classically American free-market argument - that "socialised" medicine is somehow the first step on a slippery slope towards godless communism - doesn't hold water, because in the absence of a functioning private insurance regime the government ends up picking up about 50 per cent of the overall costs for treatment anyway. The indigent rely on a government programme called Medicaid. The elderly have a government programme called Medicare. And perhaps the most efficient part of the whole system is the Veterans' Administration, a sort of NHS for former servicemen. Rather like London and Paris in the 19th century, where the authorities belatedly paid attention to outbreaks of cholera once the disease started affecting the rich and middle classes, so the American health crisis may be coming to a head because of the kinds of people who are suffering from its injustices. Corporate chief executives, for a start, are gagging under the ever-increasing costs of providing coverage to their employees. Starbucks now spends more on health care than it does on coffee beans. Company health costs, as a whole, are at about the same level as corporate profits. In a globalised world where US businesses are competing with low-wage countries such as India and China, that is rapidly becoming unacceptable. That explains, perhaps, why the chief executive of Wal-Mart, Lee Scott, has made common cause with America's leading service sector union - more commonly a bitter critic of Wal-Mart's labour practices - in calling for a government-run universal health care system by 2012. It's going to be a tough battle. The insurance and pharmaceutical industries bankroll the campaigns of dozens of congressmen and have so far been brutally efficient in protecting their own interests. The Clintons were defeated in 1994 in part because of the power of the industry lobbies. Doing better this time will take singular political courage. In the meantime, we will hear ever more crazy stories like the one told by Marijon Binder, a former nun in Chicago who ended up being sued by a Catholic hospital for $11,000 because her two-night stay for a heart scare was not considered a worthy charity case. Binder, who works as a live-in companion to a disabled old woman, wrote on all her admission forms that she had no insurance and, in her telling at least, was reassured the hospital would take care of her anyway. After a year and a monstrous bureaucratic fight that went nowhere, a civil judge promptly absolved her of responsibility for her bill - a lucky outcome, for sure. Binder said: "The whole experience was very demeaning. It made me feel very guilty; it made me feel like a criminal." She is, though, alive and solvent. Not everyone in this system catches the same break.

The test has his-and-hers components. The two-in-one test helps drive home the message that both men and women can contribute to infertility. The test for the male assesses the ability of sperm to swim through a solution similar to cervical mucus, as well as the number able to do so, said Dr. Keith B. Isaacson, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School who is on the board of medical advisers at Genosis, the maker of the test. Results are available in 80 minutes. The female fertility test is a urine stick that measures the level of follicle-stimulating hormone on the third day of the menstrual cycle. An abnormally high level is an indicator that egg quality is low. The result is available in 30 minutes.

The Risk Communication Advisory Committee will; help FDA better understand the communication needs and priorities of the general public; advise FDA on the development of strategic plans to communicate product risks and benefits; and make recommendations to FDA on what current research suggests about crafting risk and benefit messages, as well as how to most effectively communicate specific product information to vulnerable audiences. &ldquo;Communicating the risks and benefits associated with FDA-regulated products is essential to help consumers and health care professionals make informed decisions,&rdquo; said Randall Lutter, Ph.D., FDA&rsquo;s acting deputy commissioner for policy. &ldquo;The Risk Communication Advisory Committee will bring together a broad range of experts and views to help improve FDA&rsquo;s communication of the science-based information about product risks and benefits that the public needs to make informed decisions.&rdquo; Establishment of the new Risk Communication Advisory Committee stems from the Institute of Medicine&rsquo;s (IOM) 2006 report, The Future of Drug Safety: Promoting and Protecting the Health of the Public. The report recommended that Congress enact legislation establishing a new advisory committee to address how FDA communicates information about the efficacy, safety and use of drugs and other FDA-regulated medical products. FDA agreed with the value of such a committee and acted promptly to establish it through more speedy administrative procedures. FDA also expanded the scope of the committee to cover communication of risks and benefits of all products regulated by the agency. The advisory committee will be made up of 15 voting members that include experts and public members who are not affiliated with the FDA. Experts will include authorities knowledgeable in the fields of risk communication, social marketing, health literacy, cultural competency, journalism, bioethics, and other relevant behavioral and social sciences. Public members will include those who can provide the perspective of users of FDA-regulated products, such as consumers, patients, caregivers and health professionals. Two related Federal Register notices are being published, one announcing the establishment of the new advisory committee and the other requesting nominations for members to serve on the committee. For information: Nominations for advisory committee members received on or before 45 days after the Federal Register publication will be given first consideration for membership.

The female test detects hormone levels and measures egg production. It takes about 30 minutes, and is similar to the FSH test that doctors use. "The FSH test that we do in our office â that's actually in this kit â is the first test we look for when a woman comes for an evaluation," said Dr. Harry Fisch of the Columbia University Medical Center. The male test in the kit measures the concentration of moving sperm, a key indicator of sperm health. Male test results show up within 80 minutes. While doctors said the test is a good first option for couples concerned about fertility, they cautioned that the Fertell Kit may not catch every problem. "This test is not a guarantee that you're fertile or not," Fisch said. "But it's a great start." Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts. Tell us what you know.

The parents of Andrew Speaker and his new wife, Sarah, who all attended the couple's wedding in Greece last month, also asserted that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provided no help that would have allowed Speaker to avoid returning from Europe by a commercial flight. The four appeared in a joint interview with ABC's "Good Morning America." Speaker triggered an international health alert by defying U.S. health officials, flying to and from Europe for his wedding and honeymoon, then driving across the U.S. border in upstate New York while on a watch list for detention. Speaker is now being held under a federal isolation order for treatment for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, or XDR TB, a strain that is resistant to most antibiotics. His father-in-law, Dr. Robert Cooksey, a researcher in the CDC's Division of Tuberculosis, said on Monday Speaker was not contagious under health guidelines. Tests have shown very little tuberculosis bacteria in sputum obtained from Speaker's lungs, which suggests it would be difficult, but not impossible, for him to transmit the disease. "We were told that these induced sputum tests that he had had were negative to that point, and so by the guidelines, he was not considered infectious," Cooksey said. Speaker's father, Ted Speaker, said a tape-recording of a pre-trip meeting with CDC officials confirms the same conclusion. "They said on tape it is not contagious ... at least three times," said the elder Speaker, adding that he plans to release the tape. Speaker's mother, Cheryl Speaker, suggested the family's decision to proceed with the wedding in Greece and a honeymoon in Rome was supported by Cooksey's professional judgment. "Do you think that this man, who is an expert in TB, do you think that this man, if he had thought that there was any danger whatsoever to his only child and his only grandchild, that he would have allowed this to happen?" she said. news is provided by Zoom to full size map Mauritania Islamist suspects were tortured -lawyer Insurgent video shows IDs of missing U.S. soldiers Omega-3 fatty acids reduce blood pressure -study W.Sahara talks set for June 18-19 near New York Bush urged to back UN efforts on climate change InterAction Statement on President's Renewed AIDS Plan Source: InterAction - USA American Red Cross Promotes Prevention and Control of Tuberculosis Along U.S. - Mexican Border Source: American Red Cross - USA Volunteer physicians depart for Afghanistan: Twin surgeons from New York City arrive in Kabul today Source: Medical Teams International - USA Leader of AJWS Grantee Wins Prestigious Human Rights Award Source: AJWS - USA Red Cross volunteers prevent malaria deaths in Niger Source: IFRC - Switzerland Andrew Speaker (2nd L), a 31-year-old attorney, stands next to his bride Sarah Cooksey during their wedding ceremony on the Greek island of Santorini May 18, 2007.

The CDC says on its website that actions of Robert C. Cooksey, a CDC TB expert who has worked for the agency for 32 years, are now under review and health officials want to see if the father-in-law of Speaker played any role in his son-in-law and daughter's travels with a form of tuberculosis which resists almost all antibiotics. On a personal statement published on the CDC's web site, Cooksey has already denied any wrongdoing in the whole drama involving his son-in-law, claiming that Speaker's TB has nothing to do with him or the CDC. He has had no influence on the travel plans of Speaker and his daughter. Speaker has been now under federal quarantine for extensively drug resistant tuberculosis since May 25 a day after he sneaked back to the The personal injury lawyer was placed as the first person in the last 40 plus years under federal quarantine. The CDC says the Denver Health Authority Public Health Department has issued an order to continue detaining him in the National Jewish Medical and until further laboratory tests indicate that he is no longer contagious. He is currently considered infectious based on tests on specimens that were reported culture positive for extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. Accordingly, the federal quarantine order has been lifted; but the CDC says it will continue providing input and consultation to local authorities on the diagnosis, management and methods for preventing of spread of communicable disease. Speaker and his wife Sarah Cooksey flew to last month to get married as planned for a long time. By Mr. Speaker's account, he was told the disease he was suffering was not contagious and it would pose any risk to any other person. The health officials suggested he should not travel, but did not prohibit him from flying. Dr. Steven Katkowsky, director of the ) Department of Health and Wellness, was cited as saying by healthday.com that Speaker had been told in early May not to travel to Results of a test showing Speaker's TB infection is actually XDR-TB became only available when the couple was on the midst of their honey-moon. health officials ordered him to report to health authorities and not to return to the Speaker decided that submission to such an order could result in loss of an opportunity of getting treated in the , which would put him in danger, he thought. where he rented a car and drove back to the "He was told traveling is against medical advice," healthday.com cited Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine as saying. Cetron said once Speaker got in , "He was told in no uncertain terms not to take a flight back." Health officials are now concerned about the passengers who sit near Speaker on two long flights. One flight was Air flight #385/Delta Airlines flight #8517, which departed on May 12 from Passengers included 292 Americans. Another was Czech Air flight #0104, which departed on May 24 from . There were two Americans on board, Speaker and his wife. In a statement posted on Saturday, the CDC says the agency has contacted 160 Americans or their relatives as of June 2, 2007. The CDC says it will continue reaching out for the remaining passengers. So far, the agency has contacted all 26 who were most likely to get infected if Speaker was infectious at all at the time. Of them, six are currently out of the and their relatives and families were contacted. The CDC warns that the information on the extensively drug resistant tuberculosis circulated in news media is not all accurate. The following is provided by the agency to correct the misinformation. Many recent media stories have conveyed information or impressions regarding tuberculosis that are inaccurate, including information about how the disease is transmitted, how quickly people may become infected or show symptoms, and the contagiousness of the disease. There are some other important characteristics of tuberculosis that need to be conveyed: Only a person with active TB disease can spread TB bacteria to others. Persons who have spent prolonged time with someone with active TB disease should get tested for TB infection. It usually takes prolonged exposure to someone with active TB disease for someone to become infected. After exposure, it usually takes 8 to 10 weeks before the TB test would show if someone had become infected. A person with a positive test for TB infection (i.e., latent TB infection) is not sick, and cannot spread TB germs to others. However, some of these persons can go on to develop TB disease, especially if their immune system is weak, for example, HIVinfected persons, persons with diabetes, or persons undergoing treatment for certain forms of cancer. The CDC also provides the following advice for those who may get infected with the XDR TB on those two long flights. What should a person do if they were on the Air flight #385 / Delta flight 8517 on May 12 with the XDR TB patient? They need to go to their doctor or local health department and request a TB evaluation, as well as contact their State TB Control Office. They should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of TB disease, and get a TB skin test or the QuantiFERON®TB Gold blood test (QFT-G) to test for TB infection. It can take 8 to 10 weeks after infection for a persons immune system to react to the TB skin test or QFT-G. It is important to get a TB test as soon as possible because people may already have latent TB infection, but are unaware since there are no signs and symptoms. The first test is needed to determine whether a person already had latent TB infection before this recent exposure. A person with latent TB is not infectious. If a persons first test is negative, they will still need to get a second TB test 8 to 10 weeks following the flight date (i.e., the time of their last possible exposure to the patient) to determine if they may have been infected by the XDR TB patient. If the first test is positive, their doctor or nurse may do other tests to see if treatment is needed.

One 36-year-old man from New York City claimed nine brain surgeries for himself, along with his wife and two sons, receiving reimbursements from New York-based Group Health Incorporated totaling $142,268, federal investigators said Friday. GHI paid out more than $300,000 in reimbursements to all four defendants, based on the claims. Besides the 36-year-old man, an indictment filed in federal court alleges that a 39-year-old man from Mount Vernon, a 42-year-old woman and a 37-year-old man, both from New York City, defrauded the insurance company. Three were in custody and are likely to be arraigned next week. The 36-year-old man remained at large. The indictment alleges that the Mount Vernon man, an employee at a medical billing company, altered claims to the insurance company by swapping the names of people who actually underwent brain surgery with two others charged in the scheme. The fraudulent claims were then sent along with altered postoperative reports to the insurance carrier for reimbursement, the indictment alleges. Ilene Margolin, a spokeswoman for GHI, told The New York Times that her company's own internal investigators first noticed the defendants' unusual claims before turning over its findings to the government.

Ten ducklings died and 80 others fell sick in a farm in Thai Binh province on Thursday, and tests found they had the H5N1 virus, the Animal Health Department said in a report. On Saturday the country had reported its second human case of the virus in less than a month, after a year and a half with no new human cases. Both victims were in hospital in stable condition, officials said. A total of 42 Vietnamese have died since the virus re-surfaced in Asia in late 2003. The infection in ducklings in Thai Binh means the virus has spread to poultry in 14 provinces plus the Mekong delta city of Can Tho since early May. Regarding recent human cases, doctors reported on Saturday to a government meeting on bird flu prevention on two men, from the northern provinces of Vinh Phuc and Thai Nguyen. The first patient, from Vinh Phuc, helped slaughter chickens at a friend's wedding early last month before he developed high fever. The second, a worker in a poultry slaughterhouse outside Hanoi, became sick on May 26. Both were taken to a hospital in Hanoi where their conditions have stabilised.

BRODER As an adviser to Bill and Hillary Clinton, Ken Thorpe had a close-up view of the fiasco that was health care reform in 1993-94. Since that effort crashed, he, like many others, has watched in frustration as costs have soared and health insurance has moved beyond the reach of millions more Americans  46 million in all. But unlike others, the Emory University professor of health policy has a clear strategy for attacking the problem  and he is beginning to enlist influential allies in his cause. It's essentially a flanking attack  shifting the focus from the longtime arguments over financing mechanisms and coverage concerns to an assault on the real cost-driver in the system: chronic diseases. In presentations that have begun to shift the policies of both Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, Thorpe makes a few basic points: Government records show that 75 percent of the health care costs and seven out of every 10 deaths are attributable to chronic diseases such as asthma, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. Obesity, which has doubled in 30 years, is by itself responsible for 30 percent of the increase in health care costs during that period. In far too many cases, perhaps a majority, treatment of these diseases is intermittent and inconsistent. What is worse, little has been done to prevent them or arrest them in early stages. "Once you put those numbers on it, the policy implications are pretty clear," Thorpe said in an interview. "You start with prevention and better management of obesity and high blood pressure  not the contentious issues that have dominated the debate." Thorpe has now been joined by Mark McClellan, who until recently ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs for the Bush administration, as spokesmen for the Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease, a broad-based national coalition ranging from the American Academy of Family Physicians to the NAACP, the Chamber of Commerce and the YMCA. Affiliates in New Hampshire, Iowa and South Carolina will highlight the issue as the presidential candidates move through those early-voting states. Already, many candidates are picking up the message. Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton was using Thorpe's statistics and analysis on May 24 when she delivered the first of a promised series of speeches outlining her new approach to health reform. It emphasizes disease prevention and cost reductions through better case management, rather than immediate expansion of coverage. Those are important elements also in the plans that her rivals Barack Obama and John Edwards have announced. On the Republican side, McClellan's old boss, former Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who has written two books on the importance of healthy diets, are already on board, and other candidates' staffs have been conferring with McClellan. McClellan told me that Republicans "don't want to go to price controls or government regulation, so they understand prevention is the only way to get from here to there," a way to lower costs and improve coverage. To demonstrate that this is not just theoretical talk, Thorpe and McClellan are proselytizing in individual states. Vermont is their earliest test case. There, a Democratic legislature and Republican governor were at loggerheads over health reform; a veto had stopped the Democratic bill from enactment. Thorpe helped break the impasse, and the state has now embarked on a coordinated strategy. A three-year effort to link doctors offices and hospitals into an electronic records-keeping system, facilitating better coordination and management of chronic conditions, is beginning now in six towns and will be expanded to the whole state. Along with that, insurance regulations have been changed to eliminate co-pays for routine diagnostic and preventive measures. At the same time, a public health campaign is under way in schools and workplaces to inculcate healthier lifestyles. Savings from the new program will be used, under the legislation, to subsidize health insurance policies for Vermonters who now lack coverage. The shift of focus to preventive care and management of chronic diseases offers encouragement to those legislators in both parties who are promoting more ambitious schemes to cover the uninsured. By promising reduced costs and better care for the majority of Americans who already have health insurance, this approach perhaps can build support for what still needs to be done to end the shame of America's broken health care system.

Marriage might cheer you up, says study More public holidays please, we're Italian Spanish anthem to get words so sportsmen can sing NEW YORK (Reuters Life!) - If you're feeling blue, marriage could help cheer you up, according to a U.S. study. Researchers from Ohio State University in Columbus found that marriage provides greater psychological benefits to depressed people than to people who are not depressed before they walk down the aisle. This remains true even though marriage quality is poorer for depressed individuals. "Based on previous research, we hypothesized that people who are depressed would have worse marital quality and would therefore experience fewer benefits from marriage but that is not what we found," researcher Adrianne Frech said in a statement. Frech's team, whose report appears in the June issue of the Journal of Health and Social Behaviour, used data from the National Survey of Families and Households to examine 3,066 unmarried people aged 55 years and under. Using a 12-item test for depression, they considered respondents depressed if they scored 23 or more. After a follow-up period of five years, researchers identified people who married during the period, asked about the quality of their marriages and how their psychological well-being had changed. The study excluded participants who married but ended up divorcing in the five years. Researchers found that the participants who married within the five-year period scored an average of about 3.5 points less on the depression test than those who remained single. &copy; Reuters 2007.
