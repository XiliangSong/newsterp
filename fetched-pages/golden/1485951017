http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/us/politics/31thompson.html Stir in G.O.P. as Ex-Senator Moves to Run in G.O.P. as Ex-Senator Moves to Run Ann Johansson for Senator Fred D. Thompson will begin raising money for a campaign for the Republican nomination. May 30 — Former Senator of Tennessee has taken new steps that make it clear that he is likely to run for the White House, potentially shaking up a field of candidates that has failed to strike a chord with the Republican base. His Own Words The latest political news from around the nation. Ann Johansson for Senator Fred Thompson greeted Boy Scouts after speaking in California to the Lincoln Club of Orange County on May 4. Mr. Thompson is creating a committee that will let him begin raising money on Monday toward a full-blown national campaign, advisers said Wednesday. They hope his name recognition as an actor and radio commentator, conservative stands on issues like and government spending, and strength in the South will differentiate him from the current crop of candidates. The disclosure of his intensifying activities sent ripples through the party, with the campaigns of two of the main Republican candidates checking with their deputies in Iowa and New Hampshire to monitor any hiring or fund-raising efforts by Mr. Thompson, 64. One campaign held a brief strategy session to review poll results on Mr. Thompson, and found him well-positioned even as an unannounced candidate. His moves come as have failed to coalesce around a candidate, as they struggle with the war in Iraq, President Bush’s unpopularity and questions about the party’s ideological direction. That has created a potential opening in a campaign field that, judging by polls and other reaction, has left Republican voters wanting more. “Thompson is a credible conservative, he has a strong voting record, he has strong, almost Reagan-esque communication skills,” said Scott Reed, who managed the presidential campaign of the Republican in 1996 and is unaffiliated with any campaigns. “And like Reagan, he believes in an ideological agenda in an undiluted way. He doesn’t have a bunch of qualifiers on things when he defends the Reagan years.” In a conference call on Tuesday, 75 to 100 Republicans who had offered to back the politician better known for his acting career were urged to raise roughly $50,000 each for the financial underpinnings of a Thompson bid that has been in the making for months. Five people closely involved in the emerging campaign discussed the plans in interviews Wednesday but asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk publicly about the details. Participants on the call said Mr. Thompson was enthusiastic about becoming an alternative to current contenders led by former Mayor of New York, Senator of Arizona and former Gov. of Massachusetts. They said he was not ready to formally announce without evidence that he could draw the necessary financial support. “You have to raise money to be competitive even if you are Fred Thompson,” said Representative Zach Wamp, a Tennessee Republican who has led an effort to draft Mr. Thompson. In another development on Wednesday, Mr. Thompson asked to be released from his role on “Law & Order” on NBC, The Associated Press reported. The show’s executive producer, Dick Wolf, said Mr. Thompson had told him that he “has not made a firm decision about his political future” but that he was concerned about “the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season.” By joining the race late, Mr. Thompson may face questions about his ability to compete against the top-tier Republican candidates who have already raised at least $10 million each. He will also not participate in the Republican debate in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster and strategist who is not working for any candidate, said he was “surprised and a little sad” that Mr. Thompson had not declared himself a full-fledged candidate. Mr. Thompson has faced questions about his political commitment stemming from his days in the Senate. “Thompson will be competing against three guys who have been running flat out for months and working their tails off for well over a year,” Mr. Fabrizio said. “If you’re not going to get in this race and double-time on work, effort and commitment, how do you expect to win? You need to send signals that say, ‘I’m here and I’m going to win.’ “ Although Mr. Thompson planned in the coming days to create what is known as a “testing the waters” committee that would allow him to raise and spend money, members of Mr. Thompson’s inner circle said that if the next few weeks were encouraging, he could officially enter the race as early as July. “Fred Thompson is doing everything he has to do to gauge support to come to a final decision in a timely manner,” said Mark Corallo, who has been acting as his spokesman. The intense interest in Mr. Thompson’s trajectory reflected concern in the rival Republican camps about his possible appeal across the South, among conservative and evangelical voters, who might be attracted to his mainstream conservative stances, like opposition to and strong support for states’ rights. “There are still a lot of undecided voters in South Carolina, and Fred Thompson comes with enormous appeal — I’d call it -like appeal,” said Katon Dawson, the chairman of the Republican Party in South Carolina, which holds one of the first presidential primaries. Allies of Mr. Thompson said they were confident he would attract big-name contributors and present and former office holders now supporting other candidates. But potential competitors questioned his ability to make such inroads. Kate Phillips contributed reporting. &#x00bb; Get early access to articles from this Sunday's Times.

Trans fats in restaurants were next, and the French fry addicts mostly shrugged. But since the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that it was considering banning alcohol on commuter trains, it has been a different story. Estrin/The buy beer and soft drinks at Grand Central Terminal. Bankers and brokers and blue-collar workers spoke out in defense of the tradition of a Scotch and soda or a cold Budweiser on the ride home to Huntington or Greenwich. And the authority listened. Faced with an overwhelmingly negative response to the proposed ban, a committee of the authority’s board has recommended that the cocktail hour be allowed to continue on the trains and platforms of Metro-North railroads, according to a member of the committee and two people briefed on its findings. The full board is expected to take up the issue next month, and appears likely to follow the recommendation. The panel, which has been meeting for the last few months, received a thick sheaf of petitions signed by what officials estimated were thousands of commuters. And it met with representatives of rider groups who wanted to retain the end-of-day ritual. “It’s one of the things that makes this slog north or east palatable,” said Richard Shea, a public relations executive who helped start a group called Commuters Allied for Responsible Enjoyment, to defend what he described as “the romantic ideal” of the suburban commuter enjoying a drink on the way home — in his case, a Bud Light on the 6:52 to Chappaqua, in Westchester County. Mr. Shea encouraged fellow passengers to write to authority board members, urging them to block the proposal. At Pennsylvania Station and Grand Central Terminal yesterday, as riders stocked up on chardonnay and Bass ale for the trip home, many could not resist casting the issue in terms that went far beyond one evening’s round of beers. “People don’t like to have eyes over their shoulders 24/7,” said John Carnival, 43, an operating engineer from Massapequa Park, on Long Island, who bought two cans of Budweiser, packed in a plastic bag with ice, from a bar cart at Penn Station. He called the proposed ban “a little too much Big Brother.” Liquor service on commuter rail is a vestige of earlier days. Peter Derrick, a transit historian, said the commuter lines were modeled after interstate railroads, on which alcohol was a traditional amenity. Uniformed bartenders employed by Metro-North sell beer, wine, hard liquor, sodas and snacks from carts stationed near platforms at Grand Central Terminal on weekdays, beginning shortly after noon. The Long Island Railroad has carts staffed by bartenders on the platforms at Pennsylvania Station, and at the Hunterspoint Avenue, Jamaica and Flatbush Avenue stations, beginning about 3 p.m. During the evening rush, bartenders wheel their carts onto two Long Island-bound trains leaving Penn Station and sell alcohol to passengers during the trip. On Friday afternoons in the summer, sells alcohol from carts on the Cannonball, a train that travels from Hunterspoint to Montauk, carrying weekenders to the Hamptons. The only full-fledged bar cars that remain are on Metro-North’s New Haven line, and are run in cooperation with the State of Connecticut. On a typical weekday, 17 trains leaving Grand Central for cities like Stamford and Bridgeport from 12:07 p.m. to 9:07 p.m. include a bar car. The authority first agreed to consider a halt to alcohol sales on commuter trains and in rail stations in December, at the urging of Mitchell H. Pally, a board member from Long Island. Mr. Pally said he was concerned that passengers would drink on the train and then drive home, creating a liability for the authority if they became involved in an accident. He also said he worried that rowdy drinkers might be disturbing other passengers. A committee of five board members was created shortly afterward to study the idea. But data provided by the authority’s Police Department does not indicate widespread problems stemming from the sale of alcohol by the railroads. The police issued 287 tickets on Metro-North lines last year to people on trains or in stations who were drinking alcohol and creating a disturbance. Far more prevalent, the police said, were instances of people on commuter lines who needed medical help because of extreme drunkenness. There were 994 such cases on the two railroads last year, but officials said that in virtually every case, the riders appeared to have done most or all of their drinking before they ever got on a train. Each year, the railroad bartenders rank high in a customer satisfaction survey of Metro-North riders. In 2006, they received a favorable review from 97 percent of riders, who rated their courtesy and responsiveness second only to that of conductors, who scored 98 percent. Gene Colonese, the rail administrator for the Connecticut Transportation Department, said that an official from the department in April and strongly urged it not to change the policy, saying alcohol sales were “a valuable service to our customers.” The committee also of the two railroads, conductors and a representative of the authority’s police force, which patrols the commuter trains and stations. “There was no overwhelming evidence of drunkenness or anything like that, or accidents,” the board member said. He said the only person who to speak in favor of the ban was Mr. Pally. The committee finished its work earlier this month and submitted a report to Peter Kalikow, the authority’s chairman, and Elliot G. Sander, the chief executive and executive director. Mr. Kalikow and Mr. Sander declined to be interviewed about the committee’s recommendation. Mathew R. Warren contributed reporting.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/washington/31scotus.html Oral Dissents Give Ginsburg a New Voice on Court Dissents Give Ginsburg a New Voice on Court May 30 &#151; Whatever else may be said about the Supreme Court&#8217;s current term, which ends in about a month, it will be remembered as the time when Justice found her voice, and used it. two recent cases, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg read forceful dissents. Justices’ Topics: The Supreme Court case the court decided last month and the discrimination ruling it issued on Tuesday, Justice Ginsburg read forceful dissents from the bench. In each case, she spoke not only for herself but also for three other dissenting colleagues, Justices But the words were clearly her own, and they were both passionate and pointed. In the abortion case, in which the court upheld the federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act seven years after having struck down a similar state law, she noted that the court was now &#8220;differently composed than it was when we last considered a restrictive abortion regulation.&#8221; In the latest case, she summoned Congress to overturn what she called the majority&#8217;s &#8220;parsimonious reading&#8221; of the federal law against discrimination in the workplace. To read a dissent aloud is an act of theater that justices use to convey their view that the majority is not only mistaken, but profoundly wrong. It happens just a handful of times a year. Justice has used the technique to powerful effect, as has Justice Stevens, in a decidedly more low-key manner. The oral dissent has not been, until now, Justice Ginsburg&#8217;s style. She has gone years without delivering one, and never before in her 15 years on the court has she delivered two in one term. In her past dissents, both oral and written, she has been reluctant to breach the court&#8217;s collegial norms. &#8220;What she is saying is that this is not law, it&#8217;s politics,&#8221; Pamela S. Karlan, a Stanford law professor, said of Justice Ginsburg&#8217;s comment linking the outcome in the abortion case to the fact of the court&#8217;s changed membership. &#8220;She is accusing the other side of making political claims, not legal claims.&#8221; The justice&#8217;s acquaintances have watched with great interest what some depict as a late-career transformation. &#8220;Her style has always been very ameliorative, very conscious of etiquette,&#8221; said Cynthia Fuchs Epstein, the sociologist and a longtime friend. &#8220;She has always been regarded as sort of a white-glove person, and she&#8217;s achieved a lot that way. Now she is seeing that basic issues she&#8217;s fought so hard for are in jeopardy, and she is less bound by what have been the conventions of the court.&#8221; Some might say her dissents are an expression of sour grapes over being in the minority more often than not. But there may be strategic judgment, as well as frustration, behind Justice Ginsburg&#8217;s new style. She may have concluded that quiet collegiality has proved futile and that her new colleagues, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. Samuel A. Alito Jr. , are not open to persuasion on the issues that matter most to her. Justice Alito, of course, took the place of Justice , with whom Justice Ginsburg formed a deep emotional bond, although they differed on a variety of issues. And Chief Justice Roberts succeeded Chief Justice , with whom Justice Ginsburg often disagreed but maintained a relationship that was at times surprisingly productive. For example, in 1996, over Justice Scalia&#8217;s vigorous dissent, the chief justice gave Justice Ginsburg his vote in a decision holding that the &#8217;s men-only admissions policy was unconstitutional. In 2003, they made common cause in a case that strengthened the Family and Medical Leave Act. When Justice Ginsburg criticized a Rehnquist opinion, she did so gently; today&#8217;s adversary could be tomorrow&#8217;s ally. If there has been any such meeting of the minds between Justice Ginsburg and her new colleagues, it has not been evident. She may have concluded that her side&#8217;s interests are better served by appealing not to the court&#8217;s majority but to the public. &#8220;She&#8217;s sounding an alarm and wants people to take notice,&#8221; said Debra L. Ness, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, an advocacy group that focuses on the workplace. Goodwin Liu, a law professor at the , Berkeley, was one of Justice Ginsburg&#8217;s law clerks when the court decided the 2000 election case, the bitterly divided Bush v. Gore decision, from which she dissented. Even during that freighted period, Professor Liu said, &#8220;I was struck by how much of an institutional citizen she was, how attuned to the wishes of her colleagues and to not giving offense.&#8221; Professor Liu said that when he read the dissent on Tuesday, it occurred to him that in recounting the workplace travails of the plaintiff, Lilly M. Ledbetter, Justice Ginsburg was also telling a version of her own story. &#8220;Here she is, the one woman of a nine-member body, describing the get-along imperative and the desire not to make waves felt by the one woman among 16 men,&#8221; Professor Liu said. &#8220;It&#8217;s as if after 15 years on the court, she&#8217;s finally voicing some complaints of her own.&#8221; Another of the justice&#8217;s friends, Prof. Judith Resnik of Yale Law School, noted that throughout her legal career, Justice Ginsburg has been deeply concerned about questions of access to the courts and the remedial powers of federal judges, themes she has explored in both majority and dissenting opinions. &#8220;Those of us reading not just the grand-slam cases but the quieter ones have heard her voice,&#8221; Professor Resnik said. She added, &#8220;Now that the stakes are going up, more people will be listening.&#8221; &#x00bb; Gain access to The Archive - get it now with TimesSelect Court Ruling Limits State Control of Big Banks Justices Hear Arguments About Pacts On Pricing Government Urges Supreme Court to Stay Out of Times Case Supreme Court Opens Term With Short Session &#x00bb; Amazin's," 80-page Commemorative Newspaper and Box

Islamic militant posed this week in a Palestinian Ain al Hilwe. al Hilwe became a jihadi hotbed about five years ago. More than 25 men from there alone have gone to Iraq to fight, Hamas and Fatah officials say, never to be seen again. “The gunmen tied their hands, then forced them to stand at the stairs while they broke all the screens, and then the server and the television and the photocopier,” said the owner, Hamad, of the attack a few months ago. “Then they burned all 36 computers.” In recent months in Gaza, there have been similar attacks on music and video shops and pharmacies accused of selling Viagra, as well as on American and A standoff between the Lebanese Army and Islamists at a Palestinian has focused attention on a jihadist element taking root there as well as a radicalization themselves. With the fragmentation of authority in Gaza, and its isolation, said a Gazan analyst, Taysir Mhaisin, “there is an increase of fundamentalism and the birth of groups believing in violence and practicing violence as a model created by bin Ladenism.” Mouin Rabbani, a Jordan-based analyst of Palestinian politics for the International Crisis Group, said, “There is a security vacuum that creates space for all kinds of new grouplets and forces.” Palestinian authority, both and in refugee beyond, used to lie in the hands of Fatah, the nationalist faction once led by . But after the entry of militant into politics, its 2006 electoral defeat of Fatah and the battles between them, jihadi freelancers with murky links are filling a vacuum in Gaza and in the camps in Lebanon. Bush administration officials say they are increasingly concerned that Hamas and even more radical groups may be hijacking the Palestinian movement. The officials say they see no operational connection between what is happening in Palestinian the deterioration in Gaza. But they say they do see an ideological link, with hopeless and marginalized young people turning to jihad because they believe that more secular or moderate options have failed them. In the squalid streets of the Ain al Hilwe refugee camp outside the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, people like Abu Ahmed Taha are bracing for a fight they have long been dreading. Militias in the camp of 47,000 roam the streets armed and ready; skirmishes break out sporadically and tensions have never been higher. For Mr. Taha, the real danger is that the fastest-growing militias are those of jihadis with wholly different aspirations from his. “There is a central problem and that is , and they are spreading,” Mr. Taha said, after an emergency meeting of religious and political leaders in the camp last week to calm tensions. “The Islamic awakening has been going on for 25 years now. But this, now, is going to become a huge problem for us.” Mr. Taha’s fears are remarkable because of who he is: not a secular campaigner or a Fatah apparatchik, but a senior member of Hamas. In the violent underground of the militias, men like him have become unlikely moderates, calling for calm and seeking to build bonds with the other militias and the government. Security officials and analysts say groups inspired by Al Qaeda have had a presence a decade, where they have thrived, taking advantage of the lawlessness and poor living conditions. In Lebanon, Palestinians are not allowed to own property and are limited in the kind of work they can do. They generally enjoy few rights. Ain al Hilwe, too, became a jihadi hotbed about five years ago. More than 25 men from there alone have gone to Iraq to fight, Hamas and Fatah officials say, never to be seen again. And jihadis there say more are ready to go. Mr. Taha notes that the new groups make it easy to join. Whereas it may take years of inculcation for a young man to become a full-fledged member of Hamas, he can become a member of the jihadi militias just by declaring fealty, Mr. Taha said. And rather than focusing on a political education, the militia members focus on a global fight coupled with religious sloganeering. Whether these jihadist groups are part of Al Qaeda or simply local bands of religious fanatics, Westerners and their institutions are now more clearly under attack throughout the region, including in Gaza, as seen in the bombing of the schools and in the kidnappings of two Fox News correspondents and of Alan Johnston, the BBC’s Gaza correspondent. A shadowy group called the Army of Islam claims that it kidnapped Mr. Johnston in March. Steven Erlanger reported from Jerusalem, and Hassan M. Fattah from Lebanon.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/sports/football/31concussions.html rate of diagnosed clinical depression among retired National Football League players is strongly correlated with the number of concussions they sustained, according to a study to be published today. Keane for former New England player Ted Johnson has said that his depression had been linked to concussions. An Answer to Help Clear His Fog The draft is now complete. Look back at the picks as they happened on the Fifth Down blog. Randy Moss a Mistake for the Patriots? Go to the Fifth Down Blog » The study was conducted by the University of North Carolina ’s and based on a general health survey of 2,552 retired N.F.L. players. It corroborates other findings regarding brain trauma and later-life depression in other subsets of the general population, but runs counter to longtime assertions by the N.F.L. that concussions in football have no long-term effects. As the most comprehensive study of football players to date, the paper will add to the escalating debate over the effects of and proper approach to football-related concussions. The study, which will appear in the journal of the American College of Sports Medicine, found that of the 595 players who recalled sustaining three or more concussions on the football field, 20.2 percent said they had been found to have depression. That is three times the rate of players who have not sustained concussions. The full data, the study reports, “call into question how effectively retired professional football players with a history of three or more concussions are able to meet the mental and physical demands of life after playing professional football.” In January, a neuropathologist claimed that repeated concussions likely contributed to the November suicide of the former player Andre Waters. Three weeks later, the former linebacker Ted Johnson not only revealed that his significant depression and cognitive decline had been linked by a neurologist to on-field concussions, but also claimed that his most damaging concussion had been sustained after his coach, , coerced him into practicing against the advice of team doctors. While consistently defending its teams’ treatment of concussions and denying any relationship between players’ brain trauma and later neurocognitive decline, the N.F.L. has subsequently announced several related initiatives. The league and its players union recently created a fund to help pay the medical expenses of players suffering from Alzheimer’s disease or similar dementia. Last week, N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell announced wide-ranging league guidelines regarding concussions, from obligatory neuropsychological testing for all players to what he called a “whistle-blower system” where players and doctors can anonymously report any coach’s attempt to override the wishes of concussed players or medical personnel. The N.F.L. has criticized previous papers published by the — which identified similar links between on-field concussions and both later mild cognitive impairment and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease — and reasserted those concerns this week with regard to the paper on depression. Several members of the league’s mild traumatic brain injury committee cited two main issues in telephone interviews this week: that the survey was returned by 69 percent of the retired players to whom it was mailed, and that those who did respond were relying solely on their memories of on-field concussions. One committee member, Dr. Henry Feuer of the Indiana University Medical Center and a medical consultant for the , went so far as to call the center’s findings “virtually worthless.” Dr. Ira Casson, the co-chairman of the committee, said, “Survey studies are the weakest type of research study — they’re subject to all kinds of error and misinterpretation and miscalculation.” Regarding the issue of players’ recollection of brain trauma, Dr. Casson said: “They had no objective evaluations to determine whether or not what the people told them in the surveys was correct or not. They didn’t have information from doctors confirming it, they didn’t have tests, they didn’t have examinations. They didn’t have anything. They just kind of took people’s words for it.” According to other experts, the 69 percent return rate was quite high for such survey research, which has been widely used to establish preliminary links between smoking and lung cancer, explore the relationship between diet and health, and track trends in obesity and drug use. After reading the depression study and considering the league’s issues with recollective survey research, Dr. John Whyte, the director of the Moss Rehabilitation Research Institute in Philadelphia and an expert in neurological research methodology, said he did not share the league’s criticisms. “To the person who says this is worthless, let’s just discard a third of the medical literature that we trust and go by today,” said Dr. Whyte, who has no connection with either the N.F.L. or the which is partly funded by the N.F.L. players union. “Here, the response rate was good and not a relevant issue to the findings. We have some pretty solid data that multiple concussions caused cumulative brain damage and increased risk of depression, and that is not in conflict with the growing literature. “Do I think this one study proves the point beyond doubt? No. Does it contribute in a meaningful way? You bet.” (1 of 26) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off Days Follow Hard-Hitting Career in N.F.L.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/world/middleeast/31palestinians.html May 30 — It was 2 a.m. when masked gunmen raided Al Wafa Net in the Khan Yunis camp in Gaza where 17 young men were surfing the Internet. Islamic militant posed this week in a Palestinian Ain al Hilwe. al Hilwe became a jihadi hotbed about five years ago. More than 25 men from there alone have gone to Iraq to fight, Hamas and Fatah officials say, never to be seen again. “The gunmen tied their hands, then forced them to stand at the stairs while they broke all the screens, and then the server and the television and the photocopier,” said the owner, Hamad, of the attack a few months ago. “Then they burned all 36 computers.” In recent months in Gaza, there have been similar attacks on music and video shops and pharmacies accused of selling Viagra, as well as on American and A standoff between the Lebanese Army and Islamists at a Palestinian has focused attention on a jihadist element taking root there as well as a radicalization themselves. With the fragmentation of authority in Gaza, and its isolation, said a Gazan analyst, Taysir Mhaisin, “there is an increase of fundamentalism and the birth of groups believing in violence and practicing violence as a model created by bin Ladenism.” Mouin Rabbani, a Jordan-based analyst of Palestinian politics for the International Crisis Group, said, “There is a security vacuum that creates space for all kinds of new grouplets and forces.” Palestinian authority, both and in refugee beyond, used to lie in the hands of Fatah, the nationalist faction once led by . But after the entry of militant into politics, its 2006 electoral defeat of Fatah and the battles between them, jihadi freelancers with murky links are filling a vacuum in Gaza and in the camps in Lebanon. Bush administration officials say they are increasingly concerned that Hamas and even more radical groups may be hijacking the Palestinian movement. The officials say they see no operational connection between what is happening in Palestinian the deterioration in Gaza. But they say they do see an ideological link, with hopeless and marginalized young people turning to jihad because they believe that more secular or moderate options have failed them. In the squalid streets of the Ain al Hilwe refugee camp outside the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, people like Abu Ahmed Taha are bracing for a fight they have long been dreading. Militias in the camp of 47,000 roam the streets armed and ready; skirmishes break out sporadically and tensions have never been higher. For Mr. Taha, the real danger is that the fastest-growing militias are those of jihadis with wholly different aspirations from his. “There is a central problem and that is , and they are spreading,” Mr. Taha said, after an emergency meeting of religious and political leaders in the camp last week to calm tensions. “The Islamic awakening has been going on for 25 years now. But this, now, is going to become a huge problem for us.” Mr. Taha’s fears are remarkable because of who he is: not a secular campaigner or a Fatah apparatchik, but a senior member of Hamas. In the violent underground of the militias, men like him have become unlikely moderates, calling for calm and seeking to build bonds with the other militias and the government. Security officials and analysts say groups inspired by Al Qaeda have had a presence a decade, where they have thrived, taking advantage of the lawlessness and poor living conditions. In Lebanon, Palestinians are not allowed to own property and are limited in the kind of work they can do. They generally enjoy few rights. Ain al Hilwe, too, became a jihadi hotbed about five years ago. More than 25 men from there alone have gone to Iraq to fight, Hamas and Fatah officials say, never to be seen again. And jihadis there say more are ready to go. Mr. Taha notes that the new groups make it easy to join. Whereas it may take years of inculcation for a young man to become a full-fledged member of Hamas, he can become a member of the jihadi militias just by declaring fealty, Mr. Taha said. And rather than focusing on a political education, the militia members focus on a global fight coupled with religious sloganeering. Whether these jihadist groups are part of Al Qaeda or simply local bands of religious fanatics, Westerners and their institutions are now more clearly under attack throughout the region, including in Gaza, as seen in the bombing of the schools and in the kidnappings of two Fox News correspondents and of Alan Johnston, the BBC’s Gaza correspondent. A shadowy group called the Army of Islam claims that it kidnapped Mr. Johnston in March. Steven Erlanger reported from Jerusalem, and Hassan M. Fattah from Lebanon. Taghreed El-Khodary contributed reporting from Gaza, Helene Cooper from Washington, and Nada Bakri from Ain al Hilwe, Lebanon. &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off ANALYSIS; Reality Overtakes the Illusion of Unity in Gaza Israel Withdraws From Gaza as Truce Begins, Unsteadily Israel Adds Gaza Force but Forgoes Big Escalation Big Israeli Strike With Tanks Kills 8 Palestinians in Gaza Armament, Defense and Military Forces &#x00bb;
