The Taliban claimed responsibility. Initial reports suggested the helicopter was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade, the U.S. military official, who was not authorized to release the information, said on condition of anonymity. It was not clear if there were any survivors, the official said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force confirmed that one of its helicopters crashed in southern Afghanistan, but it released no other details. A purported Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, claimed in a phone call to The Associated Press that militants had shot the helicopter down in Helmand province. That claim could not be immediately verified. AP reporter Lolita Baldor in Washington contributed to this report (Copyright 2007 by The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.)
http://www.komotv.com/news/national/7764187.html Unpredictable whales leave rescuers with new data, questions whales leave rescuers with new data, questions AM PDT AM PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - The mysterious journey two humpback whales made into the Sacramento River was a great deal for the humans. Scientists got more face time with the species than they had ever enjoyed before, and thousands of sightseers got a whale-watching tour for free. What did the whales get? A gash in the side, a shot of antibiotics, some blasts with a fire hose. Perhaps that's why they apparently slipped back to sea under the cover of darkness, without so much as a goodbye. The unpredictable duo, believed to be a mother and calf, were last seen at sunset Tuesday less than 10 miles from the Golden Gate Bridge, after they traveled 25 miles southwest from another busy bridge. The convoy of boats that accompanied them across the bay to keep traffic at a distance abandoned their escort service when it got dark. Officials believe the whales slipped out of San Francisco Bay to the open sea late Tuesday or early Wednesday, when no one was watching. "With no confirmed sighting in the bay, we feel confident that it is highly likely that the animals are outside the Golden Gate," said Scott Hill, a division manager for the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration. For the first time since the pair were spotted near Sacramento on May 13, a whole day passed without any sightings of the whales. Officials became increasingly assured that the humpbacks, injured by a boat during their sojurn inland, were on the move and decided to stop searching. Marine scientists said Wednesday that although they will never know why the pair swam 90 miles inland, the massive operation to rescue the humpbacks yielded valuable information about the endangered species. It was the first time the same humpbacks were studied in the wild for so long, according to Bernadette Fees, deputy director of the California Department of Fish and Game. The information scientists gathered includes sound recordings, logs of their behavior and tissue samples from both the mother and calf, which will be analyzed to determine if they come from a pod of whales that travel between Mexico and California. "All those things are very hard to get. So what we are doing is filling up the knowledge bank on humpback whales in the wild," said Jim Oswald, a spokesman for the nonprofit Marine Mammal Center, a private scientific and rescue organization. The experience also could prove helpful in approaching other stranded whales, he said. After the whales were spotted near Sacramento on May 13, officials spent days trying to goad them back to the ocean, playing recordings of other whales, surrounding them with boats, blasting them with fire hoses and banging on metal pipes dangling beneath the water. Those involved in the rescue effort said they did not know if the various methods had hastened the whales' exit or hindered it. But they speculated Wednesday that antibiotics given to the whales on Saturday to try to slow the damage from their wounds may have marked a turning point, since the pair began their hasty retreat from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta after that. Biologists said the saltier water where the mother humpback whale and her calf had been swimming since leaving the delta helped reverse some of the health problems caused by long exposure to fresh water. Officials were unsure how much was spent on the rescue efforts, but they insisted the expenditures of time and money were justified, if not required under wildlife protection laws. "We certainly have a moral obligation as the agency assigned to protect them to do everything practical to get them safely into their natural habitat," said Brian Gorman, a spokesman for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Biologists originally had planned to attach a satellite tracking tag to the mother humpback, but gusty winds and malfunctioning equipment stymied them. Distinct markings on both whales' tails were photographed so they could be identified in the future, Fees said. They might even make another inland trip someday. Humphrey, a humpback that famously strayed into San Francisco Bay in 1985, reappeared there five years later. "If we learned anything about these two, it is that they will do what they do when they want to do it," Fees said.
http://www.komotv.com/news/national/7754737.html Saudi Arabian Guantanamo detainee dies in apparent suicide Arabian Guantanamo detainee dies in apparent suicide PM PDT PM PDT SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) - A Saudi Arabian detainee died Wednesday at Guantanamo Bay prison and the U.S. military said he apparently committed suicide. Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee in his cell unresponsive and not breathing Wednesday afternoon, the U.S. military's Southern Command said in a statement. "They tried to save his life but he was pronounced dead," said Mario Alvarez, a Miami-based spokesman for the command. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Details, including the prisoner's name and manner of death, were not released. A spokesman for detention operations, Navy Cmdr. Rick Haupt, declined to comment, referring questions to the Miami-based Southern Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Caribbean and Latin America. The death came as the U.S. military prepared to try two detainees - Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni, and Omar Khadr, a Canadian who was 15 when he was captured in a firefight with U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Their arraignment is scheduled to proceed on Monday at Guantanamo as planned, Navy Cmdr. Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, said late Wednesday. Khadr on Wednesday fired his American attorneys, leaving him without defense counsel as his arraignment approaches, his former U.S. military attorney said. "He doesn't trust American lawyers, and I don't particularly blame him," said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." The military toughened security at the prison camp following the previous suicides and an uprising last spring, taking measures to remove access to light fixtures and other possible makeshift weapons. About 380 men are held at the isolated prison camp on suspicion of links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. The Naval Criminal Investigative Service is conducting an ongoing investigation into the three previous suicides. A cultural adviser was helping the military handle the remains. "The remains of the deceased detainee are being treated with the utmost respect," the military said.
http://www.komotv.com/news/national/7764157.html Labor leaders divided over farm guest-worker provisions in immigration bill leaders divided over farm guest-worker provisions in immigration bill AM PDT AM PDT SANGER, Calif. (AP) - In the 1960s, farm labor leader Cesar Chavez rallied fieldhands to speak out against a guest worker program that recruited millions of Mexicans to pick crops at low wages. Today, farmworker advocates are throwing their weight behind a proposal in the current Senate immigration bill that would bring thousands of laborers to the country's most productive fields but offer them virtually no chance of putting down roots in the U.S. The United Farm Workers say it is their best shot at improving working conditions in fields nationwide, and especially in California, where 92 percent of workers are foreign-born. Activists complain that immigrant farmworkers are sometimes underpaid, not paid at all, overworked, exposed to pesticides, given poor housing or subject to other abuses. Some aging members of the last temporary-worker push - the Bracero Program, which operated from 1942 to 1964 - worry the plan could repeat past indignities. "If they're going to have braceros again, well, they need protection," said Agustin Oropeza, an 82-year-old from Zamora, Mexico, who picked oranges, lemons, lettuce and tomatoes in California in the 1940s and '50s. "They can't just leave them to sleep in the middle of the fields and drink from puddles, like they did with us." The proposed AgJobs program brokered between growers and the UFW over the past decade would open the way to legal status for those who worked in U.S. agriculture for at least 150 days over a two-year period ending Dec. 31, 2006. The program would be capped at 1.5 million. After that, new farm laborers would be recruited in their home countries and brought to the U.S. under an existing guest worker program, but would be able to stay for only 10 months at a time. They would not automatically qualify for citizenship and would have to wait an estimated eight years just to get on line. Even then, they would have little chance of winning permanent residency, because a new point system would give higher priority to people with education and skills. Farmers who claim labor shortages left fruit rotting on the ground last summer say it is a fair agreement. Union leaders are dismayed that newer recruits will not get a pathway to citizenship. Farmworker advocates previously had sought to insert that provision but said they had to sacrifice several key points to keep the compromise alive in this year's version of the bill. "We're willing to work through the process so we're at the table," said Diana Tellefson, executive director of the UFW Foundation, a nonprofit organization linked to the union. "We're going to fight tooth and nail to make sure that workers have the protections they need." The AFL-CIO and the Laborers' union oppose the broader immigration bill, arguing that workers here on a temporary basis are more vulnerable to labor violations. The AFL-CIO contends some pickers will stay in this country illegally rather than go home when their time is up - something that happened under the Bracero Program, too. Lulu Valdez, a young mother in Porterville, said her relatives in Mexico who work in the sugarcane harvest would willingly come to the U.S. for just a few months each year. But she added: "I just think a broader amnesty would be a lot better." The old Bracero program brought some 4.6 million Mexicans to the U.S. to work on farms and in railyards, easing the labor shortages that developed on the homefront during World War II. Chavez spoke out frequently against the program in the 1960s, which he believed exploited Mexican workers and kept down wages for domestic farmworkers. At the time, about half of the farm labor consisted of U.S. citizens. Now the bulk of the force is foreign-born. Russel Efird, who heads the Farm Bureau Federation in Fresno County, which produced $4.85 billion in crops and livestock last year, said he cannot be assured he can harvest his plum orchard unless AgJobs passes. "We know it's a fact that we have undocumented workers working in our fields," Efird said. "But if we can't get our crops harvested then where is our food going to come from?" sparks chaos with reckless U-turns

http://www.komotv.com/news/national/7764222.html Lugovoi alleges British involvement in poisoning death of ex-KGB agent alleges British involvement in poisoning death of ex-KGB agent Russian businessman Andrei Lugovoi, left, enters Interfax news agency for a news conference in Moscow, Thursday, May 31, 2007. AM PDT AM PDT MOSCOW (AP) - The Russian businessman whom Britain has named as a suspect in the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko claimed Thursday that he has evidence of British special services' involvement in the poisoning death. Andrei Lugovoi, himself a former KGB agent, said Litvinenko tried to recruit him to gather compromising materials about Russian President Vladimir Putin for MI6, Britain's foreign intelligence agency. He claimed that British security services were unhappy with Litvinenko for boasting of his contacts with senior MI6 officials and spilling secrets. "It's hard to get rid of the thought that Litvinenko was an agent who got out of the secret service's control and was eliminated," Lugovoi told a news conference. "Even if it was not done by the secret service itself, it was done under its control or connivance." A British government security official, who demanded anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the allegations were untrue. Britain's Foreign Office, responsible for MI6, declined to comment. Lugovoi claimed he had evidence of his allegations but that he would only give details to Russian investigators. Britain last week said it had enough evidence to charge Lugovoi, who also worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB, in the November killing of Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210, had fled to Britain several years earlier after becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin and received British citizenship. Lugovoi and another Russian had met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Britain has requested Lugovoi's extradition, but Russia has refused, saying its constitution does not permit it. Lugovoi dismissed the British accusations against him as an attempt to divert attention from Litvinenko's contacts with British spy services. He claimed Litvinenko tried to recruit him during one of several business trips to Britain last year. At one point, he said, Litvinenko gave him a book for coding communications and a cell phone for contact with his British spy handlers. He said he refused to betray his country. "In conversations with me, Litvinenko often went beyond his role as a recruitment agent and told me many things he shouldn't have said," Lugovoi said. "I got an impression that he was really getting out of British secret services' control. He believed that the British undervalued him and paid him too little for his service." Oleg Gordievsky, a former top KGB spy who worked for MI6 and defected to Britain, dismissed Lugovoi's claims as "silly fantasies." He said Litvinenko had worked for domestic branches of the KGB and post-Soviet security structures and was of no interest to British intelligence. "MI6 not interested in information about the domestic service," Gordievsky, who was a friend of Litvinenko, said on British Broadcasting Corp. television. "Litvinenko was not needed. He made signals that he might be prepared, but they said, 'We don't need you,' so he didn't work for MI6." Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, urged British authorities to help investigate the "very serious accusations against British secret services." "I do believe they will take these new versions as seriously as it should be done," Kosachev said on Russia Today television. Lugovoi also claimed that Boris Berezovsky, a Russian billionaire living in self-exile in London who is among Putin's most powerful political foes, might have been involved in Litvinenko's death. Lugovoi said Litvinenko was angry after Berezovsky, his longtime friend and patron, cut a living allowance he paid Litvinenko. Lugovoi claimed that Litvinenko told him he could prove that the tycoon received political asylum in Britain under false pretenses. Russia has long sought Berezovsky's extradition to face charges of financial crimes that date back to the 1990s. Berezovsky says the charges are politically motivated. Lugovoi claimed that Berezovsky, who briefly served as a deputy secretary of Russia's presidential Security Council during the 1990s, also was an MI6 agent and gave British intelligence sensitive information about Russia. Berezovsky called Lugovoi's allegations "absolutely false." "MI6 absolutely knows who are agents for its organization, it knows Berezovsky is not on that list," Berezovsky told The Associated Press. This is not the story of Lugovoi, this is the story the Kremlin wants to present to the world. The Kremlin in a corner. Putin is in a corner."
http://www.komotv.com/news/national/7764272.html Spain makes court claim over sunken colonial-era treasure makes court claim over sunken colonial-era treasure Odyssey co-founder Greg Stemm, left, and Project Manager Tom Dettweiler examine a coin recovered from the "Black Swan" shipwreck. AM PDT AM PDT TAMPA, Fla. (AP) - The Spanish government has filed claims in U.S. federal court over a shipwreck that a Florida firm found laden with colonial-era treasure, an attorney said Thursday. If the vessel was Spanish or was removed from that country's waters, any treasure would belong to Spain, said James Goold, an attorney representing the government. "It's a very well established principle under Spanish, U.S. and international law that a government such as the kingdom of Spain has not abandoned its sunken ships or sunken property, and that a company like Odyssey Marine Exploration may not conduct recovery operations without authorization by the government," he said. "The kingdom of Spain has not authorized any such operations by Odyssey, and by these legal actions it will see the return of any Spanish property Odyssey has recovered," Goold said of the claims filed Wednesday. Odyssey Marine Exploration Inc. co-founder Greg Stemm said Thursday the company was working on a statement in response to Spain's claims. He has previously called Spain's legal threats "absurd" and said that Odyssey would notify all claimants once it conclusively determined the ship's identity. The company announced two weeks ago that it had discovered a shipwreck containing 500,000 gold and silver coins somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. The Tampa-based company said the site was outside any country's territorial waters but would not give the exact location or name of the ship. Odyssey has said that the ship was not in Spanish territorial waters and was not the HMS Sussex, a shipwreck that Odyssey recently got permission from the Spanish government to search for in the Strait of Gibraltar. But Spain has called the new discovery suspicious and said the booty may have come from a wrecked Spanish galleon. In Britain, the find generated press reports that Odyssey had salvaged the wreck of the long-sought British vessel Merchant Royal, which sank in bad weather off England in 1641. Odyssey has not confirmed or denied these reports. Spain is using the U.S. law firm Covington & Burling, which has represented Spain over shipwreck cases before, including the recovery of material from two ships, Juno and La Galga, in a 2000 court case. The Spanish government won the case at that time.
http://www.komotv.com/news/national/7755632.html 'Law & Order' actor Thompson moves toward White House bid & Order' actor Thompson moves toward White House bid PM PDT PM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - Fred Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and ''Law & Order'' actor, is taking significant steps toward an expected summer entry into the crowded but extraordinarily unsettled Republican presidential race. His likely candidacy could give restless conservatives somewhere to turn. A crucial bloc of the GOP, those voters have not fully embraced the leading contenders, giving Thompson what his backers argue is an opening for a ''true conservative'' who can triumph in November 2008. The 64-year-old Southerner would bring a right-leaning Senate voting record with a few digressions from GOP orthodoxy and a dash of Hollywood star power given his many movie roles and TV stint as the gruff district attorney on NBC's popular crime drama. A Thompson bid also could make the contest to succeed President Bush even more topsy turvy; all three top-tier candidates - Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and Mitt Romney - could lose some measure of support and the seven underdogs could become even more irrelevant. Thompson will make his first formal campaign move in the coming days, establishing an official organization to weigh a White House bid while launching a major fundraising drive on Monday, according to several Republicans with knowledge of his plans. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the timeline is not public, these officials said Thompson may visit early primary states in late June and could officially enter the race as early as the first week in July. ''Senator Thompson is still seriously considering getting into the presidential contest and he is doing everything he has to do to make that final decision,'' said Mark Corallo, a Thompson spokesman. ''Stay tuned.'' On Thompson's schedule in the coming weeks: a speech to Virginia Republicans in Richmond on Saturday and an appearance with Jay Leno on ''The Tonight Show'' on June 12. One official said an overseas trip also may be in the works. For months, Thompson has openly flirted with a candidacy as a Tennessee-based effort sought to draft him into the race. He made several high-profile moves that pointed to a bid, not the least of which was disclosing that he is in remission after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer. His popularity in national polls spiked to double digits early in the year, but while he still fares well in surveys, his numbers have fallen following what some Republicans considered a subpar speech in early May in California. That's prompted some rumblings in GOP circles that Thompson may have missed his opportunity to make a splash in the race. Undaunted, Thompson has been casting himself as a straight-talking conservative in the mold of former President Reagan in speeches and on the Internet. ''He's not Ronald Reagan, but he's Reaganesque,'' said Ted Malloch of Palm Beach, Fla., the chief executive of a consulting firm who is supporting Thompson. ''Fred is unique in the sense that all the boxes have been checked.'' During his 1994-2002 Senate tenure, he was considered a reliably conservative vote. He worked to limit the role of the federal government and backed a ban on a late-term abortion procedure. He voted in favor of Bush's tax cuts, oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, eliminating money for the National Endowment for the Arts and a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. And, he voted against requiring criminal background checks for purchases at gun shows. But he sometimes took paths that didn't necessarily sit well with conservatives, including advocating for campaign finance reform. While he voted to oust President Clinton from office, he also was one of 10 Republican senators who voted against one of the two impeachment charges. Social issues, important to the party's right, also typically weren't at the top of his agenda. He was known less as a legislator and more as an investigator, leading the committee that examined former President Clinton's fundraising in 1996. Yet, he established a reputation as a less-than-hard worker. The Democratic National Committee issued a research document Wednesday detailing Thompson's major legislative accomplishments. Save for the title and a DNC disclaimer, it was blank. Thompson was one of the few senators who backed underdog McCain in 2000 over George W. Bush, the establishment candidate. This time around, Thompson would be opposing McCain _ and could hurt his friend's own shot at the White House. The two have similar Senate records but Thompson could be seen as a fresher face to McCain, who is well-known to GOP voters. Romney, who is trying to position himself to the right of the major candidates, also could see his support fall among conservatives concerned about his shifts on issues. Campaigning in Iowa, Romney said he welcomed a Thompson entry. ''I think he'll make the race more interesting. He's got good ideas and after all, he does put bad people in jail every week on 'Law & Order,''' he said. Giuliani could be hindered as well if Thompson grabs the attention of Republicans uneasy with the former New York City mayor's support for gay and abortion rights. Campaigning in California, Giuliani said he would welcome Thompson, but argued that he was the stronger candidate based on his record of cutting taxes and combatting terrorism as well as his ability to win a general election. Ticking off states that went Democratic in 2004, such as California and New York, Giuliani said, ''Those are all states Republicans gave away in the past and the Democrats took for granted. ... It doesn't mean I'll win all of them, but if I win my fair share of them, then I'll get elected.'' Over the next few days, Thompson plans to form a ''testing the waters'' committee called ''Friends of Fred Thompson,'' which will allow him to begin raising money, hire staff and gauge support without officially committing to a White House bid. He could significantly dampen the fundraising ability of his potential GOP rivals during the homestretch of the second quarter financial reporting period. ''It's going to cause everybody to have second thoughts about writing a check,'' said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who is unaligned in the race. Thompson spoke on a conference call Wednesday to several dozen people who officials called ''First Day Founders'' and said committed to raising money for him. Participants said they were asked to raise $46,000 apiece, the $2,300 maximum from 10 couples or 20 people. Officials cautioned that Thompson has made no final decision.
http://www.komotv.com/news/national/7764132.html U.S. investigating how TB traveler eluded border guards investigating how TB traveler eluded border guards Grady Memorial Hospital is shown Wed., May 30, 2007. An unidentified tuberculosis patient is being held under Federal quarantine at the facility. AM PDT AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - The government is investigating how a globe-trotting tuberculosis patient drove back into the country even after his name was put on a no-fly list provided to border guards. The failure exposed a major gap in a system that is supposed to keep the direst of diseases from crossing borders. But the communications breakdown at a U.S.-Canada border crossing was only one of a series of missed opportunities to catch the Atlanta man and his wife who seemed determined to elude health officials. And worried infection specialists say it shows how vulnerable the nation is, from outdated quarantine laws and the speed of international flight, to killer germs carried by travelers. What if, they ask, the now-quarantined man had carried not hard-to-spread tuberculosis but something very contagious like the next super-flu? "It's regretful that we weren't able to stop that," said Dr. Martin Cetron of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said of how the man fled when U.S. health officials tracked him down in Rome and told him not to get on an airplane. Should the CDC have asked Italian health authorities to put the man in isolation there? That was under discussion when the CDC learned the man had fled, Cetron said. "We need to rely on people to do the right thing," Cetron said, saying the CDC hesitates to invoke its quarantine powers. "Can we improve our systems? Absolutely. There will be many lessons learned from this." The man has a rare but exceptionally dangerous form of TB, a type that international health authorities are desperate to curb because it is untreatable by most medications. The CDC was a step, or more, behind the man on his six-country odyssey. His name didn't get on the no-fly list until he apparently already was en route to Canada, Cetron said. But the CDC did get word to U.S. Customs and Border Patrol before the man and his wife crossed into the country at Champlain, N.Y., a Department of Homeland Security spokesman told The Associated Press on Wednesday. Customs "is reviewing the facts involved with the decision to admit the individuals into the country without isolation," said DHS spokesman Russ Knocke. Both Homeland Security's inspector general and internal affairs officials are investigating, reflecting the seriousness of the case, Knocke said. Congress is probing, too. The House Homeland Security Committee has scheduled a June 6 hearing. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the case "shows that something is wrong with the training and supervision of our border agents. We put all this time and effort into identifying those who shouldn't enter our country, but what good is it if it can be brushed aside by a border guard? I shudder to think that this individual could have been a terrorist." Border security isn't the only issue. While the man now is cooperating with CDC investigators, he remains in federally ordered isolation, in a guarded room in an Atlanta hospital. His identity is being withheld to protect his privacy. But the nation's quarantine laws are so outdated that if the TB traveler challenged that order, "he would probably win in court," warned Lawrence Gostin, a public health law expert at Georgetown University who has advised the CDC's ongoing effort to update those laws. "There is a hole" in the nation's disease-security system, Gostin added. "The person's instinct to get back to the United States in this case is understandable. But that's exactly what the law's there for, to prevent a person from endangering other people. ... We need to update the entire process." Adding to the complexity is the tracking down of roughly 80 passengers who were close enough to the man on two trans-Atlantic flights to potentially have been exposed to TB, plus 27 crew members. The CDC has pushed for years for faster access to electronic lists of air passengers to trace their whereabouts in disease emergencies, and hopes to have new regulations to ease that access in place later this year. Where was he missed? The saga begins in mid-May, when Fulton County, Ga., health department officials say they told the man he had a drug-resistant form of TB and should not travel. The man contacted his hometown newspaper to contradict that, saying he was never told to cancel his May 12 flight to Paris for his wedding and honeymoon. The CDC caught up with him by cell phone in Rome a week and a half later, telling him that updated test results showed he had the worst form of TB, called "extensively drug-resistant" or XDR-TB. Cetron said a CDC official told him not to get on an airplane, that U.S. officials were working on how to get him home, but in the meantime he could seek medical care through the U.S. embassy or Italian hospitals. The man told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he interpreted that conversation as being stuck in Italy, and decided to sneak home, flying from Prague to Montreal and then driving to New York, because he feared he would die without treatment in the U.S. "I thought to myself: You're nuts. I wasn't going to do that. They told me I had been put on the no-fly list and my passport was flagged," the man said. Still, the man didn't violate any laws and faces no charges, CDC said. "There's a whole body of public health law that's going to be closely scrutinized and redefined with this case," said Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert who advises the government. "It's going to be looking back at what do you do when you have a non-compliant carrier of some infectious agent that is border-hopping?"

http://www.komotv.com/news/national/7744857.html Parents of missing British girl meet pope in St. Peter's Square of missing British girl meet pope in St. Peter's Square AM PDT AM PDT VATICAN CITY (AP) - Pope Benedict XVI held the hands of the parents of 4-year-old Madeleine McCann on Wednesday, blessing them and a photo of the girl as they asked for prayers for their daughter who disappeared while on a family vacation in Portugal. The pope spoke with the parents, each dressed in dark suits, as he greeted dignitaries seated in the front row during his weekly general audience in St. Peter's Square. "He was very kind, very sincere," Kate McCann told a news conference. She said Benedict assured them that he would "continue to pray for Madeleine's safe return." "It was more personal than I ever could have imagined," said Gerry McCann, adding that Benedict immediately recognized Madeleine's photograph. "His touch and thoughts and words were more tender than we could have hoped and that will sustain us during this most difficult time," he said. The Vatican had readily accepted the British couple's request to meet with the pope, as they press their campaign to publicize their daughter's disappearance. Devout Catholics, they recently prayed at the pilgrimage site in Fatima, Portugal, for her safe return. The couple also outlined plans in the hunt for their daughter, saying they would travel to Spain, Germany and the Netherlands - countries that send many tourists to the vacation area in Portugal. Gerry McCann brought a poster of his missing daughter, which has been widely distributed, to the news conference at the residence of the British ambassador to the Vatican. He said the family was asking people going on holiday to put up the posters to further publicize the disappearance. He said he was grateful for the outpouring of solidarity. "One evil act seems to be generating so much good," he said. "Obviously we have very mixed emotions about being here, and of course why we are here," Gerry McCann said as he arrived in St. Peter's Square. "In normal circumstances it would be one of the most exciting things we could do in our own lifetimes, but very much on our minds is the fact that we are here without Madeleine." A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Ciro Benedettini, said British Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor had requested the McCanns' meeting with the pope. "We are talking about a family drama that has touched world public opinion. It could not but touch the Holy Father, especially since these people are Catholics," Benedettini said. "The Holy Father is considered the father of all, therefore he was personally touched as a father," the spokesman said. Madeleine McCann disappeared May 3 when her parents left her and her 2-year-old twin siblings alone in their hotel room while they went to a restaurant in their hotel complex in Praia da Luz, a resort town in Portugal's Algarve region. Gerry and Kate McCann have said they won't return to Britain without their daughter. Kate McCann is traveling with a pink stuffed animal - Cuddle Cat - that her daughter took to bed with her every night. "We have no plans to go back to the UK at the moment. I can't even think about that now, to be honest," she said.
