http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/ernst_taxshelters_dc Ernst & Young partners charged in tax fraud case & Young partners charged in tax fraud case PM ET NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Wednesday charged two current and two former partners of accounting firm Ernst & Young (ERNY.UL) with tax fraud conspiracy arising out of the sale of tax shelters. The defendants, who pleaded not guilty at U.S. District court in Manhattan, are accused of creating and marketing tax shelters at the "Big Four" accounting firm from 1998 through 2004 based on fraudulent scenarios that allowed wealthy individuals to reduce the federal taxes they would have to pay. The indictment comes after years of investigations into the sale of aggressive tax shelter strategies. Sixteen former partners at rival "Big Four" firm KPMG (KPMG.UL) are also facing trial in September. The four men accused on Wednesday include Robert Coplan, former National Director of Ernst & Young&#39;s Center for Family Wealth Planning; Martin Nissenbaum, the firm&#39;s former national director of Personal Income Tax and Retirement Planning; former Ernst & Young partner Richard Shapiro and Brian Vaughn, a former senior manager at the firm. A lawyer for Shapiro, John Tigue, said his client has cooperated with the government&#39;s inquiry for the last five years. "He intends to vigorously defend himself," Tigue said in a statement. At a hearing before U.S. District Judge Sidney Stein, Copland, Shapiro and Nissenbaum were released on &#36;1 million bail with travel restrictions, while Vaughn was released on &#36;300,000 bail with travel restrictions. If convicted of the charges, Coplan, 54, could face 18 years in prison; Nissenbaum, 51, could serve as many as 13 years, while Shapiro, 58, and Vaughn, 39, could each face 10. Defense lawyers maintained their clients were innocent. "We have provided them (the U.S. attorney&#39;s office) over the past year with evidence that Mr. Nissenbaum did not engage in any unlawful activity," Brian Linder, an attorney for Nissenbaum said in a statement. Vaughn&#39;s attorney, Peter Barrett, said his client "looks forward to trial in this case, to his acquittal, and complete exoneration of all of these allegations." A lawyer for Coplan would not comment. Prosecutors allege the four schemed to defraud U.S. tax authorities by deceiving the (IRS) about tax shelters marketed to clients with incomes higher than &#36;10 million or &#36;20 million. The indictment also charges that Coplan, Nissenbaum and Shapiro used tax shelters in 2000 to evade their own taxes and arranged for eight other Ernst & Young partners to participate, evading &#36;3.7 million in taxes. Ernst & Young was not named in the suit, suggesting a change in government strategy since the conviction of now- defunct accounting firm Arthur Andersen was overturned by the Supreme Court, a legal expert said. "The lesson the government has learned is to go for a precision strike against individuals," said Anthony Sabino, a law professor at St. John&#39;s University&#39;s Tobin College of Business. "You can&#39;t prove the whole firm is guilty." The attempted prosecution of the firm also lengthened the KPMG tax shelter case, Sabino said. In 2005, KPMG agreed to pay &#36;456 million, accept an outside monitor and admit to wrongdoing to resolve a federal investigation into questionable tax shelters it sold to wealthy individuals. But the settlement with the firm resulted in difficulties about who would pay the legal fees of KPMG&#39;s former partners in that case. Ernst & Young said it has made changes to its tax practice. "The individuals who were indicted are two former partners and two partners who have been on administrative leave," Ernst & Young spokesman Charles Perkins said in a statement. "They were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago ... Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation, and we will continue to do so." In July 2003, Ernst & Young agreed to pay &#36;15 million to the IRS to end an investigation of tax shelter marketing.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/odd_catholic_ultimatum Musician canned for focus on wrong organ canned for focus on wrong organ PM ET NEW FRANKEN, Wis. - A Catholic priest has removed his church's organist and choir director from her duties saying her sale of sex toys was not "consistent with Church teachings." Linette Servais, 50, played the organ and sung with the choir for 35 years. Much of her work as choir director and organist was done without pay. When her parish priest asked to meet with her, she thought it was to say thank you. Instead, she was told to quit her sales job with company known as Pure Romance or she would lose her position in the church. Pure Romance in Loveland, Ohio, is a $60 million per year business that sells spa products and sex toys at homes parties attended by women. It has 15,000 consultants like Servais. She said her decision was not hard: She began working with Pure Romance after a brain tumor and treatment left her sexually dysfunctional. The job allows her to help other women who have similar problems. "After I got over the initial shock, I prayed over this a long time," she said. "I feel that Pure Romance is my ministry." The Rev. Dean Dombroski felt differently, removing her from the choir loft just before Thanksgiving and gradually taking away other church duties. Servais can no longer take pictures during First Communion services or lead the committee planning St. Joseph's annual late-summer picnic. Dombroski said he couldn't discuss the situation because it involves personnel. But in a letter to his rural congregation, he wrote: "Linette is a consultant for a firm which sells products of a sexual nature that are not consistent with Church teachings. Because parish leaders are expected to model the teaching of our faith ... she could stay on as the choir director/organist or she could continue to be a consultant but she could not do both." Servais responded with her own three-page letter to church members, saying she felt compelled to help other women, especially those suffering from problems caused by cancer. Many choir members quit in support, she said, and some have gathered at her home on occasional Thursdays to sing hymns. "Father Dean made it sound so sinful," she said. "There is so much more to this business than toys."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/csm/aarmored Why so few bomb-safe US military trucks in Iraq? so few bomb-safe US military trucks in Iraq? By Gordon Lubold, Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor AM ET Washington - One senior officer calls it a "moral imperative," and others see it as a no-brainer, but four years into a deadly war, there are only some 350 blast-resistant trucks protecting US troops in . Officials inside and outside the military want to know why. When it comes to safeguarding troops against roadside bombs, the top killer in Iraq, the new must-have truck is an MRAP &#8211; a Mine Resistant, Ambush Protected vehicle. It&#39;s a hulking machine, at 31,000 pounds, with a &#39;V&#39;-shaped hull that diverts blasts away from the carriage &#8211; and the troops riding inside. No one has ever been killed riding in one version of the vehicle, called a Cougar. So why aren&#39;t thousands of the trucks, first available in 2003, in Iraq? "How is it possible that with our nation at war, with more than 130,000 Americans in danger, with roadside bombs destroying a growing number of lives and limbs, we were so slow to act to protect our troops?" asked Sen. Joseph Biden ( ) (D) of Delaware in a letter Tuesday to Defense Secretary Robert Gates. The answers to Senator Biden&#39;s question illustrate how hard it can be for the government &#8211; and the private sector &#8211; to respond to urgent battlefield needs while weighing legitimate concerns about how government contracts are awarded and production lines are cranked up. In the case of the MRAP, the process has been especially slow and tangled. In 2004, a year after the invasion of Iraq, the insurgency was mounting and roadside bombs were killing American troops. The conventional thinking about how to protect troops was to field "up-armored" Humvees. At the time, the insurgency didn&#39;t look as if it would go on much longer, so there was no need to invest in a new vehicle, and the Humvee already had an established industrial base. But the enemy was adapting, placing roadside bombs in such a way to cause blasts that ripped through the underside of vehicles, causing casualties. At the same time, a small company in South Carolina called Force Protection Inc. was pushing a different solution. It had designed a truck with a steel undercarriage shaped like a &#39;V,&#39; which diverted the force of blasts to the side of the vehicle. But the company and those who supported the initiative couldn&#39;t provide enough data to prove the effectiveness of the MRAP design. And even if it had had the data to make the case to the , the company was too small to mass-produce the vehicle. A year earlier, its 11-employee workforce had taken a month to produce just one truck. "In the beginning, we really weren&#39;t good enough to mass produce enough to be a good, mainstream solution," says Mike Aldrich, the company&#39;s vice-president of marketing and government relations. But Marines with the I Marine Expeditionary Force in Camp Pendleton, Calif., knew the design would save lives and made a request in February 2005 for more than 1,100 of the trucks. More than a year later, they made a second request. The Pentagon ultimately approved just 185 vehicles in mid-2006. Even as the Pentagon gears up to buy thousands more of the vehicles, Biden wants Secretary Gates to investigate the delay. The Pentagon wants 21,000 of the vehicles and Congress is paying for 7,700 of them. The company is now producing each month about 100 Cougars &#8211; the version most wanted by the military &#8211; and it&#39;s preparing to go to a 200-per-month production rate, hiring 25 new employees a week. Aldrich says his company can make 10,000 vehicles by December &#8211; but that&#39;s if he gets an order from the US government by July 1. "That will get a lot of people protected in a hurry," he says. "Now we&#39;re clearly putting the ball back in the government&#39;s court, we&#39;re saying &#39;place the order,&#39; " he says. But he declines to say how he can meet the surge in demand. At least eight other companies are also vying for MRAP contracts. The process by which the Pentagon awards contracts has long been slow. But the process moved quickly once the decision was made to move forward. While there was interest in the MRAP, it was hard for the services initially to make a "strategic decision" to buy thousands of them, says a Washington, D.C., attorney familiar with the MRAP contracting issue. If the military put all its acquisition eggs all in one basket and then found it didn&#39;t need the truck a year or so later, that would be seen as poor judgment at best and a boondoggle at worst. "The problem they had was more of strategy &#8211; where to you put your money, what makes the most sense &#8211; and not so much of the nuts and bolts of government acquisition," he says. "Once the decision was made at the strategic level to go with MRAP, they moved out pretty darn quick, warp speed." Marine Commandant Gen. James Conway says the Corps is pushing the envelope when it comes to working through &#8211; and if necessary, around &#8211; contracting regulations that can delay such purchases. "I could be wearing stripes [of enlisted men] when this is all over," General Conway joked during a Pentagon briefing recently, saying nevertheless that it is a "moral imperative" to get these vehicles to Iraq. Some question why there&#39;s all the fuss about a vehicle that will not have a big impact protecting forces until thousands more can be fielded next year and the year after &#8211; about the same time that many Americans believe the bulk of US forces will have left Iraq. That&#39;s not the way Aldrich sees it. As long as roadside bombs are effective, enemies of the US will use them wherever they may be, he says.

May is the third-worst month overall in the campaign for U.S. soldiers, behind November 2004, when 137 soldiers died, and April 2004, when 135 were killed. A total of 3,473 U.S. soldiers have been killed since the start of the invasion in March 2003. In the latest deaths, two soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb on Wednesday in southwestern Baghdad, the military said in a statement. Two more were wounded. Another soldier wounded by a roadside bomb in Baghdad&#39;s northwest on Monday died of his wounds on Tuesday. The U.S. military said another eight soldiers were wounded in a suicide car bomb attack at a checkpoint in the Sunni Arab enclave of Adamiya in northern Baghdad on Wednesday. Three Iraqi civilians, including a child, were also wounded. The U.S. military has said it expects to suffer greater casualties while it pours thousands of extra troops into Baghdad and other areas as part of a major security crackdown aimed at averting all-out sectarian civil war. Most U.S. soldiers are killed by roadside bombs. The U.S. military has accused of supplying particularly dangerous bombs called explosively formed penetrators, which can destroy an Abrams battle tank, to Shi&#39;ite militias.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/stem_cells Dems plan vote on stem cell research plan vote on stem cell research By DAVID ESPO, AP Special Correspondent PM ET WASHINGTON - Congress intends to send legislation next week to ease restrictions on federally funded embryonic stem cell research, inviting his second veto in as many years on the subject. As was the case last year, Bush appears likely to make his veto stick. Several Democratic officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that supporters of the bill appear to lack the two-thirds majority needed to override him. Rep. Diana DeGette ( ), D-Colo., a leading advocate of the legislation, did not dispute that assessment in an interview. "If he does veto it again it will just show his complete unwillingness to look at this research that holds the potential for cure of these diseases," she said. Both houses passed legislation on the subject earlier in the year. The final vote is expected Thursday in the House. Public opinion polls show strong support for the research, and it could return as an issue in the 2008 elections. Supporters of the research say it holds great promise in the quest for treatments of Alzheimer's and other illnesses. Critics counter that it is immoral because it involves the destruction of human embryos. In threatening a veto this year Bush said it "crossed a moral line that I and many others find troubling." There was no federal money for the work until Bush announced on Aug. 9, 2001, that his administration would make it available for lines of stem cells that were in existence. Elected with the strong support of abortion foes and other conservatives, he said at the time his decision was designed to balance concerns about "protecting life and improving life." He also limited the funds to cell lines derived from embryos that were surplus at fertility clinics, and that had been donated from adults who had given informed consent. Bush vetoed legislation to allow funding of additional lines of embryonic stem cells last year when it passed over the objections of Republicans then in control. Democrats made the legislation a top priority when they took control of the House and Senate in January. The House approved an initial measure within days of convening on a 253-174 vote was short of a veto-proof majority. The Senate passed a slightly different measure in April, 63-34, a margin that suggested supporters were one vote short of two-thirds. DeGette said the change inserted into the bill in the Senate encourages the federal government to conduct research into alternative therapies.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/afghan_helicopter_dc NATO says hostile fire may have caused crash says hostile fire may have caused crash AM ET said on Thursday Taliban fire may have brought down its military helicopter in which the alliance said seven soldiers were killed. The Taliban said 35 people died. Hours after the crash and backed by air power, a joint NATO and Afghan raid killed and wounded dozens of Taliban in Sangin district, close to Kajaki where the twin-rotor NATO helicopter crashed on Wednesday night, the Afghan defense ministry said. The Chinook crashed in the southern province of Helmand, scene of a series of bloody fights between Taliban and Western forces in recent months and a long-time bastion of the Taliban. "It was a hostile area where the helicopter went down," Major John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO in Afghanistan, told Reuters. "And initial indications are that enemy fire may have brought down the helicopter." Taliban spokesman Qari Mohammad Yousuf said the death toll of 35 came from secret sources operating in Helmand. Taliban claims on foreign deaths are often exaggerated. He said the helicopter was flying low ahead of a land vehicle convoy when it was shot down. "Actually, mujahideen (holy warriors) planned to ambush their convoy," Yousuf said by telephone from an undisclosed location. "But the helicopter appeared before the arrival of the convoy. The mujahideen fired on it with whatever they had." NATO said seven soldiers, five of whom were Americans, were killed when the Chinook crashed in Helmand, and called the Taliban claim "absurd." A Chinook can carry 28 combat-loaded troops, a U.S. military official said. At least 55 U.S. soldiers have been killed in five previous Chinook crashes in Afghanistan in the past two years. Helmand has long been a Taliban stronghold and it is the leading drug-producing region of Afghanistan, the world&#39;s main heroin producer. The Chinook came down in the Kajaki region where the Afghan government is seeking to tighten security in order to rebuild a dam and hydro-electric project. Taliban leaders have threatened in recent weeks to step up attacks on foreign troops and said they have trained hundreds of suicide bombers to carry out attacks. Last year&#39;s fighting between Western forces and the militants was the bloodiest since the U.S.-led overthrow of the Taliban in 2001. The guerrillas are largely active in southern and eastern areas of Afghanistan, where more than 5,000 people have been killed in the past 16 months. The violence is rising despite the presence of nearly 50,000 foreign troops led by NATO and the U.S. military as well as about 100,000 Afghan security forces.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/mideasthistory67warusdiplomacy The war that still shadows US diplomacy in Middle East war that still shadows US diplomacy in Middle East PM ET WASHINGTON (AFP) - The six-day Middle East war fought 40 years ago still haunts US diplomacy, with Washington uneasily navigating between its staunch support for and a desire to build bridges to the Arab world. Facing above all the need to pacify , the US government today has been reaching out to regional Arab powers like Egypt, but is constrained by the popular view that it is an unquestioning ally of Israel. "The (Arab) public still looks at the US and the world largely through the prism of the Arab-Israeli issue," commented Shibley Telhami, a Middle East expert at Washington&#39;s Brookings Institution. In October 1967, four months after the decisive Israeli victory over the armed forces of Egypt, Jordan and , the US administration of president Lyndon Johnson began a massive program of arms supplies to the Jewish state. Declared US policy beforehand had been to stay even-handed, with an isolated Israel surrounded by hostile Arab powers and masses of Palestinian refugees clamoring to return to their pre-1948 lands. The United States had sold a batch of missiles to Israel in 1962 but three years later, deputy defense secretary Peter Solbert wrote: "In no case, however, will the US contribute to providing one state in the area a military advantage against another." All that changed after the Six-Day War as the United States stepped in to become Israel&#39;s leading military supplier in place of France, which as a result of the conflict imposed an arms embargo on the Jewish state. The United States was motivated also by the Cold War need to counter hefty arms supplies by the Soviet Union to Egypt and Syria. From less than 50 million dollars before 1967, US military aid to Israel now stands at more than three billion dollars a year. On several occasions, Washington has tried to balance its military support by acting as an "honest broker" in Middle East peace efforts, notably in the 1978 Camp David accords between Israel and Egypt and the Oslo accords of 1993. But Scott Lasensky, senior researcher at the United States Institute For Peace, said: "In the most recent period, the US has been surprisingly absent from Arab-Israeli peace making. "It&#39;s shocking that 40 years have passed and yet the US and the international community as well has not put forward a specific vision for what a two-state solution could look like," he said. During the war of June 5-June 10, 1967, Israel captured the and the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, the and east Jerusalem from Jordan and the Golan Heights from Syria. Israel handed Sinai back to Egypt as part of the Camp David peace treaty, but has retained the rest in defiance of a UN Security Council resolution adopted by the United States and other major powers in November 1967. The celebrated resolution 242 called for Israeli forces to withdraw "from territories occupied in the recent conflict" and for Arab non-aggression against the Jewish state as the basis of a lasting peace. That "land for peace" formula remains the bedrock of peace initiatives today, and still provides an opening if administration were serious about mediation, Telhami said. In polls of Arab public opinion, the desire remains for the United States to take a decisive role in pushing the Palestinians and Israelis to a comprehensive peace deal that would encompass all regional powers. "You can see that by far the number-one answer is brokering Arab-Israeli peace based on the 1967 borders. By far that is the issue that they see as most important (for US policy)," Telhami said. wants probe of high gas prices Cease-fire eyed to stop violence in holds line on Iran nuclear program moves toward White House bid Bush asks for global emission goals by 2008 AP minutes ago CNN minutes ago Stephanopoulos on Fred Thompson AM ET Raw Politics: Watchdogs barking CNN AM ET Quit Your Job Take classes online and earn your degree in one year.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/turkey_northern_iraq Turkish general: Ready for PKK strike general: Ready for PKK strike By SELCAN HACAOGLU, Associated Press Writer AM ET ANKARA, Turkey - Turkey's top general said Thursday the military was ready to stage a cross-border offensive to fight Kurdish guerrillas in and that he already had sought government approval to mount military action. Earlier Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has pledged his support for any military decision to stage an incursion into Iraq, said the army had not yet asked parliament for permission. But Gen. Yasar Buyukanit said he had asked for approval during a news conference on April 12, when he said "an operation into Iraq is necessary." "We have told both Turkey and the world on April 12 that as soldiers, we are ready," Buyukanit said Thursday. Buyukanit's remarks appeared to put Erdogan's government under pressure to seek approval from parliament to send soldiers into Iraq to fight separatist Kurdish guerrillas. The rebels have long used northern Iraq as a base in their campaign for self-rule in southeast Turkey. The United States opposes any unilateral Turkish military action, fearing it could destabilize northern Iraq &#151; the calmest part of the country. Massoud Barzani, the leader of the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq, also strongly opposes a Turkish incursion and has threatened to confront Turkish soldiers if they enter northern Iraq. Military trucks hauled more tanks and guns to the border area Thursday, local reporters said. For weeks, TV stations have broadcast images of military trucks rumbling along the remote border, and trains transferring tanks and guns to bolster an already formidable force in the area. The U.S. State Department said Wednesday that it has seen nothing to substantiate reports of a significant movement of Turkish military forces to the border. Buyukanit said the government needed to define the political targets of such an operation, referring to Barzani. "Political authorities will determine the targets," Buyukanit said. "Are we going to struggle with the PKK once we enter there or do something with Barzani too?" he said, referring to the main Kurdish separatist group. Turkey fears Iraqi Kurds could establish a Kurdish state that would inspire the rebels and revive the fighting. Turkey also is concerned that Iraqi Kurds' efforts to incorporate the oil center of Kirkuk into their self-governing region in northern Iraq could embolden the rebels. Buyukanit complained about what he said was a lack of help from allies in fighting the Kurds. "It is obvious that Turkey does not receive the necessary support in its fight against terrorism," Buyukanit said at an international security conference in Istanbul. Earlier this week, Erdogan urged the United States and Iraq to destroy PKK bases in northern Iraq. And the military has said Europe was not doing enough to limit the activities of fundraisers and other PKK sympathizers. Past cross-border operations have yielded mixed results, with many guerrillas sheltering in hide-outs and emerging to fight again once the bulk of Turkish units withdrew from Iraq. A government official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not authorized to address the media, said the military could set up a buffer zone in northern Iraq to block Kurdish rebels from entering Turkey. Turkey set up such a zone along the 200-mile border in 1997 but gradually withdrew the bulk of its troops under international pressure, leaving about 1,000 inside Iraq. Those troops act as monitors, but have not pursued the rebels. "To set up a buffer zone, Turkey needs to secure the consent of both Washington and the Iraqi Kurds," said Nihat Ali Ozcan of the Economic Policy Research Institute in Ankara. "However, the military buildup clearly puts more pressure on U.S. and Iraqi forces to do something quickly." Turkish intelligence reports said Iraqi Kurdish groups were preparing defenses on their side of the border, apparently in case of any Turkish incursion. The Turkish military says up to 3,800 rebels are now based in Iraq, and up to 2,300 operate inside Turkey. Turkish troops, reinforced by planes and helicopter gunships, have killed 14 PKK guerrillas in operations near the border since Monday. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of troops since the guerrillas launched a war for autonomy in the Kurdish-dominated southeast in 1984.

In an interview with Italian newspaper La Repubblica, Nobel economics prize winner Joseph Stiglitz said outgoing President Paul Wolfowitz&#39;s tenure had been a "disaster" and questioned his successor&#39;s ability to end protectionism. "Robert Zoellick defended American agricultural protectionism until the bitter end when he was responsible for commercial talks," Stiglitz said. "How will he, as the future president of the World Bank, ask for the dismantling of aid to agriculture that favors developed countries at the expense of those that are poor?" Zoellick, former U.S. Trade representative, was picked by head the World Bank after Wolfowitz agreed to step down in a furor over a promotion and pay rise he authorized for his companion, Middle East expert Shaha Riza. Stiglitz also attacked European countries for being "complicit" in the World Bank&#39;s present situation. "They preferred to support a system of sharing that guarantees their presidency of the , instead of changing the selection criteria with courage," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/macworld/jobsgates20070530 Live Coverage: Jobs and Gates joint appearance Coverage: Jobs and Gates joint appearance Jason Snell and Peter Cohen - Macworld AM ET Our live coverage of the joint appearance by at the D: All Things Digital conference has concluded. In what was certainly the marquee event at this year&#8217;s D: All Things Digital conference, an annual gathering coordinated by the , Steve Jobs shared the stage with Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates in a joint appearance discussing the technology industry&#8217;s past while looking ahead to its future. The evening began with history repeating itself in the form of videos originally recorded in 1984, 1991 and 1997, in which the two men shared a stage. The video ended with Jobs and Gates entering from opposite ends of the D: All Things Digital stage. technology columnist Kara Swisher and Walt Mossberg. Swisher started by asked the two men what each has contributed to their industry. &#8220;Bill built the first software company in the industry. And I think he built the first software company before anyone in our industry knew what a software company was, and that was huge. And the business model they ended up pursuing ended up working really well,&#8221; said Jobs. &#8220;Bill was focused on software before anyone else had a clue. There&#8217;s a lot more you can say, but that&#8217;s the high-order bit.&#8221; &#8220;First I want to clarify, I&#8217;m not Fake Steve Jobs,&#8221; said Gates, to peals of laughter from the audience. The good old days &#8220;What Steve&#8217;s done is phenomenal,&#8221; Gates continued. &#8220;Back in 1977, the Apple II, the idea that it would be a mass market machine and an incredibly empowering phenomenon. And the , that was so risky. Apple really bet the company, Lisa hadn&#8217;t done that well, but the team that Steve built within the company to pursue that, some days it felt a little ahead of its time, remember the Twiggy disk drive and&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;In a certain sense we build the products we want to use ourselves. He&#8217;s really pursued that with an incredible taste and elegance and had a huge impact on the industry. Apple literally was failing when Steve went back and reinfused innovation and risk-taking that have been phenomenal. So the industry has benefitted immensely from his work. I&#8217;d say he&#8217;s contributed as much as anyone,&#8221; said Gates. Jobs called Gates and himself &#8220;incredibly lucky&#8221; to attract great partners and great people to work with. He agreed with Mossberg&#8217;s assessment that in a sense, he and Gates are standing in for all the people at both their companies. Jobs ruefully recalled some of Apple&#8217;s early television advertisements. &#8220;We had a kitchen, with the wife typing in recipes and the husband looking on approvingly,&#8221; he said, to laughter from the audience. Jobs and Gates also recalled Microsoft&#8217;s efforts to provide floating point computation in the Apple II&#8217;s BASIC programming language. &#8220;My partner, Steve Wozniak, brilliant guy. Writes the best BASIC on the planet. Perfect in every way, except for one thing: it&#8217;s just fixed point, not floating point. So we&#8217;re getting a lot of input, please make it floating point. I&#8217;m begging Woz, and he just doesn&#8217;t do it. He wrote it down on paper, never got around to doing it. So Microsoft had this very popular, very good floating point BASIC. And we went to them,&#8221; said Jobs. Gates picked up the story from there. &#8220;It was $31,000 for the floating point BASIC. And I went down to Apple getting the cassette tapes to work,&#8221; he added. Gates and Jobs both agreed that Microsoft made a huge bet with the Macintosh when Apple first introduced the new computer. &#8220;What&#8217;s hard to remember now, is that Microsoft wasn&#8217;t in the applications business then,&#8221; said Jobs. &#8220;We made this bet that this paradigm shift would happen, to graphical interfaces, and that the Mac would be the one to do it,&#8221; said Gates. &#8220;The big bet wasn&#8217;t Mac versus Windows, it was character-mode versus graphics interface.&#8221; Gates added that Microsoft eventually saw the benefits of that bet come home to roost when PC-compatible computers were outfitted with 386-era micprocessors. The bad old days Jobs recalls 1997, the year he returned to Apple computer after a decade running Next. &#8220;Apple was in very serious trouble. and what was clear, where if the game was a zero-sum game, where for Apple to win Microsoft had to lose, and if that was the case, Apple would lose,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lot of people&#8217;s heads were in that place &#8230; There were too many people at Apple playing [that] game. It was clear that you didn&#8217;t have to play that game.&#8221; &#8220;Apple had to remember who Apple was, because it had forgotten,&#8221; he said. Jobs&#8217; decision was to call Bill up. &#8220;And we tried to patch things up.&#8221; Gates said that since then, Microsoft has had a dedicated Macintosh application development group &#8212; the Mac Business Unit, or MacBU, which works very closely with Apple. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great business for us,&#8221; he said. A good natured rivalry? Gates and Jobs also traded comments about the Mac vs. PC television advertisements that pit actors John Hodgman and Justin Long against each other, as anthropomorphic Windows PC and Mac, respectively. Jobs said the art of those advertisements is not to be mean, but for the guys to like each other. &#8220;His mother loves him,&#8221; said Gates, ruefully, about the PC character. &#8220;PC Guy is what makes it all work,&#8221; added Jobs, but Gates seemed unconvinced. Mossberg noted that Apple and Microsoft continue to vie for the hearts and minds of consumers &#8212; recently with the Zune, Microsoft&#8217;s iPod competitor, and Vista, Microsoft&#8217;s new operating system that has been pitted against Mac in numerous head-to-head comparisons in magazines and tech Web sites. Jobs reiterated a point he made with Mossberg during his interview earlier in the day: The iPod, said Jobs, is a response to the development of digital music players by Japanese consumer electronics makers, who, in Jobs&#8217; opinion could create great boxes but not develop good software to manage them. The iPod and the Mac are both principally differentiated from their competitors by the software that drives them. &#8220;So the big secret about Apple is that Apple views itself as a software company. And there aren&#8217;t very many software companies left. And Microsoft is a software company,&#8221; said Jobs. &#8220;We look at what they do, and some is really great, and some is competitive, and some of it&#8217;s not.&#8221; Apple&#8217;s goal is much more modest than world domination, said Jobs. &#8220;We don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re going to have 80 percent of the market,&#8221; he said, doubtlessly disappointing legions of Mac enthusiasts. &#8220;We&#8217;re happy when our market share goes up a point.&#8221; The future of computing Jobs cited Apple alumnus Alan Kay next, and illustrated a key difference between himself and his colleague and rival. &#8220;Alan Kay said, people who love software want to do their own hardware,&#8221; said Jobs. &#8220;I can resist that,&#8221; retorted Gates. Jobs waxed philosophical. &#8220;In the consumer market at least, I think one can make a pretty strong case that outside of Windows on PCs, it&#8217;s hard to see other examples of the software and hardware being decoupled working super well yet,&#8221; said Jobs. &#8220;It might in the phone space over time, it might, but it&#8217;s not clear.&#8221; Gates believes the future of computing is what he describes as &#8220;rich local functionality.&#8221; He points to single-function computers and network computers as examples of devices that didn&#8217;t sell as well as the industry expected. &#8220;It&#8217;s using local richness together with richness elsewhere,&#8221; he added. Jobs agrees with Gates, and provided what he believes is a practical example of Apple&#8217;s innovation at work when it comes to providing users with a rich local experience combined with remote data: the Google Maps functionality embedded on Apple&#8217;s forthcoming iPhone, which ships in late June. &#8220;The experience is unbelievable, way better than a computer. And that client app is the result of a lot of technology on the client. And you can&#8217;t do that stuff in a browser,&#8221; said Jobs. Gates opined that in five years&#8217; time, consumers won&#8217;t depend on a single computer &#8212; they&#8217;ll have multiple devices, such as a tablet with &#8220;voice and ink,&#8221; along with &#8220;a phone, a pocket-sized device.&#8221; Jobs sees a history for the same computer we&#8217;ve grown accustomed to. &#8220;As Bill said earlier, the death of the PC has been repeatedly predicted,&#8221; he said. The PC will continue to be with us and will evolve, Jobs added. Jobs forsees &#8220;an explosion&#8221; of what he describes as &#8220;post-PC devices&#8221; such as the iPod. &#8220;There&#8217;s a category of devices that aren&#8217;t as general-purpose,&#8221; he said, &#8220;And that category is going to continue to be very innovative. And we&#8217;re going to see lots of them.&#8221; Jobs said that those &#8220;Post-PC devices&#8221; are very attractive because they represent &#8220;a clean slate&#8221; that lacks the legacy of many applications and are more focused. &#8220;But you have to temper it, because you have users who don&#8217;t want a car with six wheels,&#8221; he said. The oldest guys in the room Asked by Kara Swisher to define the greatest misunderstanding in their relationship, Jobs joked, &#8220;We&#8217;ve kept our marriage secret for over a decade now.&#8221; &#8220;We did look a lot younger in that video,&#8221; Gates ruminated. He added that many of the people both Gates and Jobs worked with in the early days have moved on to other things. &#8220;I actually kind of miss some of the people who aren&#8217;t around anymore,&#8221; he said. Jobs explained that when they started out, he and Gates were often the youngest guys in the room. Now they&#8217;re often the oldest. &#8220;I say everything in life is like a Beatles song or a Bob Dylan song. But there&#8217;s that one line in that one Beatles song, &#8216;You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead.&#8217; And that clearly is true here.&#8221; Following Swisher and Mossberg&#8217;s questions, the audience was given an opportunity to ask the two captains of the computer industry their own questions. Queries ran the gamut from politics to entrepreneurialism. Gates said that his life&#8217;s work &#8212; development of the personal computer &#8212; led him to want to create his charitable foundation to benefit people &#8220;who haven&#8217;t had technology, including medicine, working for them.&#8221; Jobs said he&#8217;s unconcerned with his own legacy, calling himself and Gates &#8220;the two luckiest guys on the planet.&#8221; &#8220;I just think about going in every day and being around these great people,&#8221; he said. Asked to give advice for others considering starting their own businesses, Gates explained that in the early days, he and his colleagues never considered the value of the company they were developing. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about the people and the passion, and it&#8217;s amazing the business worked out the way it did.&#8221; Is there anything that one envies about the other, Gates cited Jobs&#8217; &#8220;intuitive taste, both for people and products.&#8221; As for Jobs, he said that he wished he and Apple cofounder Steve Wozniak learned earlier how to partner with others, as Microsoft had. &#8220;If Apple had more of that in its DNA, it would have served it really well. And it didn&#8217;t learn that until a couple decades later.&#8221; Chip sales expected to grow by 2.5 pct.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/schwarzenegger_stemcell_dc Schwarzenegger, Ontario premier in stem cell deal Ontario premier in stem cell deal PM ET TORONTO (Reuters) - Ontario and California will work together to develop new stem cell therapies to help conquer cancer, and will cooperate on curbing greenhouse gas emission, the leaders of the two regions said on Wednesday. Flanked by California Governor , Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty pledged C&#36;30 million (&#36;28 million) for a Cancer Stem Cell Consortium at a Toronto research center. "Californian and Ontarian researchers pioneered the discovery of cancer stem cells which are at the root of many cancers," McGuinty told a packed house at the facility, just steps away from some of Canada&#39;s top hospitals. "The cancer stem cell consortium will research ways to use this knowledge of cancer stem cells to find a lasting cure for cancer." Under the program, scientists in Ontario will work closely with researchers in California. "With all these brilliant minds and great commitments that we have here in Canada and California, we are leading the world in stem cell research," said Schwarzenegger, who has butted heads with his efforts to bring stem cell research to the forefront. "We are as powerful as any one can ever be on stem cell research. I am looking forward for all of us working together and to cure all of those illnesses as quickly as possible." Stem cells are a kind of master cell for the body, capable of growing into various types of cell or tissue and cell. Scientists hope to use the cells to repair tissue damaged by disease or injury. The two leaders also signed an agreement to co-ordinate policies to reduce greenhouse gases from vehicles. "Like California, Ontario is leading the way in recognizing that we must take action now to fight global warming and to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels," Schwarzenegger said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/gop_ethics GOP fear fallout from new ethics probes fear fallout from new ethics probes By CHARLES BABINGTON, Associated Press Writer PM ET WASHINGTON - A half dozen federal investigations into the activities of Republican lawmakers are raising new worries for GOP leaders who hope to regain the House majority they lost last fall. In recent weeks, two veteran Republicans surrendered prominent committee seats after agents raided the offices of family businesses. Others have long-running investigations hanging over them. Some conservative activists are criticizing the party's handling of the matters. Democrats say at least six GOP House members are under some degree of Justice Department scrutiny, although Republicans question whether all the inquiries are active. In pure numbers, Republicans are approaching the magnitude of their problem at this stage of the 2006 election cycle. Eventually, nine House Republicans faced FBI investigations. Four stepped down, and two &#151; Reps. Randy "Duke" Cunningham of California and Bob Ney of Ohio &#151; are in prison. Of the five who sought re-election, three lost and the other two remain under ethical clouds. Republicans call attention to the fact that Democrats have their own ethical problems. Two House Democrats are the focus of federal investigations. Rep. William J. Jefferson, D-La., has been under scrutiny in a bribery investigation since at least 2005, when FBI agents found $90,000 in his home freezer. The Justice Department also is investigating whether Rep. Alan Mollohan ( ), D-W.Va., benefited from steering federal funds to nonprofit groups he helped start. Both Jefferson and Mollohan easily won re-election last year. Republicans say Democrats will have trouble duplicating the success of last year's "culture of corruption" campaign theme because the current allegations against GOP members are far less severe. There is no evidence of the type of overt corruption that felled Cunningham and Ney, they say, and no one under scrutiny has the national name recognition that former Majority Leader , R-Texas, had in 2005 and 2006. At a minimum, however, the growing list of GOP incumbents under scrutiny is a distraction and nuisance for a party already struggling with an unpopular president and his handling of an unpopular war. "It's a question of accountability," said Jennifer Crider, spokeswoman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which has numerous researchers digging into GOP members' records. Ethics cases elsewhere aren't helping Republicans. Democrats are using subpoenas to dig into the administration's firing of several federal prosecutors. They're also monitoring news reports from Alaska saying that business associates, friends and a son of veteran GOP Sen. Ted Stevens ( ) are under investigation in a long-running corruption probe. The situation troubles some conservative activists. Especially under criticism is the House GOP leaders' decision to replace one embattled member of the coveted Appropriations Committee with another. Rep. John Doolittle ( ), R-Calif., left the committee in April after FBI agents raided his Washington-area home. His wife, Julie, ran a business from the home in which she received commissions as a paid fundraiser for her husband's campaigns and her clients included now-jailed GOP lobbyist Jack Abramoff. Doolittle's committee seat went to Rep. Ken Calvert ( ), R-Calif. The FBI retrieved copies of Calvert's annual financial disclosure statements following reports last year that Calvert steered millions of federal dollars to projects near his private real estate developments. Calvert says the FBI has not contacted him and he has no reason to believe he is a target. But that hasn't stopped the widely read conservative blog RedState.com from repeatedly denouncing Calvert's appointment to the Appropriations Committee. Joining the attack recently was Family Research Council President Tony Perkins. He said Calvert "would seem to fit in more with the party" that keeps Jefferson and Mollohan in office "than with a party that has made great strides in trying to clean up its image." Aside from Doolittle, Republican operatives are most concerned about Rep. Rick Renzi ( ), R-Ariz., who gave up his House intelligence committee seat last month after FBI agents raided his wife's insurance business. Renzi paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes while settling charges that his businesses improperly paid for his first congressional campaign. He also faces an inquiry into whether he used his House seat to help a former business partner make land swaps. Other Republican House members recently under federal scrutiny include: _Jerry Lewis of California: Prosecutors in Los Angeles are examining how millions of dollars in federal contracts were steered to a company whose founders were big contributors to Lewis' campaigns while he chaired the House Appropriations Committee. _Tim Murphy of Pennsylvania: Murphy declined comment on published reports that authorities are investigating whether his legislative aides performed campaign work while on government time. _Gary Miller of California: Miller says he has no reason to believe he is under investigation, but Democrats have run Web-based attack ads citing published reports that federal agents have looked into some land deals involving the lawmaker. Jessica Boulanger, spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said Democratic attacks on the ethics front will have little effect. Democrats, she said, "are proving incapable of governing, so it's no wonder they're dusting off their '06 playbook in an effort to hide their failed leadership." wants probe of high gas prices Cease-fire eyed to stop violence in holds line on Iran nuclear program moves toward White House bid Bush asks for global emission goals by 2008 AP minutes ago CNN minutes ago Stephanopoulos on Fred Thompson AM ET Raw Politics: Watchdogs barking CNN AM ET Quit Your Job Take classes online and earn your degree in one year.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/g8germany US-Russia clashes sour G8 meeting clashes sour G8 meeting AM ET POTSDAM, Germany (AFP) - A clash between the United States and Russia over a proposed missile shield overshadowed a meeting of G8 foreign ministers Wednesday also marred by differences over climate change and The meeting here to thrash out the agenda for a summit of G8 leaders in Germany next week ended on a sour note after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State exchanged sharp words over Washington&#39;s plans to base parts of a missile defence shield in eastern Europe. Although both sides welcomed the announcement that Russian President rare face-to-face talks in Maine on July 1-2, the strains were clear. Lavrov reacted angrily to comments Rice made Tuesday that Russian concerns over the shield were "ludicrous" and he accused Washington of reviving Cold War-era tensions. "I think that those who are professionally aware of this problem understand that there is nothing ludicrous about this issue because the arms race is starting again," Lavrov told reporters after the meeting. The United States says the planned radar base in the Czech Republic and 10 interceptor missiles in neighbouring Poland would defend Europe against potential threats from , but Russia argues the shield threatens its security. In a terse response to Lavrov, Rice said: "The idea is that this particular missile defence programme cannot and is not expected to be able to somehow degrade the Russian nuclear deterrent." She said Russia&#39;s nuclear arsenal "would overwhelm quite easily anything that is anticipated now or in the future for American and European missile defence." Lavrov and Rice were also sharply at odds over the future status of Kosovo. The Russian minister stressed that Moscow remained totally opposed to recommendations from chief UN negotiator Martti Ahtisaari that the UN Security Council should grant Kosovo internationally supervised independence from Serbia, a traditional Russian ally. Lavrov said he hoped Russia would not have to use its Security Council veto to block a resolution on the province. "I hope a veto will not be necessary," he said. Rice said the Western powers were united in their support for the plan and would not accept Kosovo being reincorporated into Serbia. "We and several of my European colleagues here believe that the Ahtisaari report provides the right basis for resolving the issue of status for Kosovo," she said. Kosovo has been under UN control since 1999, after a bombing campaign helped to force the withdrawal of Serb forces carrying out a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanians. Lavrov and Rice crossed swords again later at a meeting of the so-called diplomatic Quartet working to bring about peace in the Middle East, with the Russian minister warning that a sharp increase in US military aid earmarked for Lebanon could "destabilise" the country. Rice retorted that Washington was complying with a UN Secretary Council resolution calling for reinforcement of the Lebanese army with the aid boost, which was approved by Congress last week. Although global warming was not officially on the talks&#39; agenda, divisions at the meeting indicated it was unlikely that the G8 summit in Heiligendamm on June 6-8 will produce any binding agreement on limiting greenhouse gases. Chancellor Angela Merkel has staked Germany&#39;s presidency of the G8 on reaching a binding agreement between the leading industrial powers on limiting harmful carbon emissions -- a prospect Washington has rejected out of hand. Rice said countries like Germany, which prides itself on its green credentials, should respect the US strategy of seeking a technological approach to reducing greenhouse gases. G8 member Japan underlined in Potsdam that it believed a German-proposed deadline to conclude negotiations on the successor to the Kyoto Protocol by the end of 2009 were "premature." Amid the discord, all eight nations presented a united front on Iran&#39;s nuclear ambitions. A joint statement said the G8 was prepared to back "appropriate measures" if the Islamic republic failed to halt uranium enrichment. Iran says it is solely trying to produce nuclear energy, but Washington believes it is trying to develop atomic weapons. The foreign ministers of and Pakistan were invited to the Potsdam meeting and backed a G8 initiative, underlining "their common interest in working together to promote peace, security and development in the region." The G8 summit will be attended by the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States. The White House said Wednesday that US French President Nicolas Sarkozy will hold their first formal talks next week on the sidelines of the G8 summit. "The president looks forward to meeting President Sarkozy on the margins of the G8 in Germany next week," said US national security council spokesman Gordon Johndroe, who did not give a precise date. It will be their first bilateral meeting since Sarkozy took office earlier this month. wants probe of high gas prices Cease-fire eyed to stop violence in holds line on Iran nuclear program moves toward White House bid Bush asks for global emission goals by 2008 AP minutes ago CNN minutes ago Stephanopoulos on Fred Thompson AM ET Raw Politics: Watchdogs barking CNN AM ET with Bad Credit refinance requests only.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/afghanistanunrest Taliban attack kills 16 Afghan policemen attack kills 16 Afghan policemen AM ET KABUL (AFP) - A Taliban ambush killed 16 policemen in -led force said a chopper that came down in the south, killing seven foreign soldiers, may have been struck by hostile fire. Afghan officials announced meanwhile that at least a dozen Taliban fighters lost their lives in incidents overnight, and bombing raids in the southern province of Helmand were believed to have killed and wounded several more. The attack on the police was one of the deadliest on the fledgling force, which is regularly hit by ambushes and roadside bombs in an insurgency led by the extremist Taliban movement that was driven from government in 2001. A three-vehicle police convoy was on its way from the south to the capital, Kabul, when it was ambushed along the main highway -- one of the busiest in the country, the interior ministry said. "Sixteen police were martyred and another six police were wounded today at 8:30 am in an ambush by the enemies of peace in Afghanistan," spokesman Zemarai Bashary told AFP. There were also casualties on the Taliban side, Bashary said, without giving a number. NATO&#39;s International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said in Kabul meanwhile that a Chinook that came down in Helmand late Wednesday may have been hit by hostile fire. The Taliban movement said its men shot down the chopper. "We are able to say now that there may have been enemy fire in bringing down the helicopter," the ISAF media office in Kabul said. "It could be anything from small arms fire upwards." The 37-nation force does not release the nationalities of its casualties, but the Ministry of Defence announced in London that one of the seven dead was a British soldier. The icasualties.org website, which charts casualties in the operations in Afghanistan and , said five of the dead were US nationals, but this was not confirmed by the US military here. Taliban spokesman Yousuf Ahmadi said late Wednesday that "our brothers in Helmand" had brought down the heavy transport helicopter. "The helicopter burst into flames in the sky and then crashed," he said, citing the local rebel cell that claimed to have to carried out the attack. The insurgents have made similar claims in the past but are only confirmed to have brought down one military aircraft in Afghanistan -- in June 2005 when a rocket-propelled grenade shot down a Chinook in Kunar province. All 16 soldiers on board, eight of them US Navy SEALs, were killed. The defence ministry said meanwhile that Afghan and ISAF soldiers became involved in heavy fighting in Helmand early Thursday. "Tens of enemy elements have been killed and wounded," it said in a statement. "Various enemy locations were bombed by the air forces and the operation is still ongoing." Hardcore Taliban are said to be allied with drugs barons and foreign fighters in Helmand, the top producer of Afghanistan&#39;s illegal opium. The province is where the Afghan and foreign military forces said they killed the Taliban&#39;s top military commander, Mullah Dadullah, this month in the military&#39;s biggest success against the movement. The rebels have vowed to avenge the commander&#39;s death. Separately the district centre in western Farah province, which is on the Iranian border, came under "heavy attack by enemies of peace and sovereignty" overnight, the interior ministry said Thursday. Police returned fire, killing 10 rebels and injuring 15, it said. And in the southern province of Kandahar, two Taliban insurgents fell victim to one of their own bombs when the device exploded as they were planting it, Panjwayi district governor Niaz Mohammad Sarhadi said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/iraq Iraq&#39;s bloodiest month for US troops since Fallujah invasion bloodiest month for US troops since Fallujah invasion 1 hour, 47 minutes ago BAGHDAD (AFP) - Six more US soldiers have been killed in , the military announced on Thursday, confirming that May has become the deadliest month for American forces in two-and-a-half years. Meanwhile, the hunt intensified for five Britons who were snatched at gunpoint from a finance ministry building in the capital earlier this week, in an abduction that has been blamed on Baghdad&#39;s Shiite militias. US forces detained two suspects in a raid on Sadr City, the eastern Baghdad bastion of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr&#39;s Mahdi Army, but it was not clear whether this operation was linked to the missing Britons. The raids come one day after the US military arrested a Mahdi Army commander in Kadhimiyah, a northern Shiite district in Baghdad, according to a US statement released Thursday. The man was accused of "managing operations to murder and intimidate local Iraqis and ordering several attacks on coalition forces," and of training militants in the use of armour-piercing roadside bombs, the statement said. Two US soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb on Wednesday in the southwest corner of the capital, a ward of battered neighbourhoods that has seen intense fighting recently. A separate blast that day killed two others on foot patrol. Another soldier was killed earlier this week by a roadside blast northwest of the capital, and a US soldier died of "non-battle related causes," the military also announced on Thursday. The latest deaths bring US casualties for the month to 119, the most since November 2004 when marines launched a full-scale invasion to retake the city of Fallujah in the volatile western Anbar province. Unlike in Fallujah, US forces have fought no major set-piece encounters in May, but instead have been fanning out through Baghdad and a belt of flashpoint towns around the capital in a bid to quell sectarian violence. "First and foremost, it&#39;s been a tough month," Brigadier General Perry Wiggins, deputy director of regional operations with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters at a Defence Department briefing on Wednesday. "We&#39;re moving into places where we haven&#39;t been, not necessarily before." April was also bloody for the US-led coalition, with 104 deaths. Taken together, the two past months have been the deadliest since the March 2003 invasion that toppled The news will increase pressure on US who has already seen domestic support for his war strategy fall to an all-time low and is facing calls to set a timetable for troops withdrawals. May&#39;s casualties coincide with a "surge" in US reinforcements, which is due to peak next month. Under this plan, US and Iraqi troops are basing themselves in exposed patrol bases in order to control Baghdad street by street. US commander General David Petraeus hopes that the surge will provide breathing space for Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki&#39;s government, allowing him to push through laws to underpin a programme of national reconciliation. The continuing instability of the capital was driven home Tuesday when a squad of gunmen in police uniforms stormed a finance ministry building and dragged off five British visitors. The Britons are still missing amid fears they have fallen into the hands of one of the Shiite militia groups that have infiltrated Iraq&#39;s police. Insurgents also struck an important propaganda victory on May 12, when an Al-Qaeda gang destroyed a small US patrol manning a temporary observation post south of Baghdad, killing four soldiers and capturing three. The corpse of one was later found floating in the Euphrates river, with gunshot wounds to the head and torso. Almost three weeks after the attack his two comrades are still missing, despite a massive US manhunt. The missing men&#39;s commander, Colonel Michael Kershaw of the 10th Mountain Division&#39;s 2nd Brigade Combat Team, said that interrogations of suspects had thrown up a number of leads and that the search would continue. "Obviously we have a number of different trails we are following. They all lead to different groups. We know we have some of the people that participated," he told AFP at a base outside Baghdad on Wednesday. Kershaw&#39;s search area is a 854-square-kilometre (330-square-mile) sector in an insurgent bog of palm groves, high grass, and irrigation canals dubbed "The Triangle of Death". Kershaw&#39;s troops have questioned 1,100 people and detained 104 of them. A suicide bomber in an explosives belt killed one Iraqi policeman in an attack on his patrol and wounded at least seven more people in Fallujah, the US military said. In the northern city of Kirkuk a bomb killed one person while police in Mosul police found five corpses, three in army uniforms.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/us_iraq Cease-fire eyed to stop violence in Iraq eyed to stop violence in Iraq By PAULINE JELINEK, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 5 minutes ago WASHINGTON - U.S. military commanders are talking with Iraqi militants about cease-fires and other arrangements to try to stop the violence, the No. 2 American commander said Thursday. And he suggested he might not be able to strictly meet the September deadline for telling Congress whether 's military build up in Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno said commanders at all levels are being empowered to reach out for talks with militants, tribes, religious leaders and others in the country that has been gripped by violence on a range of fronts including insurgents, sectarian rivals and common criminals. "It's just beginning, so we have a lot of work to do in this," he said. "But we have restructured ourselves ... to work this issue." He said he thinks 80 percent of Iraqis &#151; including Sunni insurgents and Shia militants &#151; can reach reconciliation with each other, though most al-Qaida operatives won't. "We are talking about cease-fires, and maybe signing some things that say they won't conduct operations against the government of Iraq or against coalition forces.," Odierno told reporters in a video conference from Baghdad. On the assessment of operations that is due in September, he said he thinks it will take longer to tell whether the increase of nearly 30,000 troops will work as intended &#151; that is, to quell violence enough to give Iraqi officials breathing space to work on reconciliation and development issues. "The way I understand it, is we're going to be required to provide an assessment in September. So I will provide my assessment," Odierno said, adding it might not be complete. He said he will be able to assess the work of forces that arrived for the beginning of the build up in February, but that the ones just arrived this week won't be in place for a couple of weeks &#151; meaning it will be August before he might be able to tell how they're doing. "So that'll be the first time I'll be able to make a real initial assessment of the true affect of the surge," he said. "The assessment might be 'I need a little more time. ' The assessment might be, 'I've seen enough, and it's effective or I've seen enough, and it's not going to be effective.' "Right now if you asked me, I would tell you I'll probably need a little bit more time to do a true assessment," he said. "If I think I might need a little bit more time, I will give an assessment saying, 'But I'd like to have more time'," Odierno said. He said the increased effort by commanders to reach out to militants goes hand in hand with reconciliation efforts by the Iraqi government. Odierno noted that efforts to engage tribal leaders in Anbar province &#151; who have been turning against al-Qaida there &#151; has helped draw people to serve in the Iraqi security forces in record numbers and has helped reduce attacks there. For example, the attacks in Anbar in May 2006 totaled 811, while this May they were just barely over 400, Odierno said. Since the beginning of 2007, over 12,000 Iraqi citizens have volunteered for Iraqi security forces in Anbar. In all of 2006, only 1,000 had volunteered. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and other leaders are under increasing pressure from Washington to do more to achieve reconciliation among factions because, officials argue, no amount of military force can bring peace to the country without political peace. Al-Maliki announced a national reconciliation proposal nearly a year ago that has made limited progress. It offered some amnesty to members of the Sunni-led insurgency and a change in a law that had removed senior members of 's Baath Party from their jobs. "I believe there are elements that are irreconcilable, but I believe the large majority are," Odierno said. "I believe about 80 percent are reconcilable, both Jaish al-Mahdi as well as Sunni insurgents," though very few of al-Qaida. "There will be always people that are irreconcilable and ... the Iraqi government, with our support, will have to continue to conduct operations against those forces," he said. "Prime Minister Maliki and the government of Iraq have to continue to reach out to all these groups ... bringing these groups into the political process so we can deal with their differences in a peaceful way instead of in violent ways,:" Odierno said.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/gates_jobs_dc Jobs and Gates trade jests at rare joint appearance and Gates trade jests at rare joint appearance AM ET CARLSBAD, California (Reuters) - It turns out that has a soft spot in his heart for PC guys. "PC guy is great, he&#39;s got a big heart," the chief of Apple Inc. (Nasdaq: ) said on Wednesday, referring to popular television ads in which a hip young man personifies a computer and a Windows PC is played by an awkward middle-aged man. "The art of those commercials is not to be mean, but it&#39;s actually for the guys to like each other," Jobs said. His generous interpretation might have had something to do with the fact that Jobs was sitting next to Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: in their first joint interview in 14 years. Gates rolled with the joke, saying of the PC guy: "His mother loves him!" It was one of several light moments in a highly anticipated meeting of the two computer industry titans at an annual technology conference run by the Wall Street Journal. Anyone hoping for a bruising showdown between the computer industry&#39;s richest executive and one many regard as its coolest would have been disappointed. Jobs, 52, and Gates, 51, reminisced about the industry and old partnerships. The tone was jovial, even sentimental, but Jobs did get in a few good-natured digs. At one point, Gates said employees working on Microsoft&#39;s Zune portable media player admired Apple for creating the market for such devices with its hugely successful iPod line. "And we love them because they&#39;re all customers!" countered Jobs. Jobs, a boyhood electronics ace, and Gates, a programming prodigy, have seen their once-intense rivalry mellow in recent years, but the history of mutual antagonism is the stuff of legend and was even immortalized in a 1999 TV movie, "Pirates of Silicon Valley." Wednesday&#39;s event came almost exactly 10 years after a landmark 1997 deal that saw Microsoft take a financial stake in Apple and pledge to keep making software for Macs, an arrangement that helped pull the struggling company back from the brink of failure. One of the more bizarre moments on Wednesday came when the two were asked if their rivalry had been overblown. "We&#39;ve kept our marriage secret for over a decade now," Jobs said, to roars of laughter. Gates appeared flummoxed. Jobs did offer two tidbits about upcoming Apple products. He hinted that ".mac" -- the company&#39;s package of online services like e-mail and Web storage for Mac users -- is about to undergo a big overhaul. After a questioner suggested .mac had failed to live up to lofty expectations, Jobs said: "I couldn&#39;t agree with you more. We&#39;ll make up for lost time in the near future." Known for his showmanship, Jobs also enthused about the map software Apple created for its iPhone, which is scheduled to hit the market later this month. "The (application) we were able to write ... blows away any Google Maps client." Jobs said, referring to the Web search company that provided some technology for the map software. "The experience you have using it is unbelievable." Economy nearly stalled in first quarter Wachovia to buy A.G.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/usa_prosecutors_hiring_dc Justice Dept. probe expanded on hiring practices Dept. probe expanded on hiring practices PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Justice Department said on Wednesday it will investigate whether its hiring practices were improperly tainted by politics after a former aide to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales admitted posing political questions to job applicants. The department told the Senate Judiciary Committee of its decision a week after Monica Goodling, the former Gonzales aide, admitted to Congress that she had "crossed the line" and considered applicants&#39; politics in deciding whether to give them career, nonpartisan positions. In a letter to the Judiciary Committee, the heads of two Justice Department offices said they had expanded an ongoing investigation to look into whether Goodling and others used political considerations in making hiring and personnel decisions. Sen. Patrick Leahy ( ), the committee chairman, welcomed the expanded probe. "These are serious revelations that reinforce the need for meaningful congressional oversight" of the Bush administration, the Vermont Democrat said. "It is unacceptable that a senior Justice Department official was allowed to screen career employees and some judicial appointments for political loyalty, and it confirms our worst fears about the unprecedented and improper reach of politics into the department&#39;s professional ranks," he said. Leahy&#39;s panel is helping lead a congressional investigation into whether politics played a role in Gonzales&#39; firing last year of nine of the nation&#39;s 93 U.S. attorneys. Gonzales have insisted the dismissals were justified. But critics have charged that at least some of the firings appear to have been motivated by a desire to influence criminal probes of Democratic or Republican lawmakers. They have suggested the White House may have been a driving force behind the firings. Gonzales, who has rejected bipartisan calls for his resignation, had earlier ordered the department&#39;s Office of Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate the firings. The two offices later said they also were examining whether Goodling considered politics in hiring for career posts, such as assistant U.S. attorneys. That would violate federal law. In their letter to the Judiciary Committee, the heads of the two offices said they had "expanded the scope of our investigation" regarding political considerations in the hiring and personnel decisions by Goodling and others. They said they also would investigate allegations that politics played an improper role in the hiring for the department&#39;s Honors and Summer Law Intern programs and at its civil rights division.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/iraq_usa_soldiers_dc May toll for U.S. soldiers in Iraq climbs to 122 toll for U.S. soldiers in Iraq climbs to 122 1 hour, 42 minutes ago BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The U.S. military reported three more deaths in on Thursday, taking the death toll to 122 for May, already the worst month for U.S. forces there in more than two years. May is the third-worst month overall in the campaign for U.S. soldiers, behind November 2004, when 137 soldiers died, and April 2004, when 135 were killed. A total of 3,473 U.S. soldiers have been killed since the start of the invasion in March 2003. In the latest deaths, two soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb on Wednesday in southwestern Baghdad, the military said in a statement. Two more were wounded. Another soldier wounded by a roadside bomb in Baghdad&#39;s northwest on Monday died of his wounds on Tuesday. The U.S. military said another eight soldiers were wounded in a suicide car bomb attack at a checkpoint in the Sunni Arab enclave of Adamiya in northern Baghdad on Wednesday. Three Iraqi civilians, including a child, were also wounded. The U.S. military has said it expects to suffer greater casualties while it pours thousands of extra troops into Baghdad and other areas as part of a major security crackdown aimed at averting all-out sectarian civil war. Most U.S. soldiers are killed by roadside bombs. The U.S. military has accused of supplying particularly dangerous bombs called explosively formed penetrators, which can destroy an Abrams battle tank, to Shi&#39;ite militias.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/cia_leak_trial Judge will release letters in Libby case will release letters in Libby case By MATT APUZZO, Associated Press Writer WASHINGTON - A federal judge said Thursday he will release more than 150 letters he received regarding next week's sentencing of former White House aide I. Lewis "Scooter" Libby. The letters are expected to show that, despite his conviction in March of perjury and obstruction in the leak case, the former chief of staff to Vice President retains support from current and former government officials. Libby opposed the release of the letters, saying the writers never expected their words to be made public. Attorneys for several news organizations, including The Associated Press, responded last week by saying the law required the letters be released. U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton agreed, citing a need for transparency. "The court has received more than 150 sentencing letters in this case, some urging leniency for the defendant and some expressing opprobrium at the defendant's actions and calling for the imposition of a substantial prison sentence," Walton wrote. The letters will be released after Libby is sentenced Tuesday, Walton said. Addresses and other personal information will not be released. Special Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald, who has seen the letters, did not weigh in on whether to release them but noted that correspondence from current and former public officials is presumed to be public. Libby's legal defense fund has received public support from several former government officials, including former Republican Reps. Jack Kemp and Bill Paxon, former Energy Secretary and former Republican Sens. Alan Simpson, Don Nickles and Fred Thompson &#151; a likely presidential candidate. Libby was convicted of lying about his conversations with reporters about former CIA officer , whose secret position was revealed in a 2003 newspaper column. Libby was not the source for that story but a jury found that he made several false statements to leak investigators and obstructed the investigation. Fitzgerald has asked that Libby receive up to three years in prison. Libby is expected to ask Thursday that he receive no jail time.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/healthbeat_heart_failure Abused drug used to treat heart failure - Yahoo! News Abused drug used to treat heart failure By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer 2 hours, 36 minutes ago WASHINGTON - U.S. doctors are beginning a dramatic experiment this month to try to save patients dying from congestive heart failure &#151; by temporarily resting their hearts and then boosting them with a drug long abused for bodybuilding. The goal: To help the heart heal itself, and rescue patients who otherwise wouldn't survive without a heart transplant or an implanted machine to pump their hearts. "The provocative question is, once you get to that level, is it too late or are there people still recoverable even at that point?" asks Dr. Clyde Yancy of the , who is closely monitoring the experiment. The study is very small, and there's no way to predict if it will work. But British scientists reported a tantalizing hint last fall that the combination of a temporarily implanted heart pump and an asthma drug not approved for sale in this country &#151; the athlete-abused clenbuterol &#151; just might offer hope of recovery for this common, intractable killer. "We think this is a completely novel way to look at the treatment of heart failure," says Dr. Leslie Miller of Washington Hospital Center in the nation's capital, one of seven U.S. study sites. Almost 5 million Americans, and 20 million people worldwide, have congestive heart failure. Their hearts are weakened by age, damage from a survived heart attack, or other problems. It can strike seemingly healthy young people, too, for no discernible reason. Some drugs and pacemakers treat heart failure very well. But often the disease worsens over years, the heart getting weaker until patients find it difficult even to walk across a room. Fluid seeps into their lungs and blocks breathing. They have few options: A transplant &#151; and there are only about 2,200 U.S. donors a year, while 58,000 Americans die of heart failure annually &#151; or an implanted heart pump. These devices give the heart a rest, taking over the pumping action that's normally the job of the left ventricle. But the implants only last a few years. Here's where the plot thickens: Patients can improve remarkably on these pumps. Flabby enlarged hearts shrink. Cardiac muscle cells long thought unsalvageable instead seem to repair. The occasional patient gets well enough to avoid a transplant, and very rarely one recovers enough to have the implanted pump removed, too. The question is how to control that repair so more people might benefit. Last fall, British doctors reported a small but stunning success: They implanted heart pumps in 15 about-to-die patients, and used high doses of standard drugs to help the pumps shrink their hearts. Then they administered clenbuterol to stimulate, and perhaps strengthen, the heart muscle. Eleven patients recovered enough to have their implants removed, and four years later, eight still are doing well. "To see something like this was so dramatic," says Dr. Keith Aaronson, medical director of the University of Michigan's heart transplant program. He oversees the U.S. study, which will attempt to duplicate those results in at least 30 Americans. Clenbuterol is used in other countries for veterinary medicine and occasionally to treat asthma &#151; but it has never been approved for sale in the U.S., and generates concern because of illegal use by athletes and others seeking its steroid-like effects. So why could it possibly help the heart, instead of do harm? It's not clear that it does, but Miller found a clue by studying pieces of heart muscle from advanced patients. The few who recovered harbored high levels of three powerful growth factors that may spur new cardiac cell growth, and a handful studied after experimental clenbuterol use seem to harbor even more. The experiment has risks. Both implanting and removing the heart pumps can cause life-threatening complications, including bleeding or infection; some people in the British study died. Nor are clenbuterol's side effects well-known; muscle tremors occurred in some British patients. "It is incumbent upon us to be very, very careful" in informing participants, Aaronson cautions, because "you're giving people hope of something that would be really, really wonderful." Other heart-failure specialists are pinning more hope on next-generation implantable heart pumps. A much smaller version of Thoratec Inc.'s HeartMate pump that's being used in the clenbuterol experiment is headed for the U.S. market, perhaps by summer. The battery-sized HeartMate II has fewer moving parts, pumps blood in a more continuous motion, and has other changes that proponents say should make it safer and last longer. Dr. Bud Frazier of the Texas Heart Institute says he has weaned a few people off the newer heart pump already without clenbuterol, and hopes to try weaning another 17 young patients. He calls avoiding a transplant crucial for the young especially, because eventually they fail, too. Regardless of how this research pans out, the heart association's Yancy wants more patients to seek care earlier because too many don't know that standard treatments have improved in recent years. "What we have in hand right now can really improve outcomes for the large majority of people with heart failure. We just have to get it to them," says Yancy, of Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/nicaragua_iran_dc Nicaragua president to visit Iran in Gaddafi&#39;s jet - Yahoo! News Nicaragua president to visit Iran in Gaddafi&#39;s jet Sun Jun 3, 8:28 PM ET MANAGUA, Nicaragua (Reuters) - Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega, who has raised eyebrows in Washington by forging ties with , said on Sunday he will travel to the country aboard a jet on loan from Libyan leader Ortega, a Cold War-era enemy of Washington who is an ally of U.S. antagonist Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, told reporters he was leaving for Caracas, the first stop in a 10-day tour that will take him to Iran, Algeria, Libya and Cuba. Ortega said longtime U.S. critic Gaddafi loaned him a jet to cut the cost of the trip. He said he would also make a stop in Italy, but did not reveal his itinerary. The Iran visit will focus in part on getting businessmen to invest in Nicaraguan factories that build tractors and other agricultural equipment, Ortega said. "We want to improve relations with Iran in all fields, in all areas," he said. A former Marxist guerrilla who fought U.S.-backed Contra rebels during his 1980s government, Ortega has reached out to Iran since recapturing the presidency this year. He has hosted Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Managua. Ortega is seeking more aid from the United States, but he said Washington cannot stop him talking to anti-U.S. leaders. He played down any possible negative impact on U.S.-Nicaragua relations from his visit to Iran, which is at loggerheads with Washington over its atomic program and its detention of American citizens. "We are not asking permission from any country, from any president about who we meet, when we meet or what we talk about," he said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/unenvironmentclimate Hundreds of millions to suffer from melting ice, UN warns - Yahoo! News Hundreds of millions to suffer from melting ice, UN warns 2 hours, 6 minutes ago TROMSOE, Norway (AFP) - The melting of the Earth&#39;s ice has accelerated in recent decades, an alarming phenomenon that could affect hundreds of millions of people across the world, the warned in a report on Monday. "The futures of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover, sea ice, glaciers, permafrost and lake ice," the Global Outlook for Ice and Snow report, published on the eve of World Environment Day, said. "Impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture, rising sea levels affecting low lying coasts and islands and an increase in hazards such as subsidence of currently frozen land," it said. The Arctic ice sheet has shrunk by six to seven percent in winter and by 10 to 12 percent in summer over the past 30 years, the report said. The snow-covered regions of the northern hemisphere have reduced by between seven and 10 percent during March and April during the same period, according to the report presented by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The melting of the ice and snow is not only a consequence of global warming, it is also an accelerating factor, researchers presenting the report in the Norwegian Arctic town of Tromsoe said. "Snow and ice reflect 70 to 80 percent of the sun&#39;s energy, whereas water absorbs it. If snow and ice continue to melt, this will amplify global warming," report author Paal Prestrud told journalists. "Six and a half billion people on this planet have built their way of life... around a certain reality. This reality is changing even more rapidly than expected," UNEP executive director Achim Steiner added. The acceleration process also makes it more difficult to anticipate future developments, he said. "(This process) is of such magnitude that our ability to predict the future is severely constrained," Steiner told AFP. "This means that the adaptation process of coping with climate change is potentially so far-reaching in terms of economic costs and consequences that we have to act now," he added. For instance, an estimated 40 percent of the world&#39;s population could be affected by the loss of snow and glaciers on the mountains of Asia, according to researchers. Many rivers of the continent, such as the Ganges, the Brahmaputra or the Mekong, rise in the Himalayas and less ice and snow would mean less water for drinking and agriculture. Rising sea levels would affect low-lying coasts and islands, something of particular concern for countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia. "We have begun to understand how vital ice and snow are for our societies. In Italy the reduction in snow means less water in the rivers which means power stations have to be shut down," Steiner said. The report also feared that melting ice and snow could trigger more abrupt climatic changes, such as hurricanes and floods, with wider-ranging impacts on people, economies and wildlife. Melting ice and snow were considered more likely to increase hazards such as avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes. Rising temperatures and the thawing of permafrost, or frozen land, were also triggering the expansion of existing lakes and the emergence of new lakes and rivers in places like Siberia. "If the permafrost thaws, it will (further) amplify global warming and will change current sea levels," Prestrud said. "Existing indigenous species would disappear because they can&#39;t leave the region. New species would come in, migrating from the south," he added. The polar bear is, for example, expected to become extinct if the ice melts completely. Some communities are already adapting to climate change. Hunters in parts of Greenland are abandoning traditional dogsleds in favour of small open boats as a result of less predictable sea ice. "Snow and ice are continuing to decline because of human activity. They will continue to do so if greenhouse gases continue to be emitted," Prestrud warned.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/mideastisraelpolitics Israel police recommend charges against PM aide - Yahoo! News Israel police recommend charges against PM aide AM ET JERUSALEM (AFP) - Israeli police are recommending charges against a former top aide of Prime Minister Ehud Olmert after concluding inquiries into Israel&#39;s latest graft scandal, a spokesman said Monday. "Police have finished the investigation into the corruption case relating to the tax authority management and recommended charges, against Mrs Shula Zaken in particular," police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said. Zaken, Olmert&#39;s former personal secretary who worked with him for 30 years, has already been suspended for six months in connection with the corruption probe, and was placed under house arrest for 10 days last January. "Dozens of people were questioned as part of this inquiry," Rosenfeld said. Police are also recommending charges against Yoram Karshi, Zaken&#39;s brother, and fellow businessmen Koby Gur on suspicion of helping get individuals appointed to key positions within the tax authority outside normal procedure. Olmert&#39;s approval ratings are at historic lows over a string of corruption allegations implicating both himself and members of his government, in addition to heavy criticism doled out by a government inquiry into the Lebanon war.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/g8_summit_climate_dc Bush urged to back U.N. climate deal at summit - Yahoo! News Bush urged to back U.N. climate deal at summit PM ET BERLIN (Reuters) - The EU, and G8 president Germany urged U.S. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush on Monday to help strike a U.N. deal to combat climate change at a summit of major powers this week and not to pursue rival proposals. Bush, who left for Europe on Monday, last week unveiled a plan for fighting global warming beyond 2012, saying he wanted the world&#39;s top 15 emitters to meet later this year and agree new measures by the end of 2008. He shocked EU leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel who wants the G8 leading industrialized countries to forge a U.N.-backed consensus on cutting greenhouse gases at the summit in the Baltic resort of Heiligendamm. countries fear the Bush plan could sabotage efforts to produce a successor to the Kyoto Protocol under the auspices of the United Nations. They are hoping to convince Bush to integrate his proposals with the U.N. process or send a clear signal that they do not compete with it. Speaking in Berlin after a meeting with leading climate experts, President Jose Manuel Barroso called Bush&#39;s proposals a "step in the right direction" but cautioned Washington against going down a separate track. "It was a good step but I think it is important that the commitment of the United States is not seen to be in parallel or even in contradiction to the global efforts but as a contribution to the efforts that are being planned in the United Nations," Barroso said. Merkel, who favors a 50 percent cut in emissions of greenhouse gases by 2050, has acknowledged she will probably fail to overcome U.S. objections to her call for a deal to limit warming to a rise of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit). But European and U.N. officials hope the Group of Eight (G8) -- Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States -- can avert failure by giving political impetus for December U.N. climate talks in Bali, Indonesia. They hope to launch talks in Bali on extending and expanding the Kyoto Protocol. Kyoto, which Bush rejected in 2001, is meant as a first step to fend off projections of ever increasing heatwaves, floods and rising seas linked to rising emissions of greenhouse gases, mainly from burning fossil fuels. It obliges 35 rich nations to cut emissions of greenhouse gases by 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2008-12. Bush said it would cost too much and wrongly omitted developing countries. Yvo de Boer, the U.N.&#39;s top climate official, acknowledged the G8 was unlikely to agree on the firm emission reduction targets Merkel had pushed for, but said the summit could still be a success in moving the climate debate forward. "I still think that this G8 can fulfill a very important role," he said, if leaders could agree on a need to launch negotiations in Bali for sharp emission cuts, based on the latest scientific findings about warming. De Boer said White House officials had told him the U.S. plans were "supposed to be complementary" rather than a rival track to the United Nations. But he said that "maybe the G8 communique should state that is the intention." Hans-Joachim Schellnhuber, head of a top climate research institute in Potsdam and an adviser to Merkel, echoed that view and the need for clarity on the U.S. plans. "It would be really problematic to invent something new outside the U.N. process," he said a meeting with Barroso in Berlin. "Under no circumstances can the U.N. process be brought into question." Merkel received backing for her push from Canadian, French and British officials ahead of the summit. China, the world&#39;s number two emitter of greenhouse gases behind the United States, also issued a climate change plan although it made clear the country would not sacrifice economic growth to international demands for emissions cuts. The plan vows to combat global warming through energy saving, agricultural adaptation and forest planting. "This is more of a mobilization rally to draw the battle lines as the G8 approaches," said Wenran Jiang, an energy expert at the University of Auckland.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/iraq_crackdown_dc U.S., Iraqi troops control only a third of Baghdad - Yahoo! News U.S., Iraqi troops control only a third of Baghdad PM ET BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S.-led soldiers control only about a third of Baghdad, the military said on Monday, almost four months into a security crackdown during which troops are dying at rates not seen for more than two years. More than 18,000 extra U.S. troops have been deployed around Baghdad as part of the campaign, which began in mid-February and is seen as a last-ditch attempt to drag back from the brink of all-out sectarian civil war. The last of five brigades to be deployed in the crackdown will be in place soon, military spokesman Lieutenant-Christopher Garver said, adding it would not be possible to judge the success of the crackdown until all units were in place. "Obviously we&#39;re constantly doing an assessment of the plan, but that plan doesn&#39;t kick in until everyone&#39;s here," he said. But with violence spiking across Iraq as Sunni Islamist al Qaeda and insurgents try to derail the crackdown, U.S. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush and military leaders have warned that a bloody summer lies ahead. "It&#39;s going to get harder before it gets easier," Garver said of the counter-insurgency effort. "We know it&#39;s going to be a tough fight over the summer." The New York Times reported earlier on Monday that, according to an internal military assessment and local commanders, U.S. and Iraqi troops controlled 146 of Baghdad&#39;s 457 neighborhoods. The New York Times said that, according to the one-page military assessment of the crackdown, troops had either not begun operations or still faced resistance in the capital&#39;s remaining 311 neighborhoods. "That&#39;s kind of like a snapshot, those numbers are going to change the more you&#39;re working through those neighborhoods," Garver told Reuters, adding he had not seen the military assessment. Bush won a bruising battle with a Congress for war funding but is under growing pressure, including from within his own Republican Party, to show progress in the unpopular war or start bringing troops home. The crackdown in Baghdad and other areas is meant to buy time for Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki&#39;s government to meet a set of political targets set by Washington aimed at promoting national reconciliation. The benchmarks, which include a crucial revenue-sharing oil law and constitutional reform, are meant to draw minority Sunni Arabs, dominant under , away from the insurgency and back into the political process alongside majority Shi&#39;ites. June is showing similar casualty rates to May, with 17 U.S. soldiers killed in the first three days, 14 of them reported on Sunday. May was the third-worst month for U.S. soldiers since the invasion to topple Saddam in March 2003. The worst months were November 2004, when 137 were killed, and April the same year when another 135 died. Garver said more casualties were anticipated during the crackdown because thousands more troops were moving out of bases into command outposts, known as joint security stations, leaving them more exposed to attack. "There is a short-term risk and that is what we&#39;ve anticipated would happen in bringing about long-term benefit," Garver said. Tens of thousands of Iraqis have been killed in the same period. While there was a significant reduction in the number of targeted sectarian killings early on in the security crackdown, those numbers have risen again, with dozens of bodies being found in Baghdad almost every day.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/suriname_species_dc Purple frog among 24 new species found in Suriname - Yahoo! News Purple frog among 24 new species found in Suriname By Deborah Zabarenko, Environment Correspondent 1 hour, 35 minutes ago WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A purple fluorescent frog is one of 24 new species found in the South American highlands of Suriname, conservationists reported on Monday, warning that these creatures are threatened by illegal gold mining. The discovery of so many species outside the insect realm is extraordinary and points up the need to survey distant regions, said Leeanne Alonso of Conservation International, which led the expedition that found the new species. "When you go to these places that are so unexplored and so remote, we do tend to find new species ... but most of them are insects," Alonso said by telephone from Suriname&#39;s capital, Paramaribo. "What&#39;s really exciting here is we found a lot of new species of frogs and fish as well." The two-tone frog -- whose skin is covered with irregular fluorescent lavender loops on a background of aubergine -- was discovered in 2006 as part of a survey of Suriname&#39;s Nassau plateau, the conservation group said. Scientists combing Suriname&#39;s Nassau plateau and Lely Mountains found four other new frog species aside from the purple one, six species of fish, 12 dung beetles and a new ant species, the organization said in a statement. These creatures were discovered by 13 scientists who explored a region about 80 miles southeast of Paramaribo, including areas with enough clean fresh water sources to support abundant fish and amphibians. They also found 27 species native to the Guayana Shield region, which spreads over Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana and northern Brazil. One of these was the rare armored catfish, which conservationists feared was extinct because gold miners had contaminated a creek where it was last seen 50 years ago. Including the new species, the scientists observed 467 species at the two sites, ranging from large cats like panthers and pumas, to monkeys, reptiles, bats and insects. While these places are far from human civilization, they are totally unprotected and may be threatened by illegal gold-mining, Alonso said. These highland areas have also been investigated as sources of bauxite, used to make aluminum, but will most likely not be mined in the future, she said, at least not by the two mining companies that sponsored the study. The sponsors are BHP Billiton Maatschappij Suriname (BMS, a subsidiary of BHP Billiton) Suriname Aluminium Company LLC (Suralco, a subsidiary of Alcoa Inc). "It&#39;s an opportunity now for all the players, the mining companies who still have mining concessions there, the local communities, the government, the NGOs (non-governmental organizations), to try to make a regional plan for the area," Alonso said.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/iran_us_missile_defense Iran: U.S. missile defense plan 'joke' - Yahoo! News Iran: U.S. missile defense plan 'joke' By ALI AKBAR DAREINI, Associated Press Writer AM ET 's top security official on Monday called U.S. plans for an Eastern Europe missile defense shield that Washington says would protect U.S. allies from Iran a "joke," saying Tehran's missiles do not have the capability to reach Europe. "Claims by U.S. officials that installing a missile defense system in Europe is aimed at confronting Iranian missiles and protecting Europe against Iran is the joke of the year," Ali Larijani told the state-run IRNA news agency. "The range of Iran's missiles doesn't reach Europe at all," IRNA quoted Larijani as saying. The United States has said plans to install a missile defense shield in Eastern Europe are meant to protect allies against a missile launch from Iran. This week Bush is visiting Poland and the Czech Republic &#151; former Soviet satellite states that are now NATO members, where Bush wants to base parts of the missile defense system. On Sunday, Russian President assailed the White House plan and said that if the U.S. went ahead, Russia would have to take steps to restore the strategic balance in the world. He said he hoped that U.S. officials would change their minds. "If this doesn't happen, then we disclaim responsibility for our retaliatory steps, because it is not we who are the initiators of the new arms race which is undoubtedly brewing in Europe," Putin told foreign reporters days before he heads to Germany for a summit with and other leaders of the Group of Eight. Putin also said neither Iran nor have the rockets that the system is intended to shoot down, suggesting it would be used instead against Russia.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/healthbeat_heart_failure Abused drug used to treat heart failure - Yahoo! News Abused drug used to treat heart failure By LAURAN NEERGAARD, AP Medical Writer 2 hours, 37 minutes ago WASHINGTON - U.S. doctors are beginning a dramatic experiment this month to try to save patients dying from congestive heart failure &#151; by temporarily resting their hearts and then boosting them with a drug long abused for bodybuilding. The goal: To help the heart heal itself, and rescue patients who otherwise wouldn't survive without a heart transplant or an implanted machine to pump their hearts. "The provocative question is, once you get to that level, is it too late or are there people still recoverable even at that point?" asks Dr. Clyde Yancy of the , who is closely monitoring the experiment. The study is very small, and there's no way to predict if it will work. But British scientists reported a tantalizing hint last fall that the combination of a temporarily implanted heart pump and an asthma drug not approved for sale in this country &#151; the athlete-abused clenbuterol &#151; just might offer hope of recovery for this common, intractable killer. "We think this is a completely novel way to look at the treatment of heart failure," says Dr. Leslie Miller of Washington Hospital Center in the nation's capital, one of seven U.S. study sites. Almost 5 million Americans, and 20 million people worldwide, have congestive heart failure. Their hearts are weakened by age, damage from a survived heart attack, or other problems. It can strike seemingly healthy young people, too, for no discernible reason. Some drugs and pacemakers treat heart failure very well. But often the disease worsens over years, the heart getting weaker until patients find it difficult even to walk across a room. Fluid seeps into their lungs and blocks breathing. They have few options: A transplant &#151; and there are only about 2,200 U.S. donors a year, while 58,000 Americans die of heart failure annually &#151; or an implanted heart pump. These devices give the heart a rest, taking over the pumping action that's normally the job of the left ventricle. But the implants only last a few years. Here's where the plot thickens: Patients can improve remarkably on these pumps. Flabby enlarged hearts shrink. Cardiac muscle cells long thought unsalvageable instead seem to repair. The occasional patient gets well enough to avoid a transplant, and very rarely one recovers enough to have the implanted pump removed, too. The question is how to control that repair so more people might benefit. Last fall, British doctors reported a small but stunning success: They implanted heart pumps in 15 about-to-die patients, and used high doses of standard drugs to help the pumps shrink their hearts. Then they administered clenbuterol to stimulate, and perhaps strengthen, the heart muscle. Eleven patients recovered enough to have their implants removed, and four years later, eight still are doing well. "To see something like this was so dramatic," says Dr. Keith Aaronson, medical director of the University of Michigan's heart transplant program. He oversees the U.S. study, which will attempt to duplicate those results in at least 30 Americans. Clenbuterol is used in other countries for veterinary medicine and occasionally to treat asthma &#151; but it has never been approved for sale in the U.S., and generates concern because of illegal use by athletes and others seeking its steroid-like effects. So why could it possibly help the heart, instead of do harm? It's not clear that it does, but Miller found a clue by studying pieces of heart muscle from advanced patients. The few who recovered harbored high levels of three powerful growth factors that may spur new cardiac cell growth, and a handful studied after experimental clenbuterol use seem to harbor even more. The experiment has risks. Both implanting and removing the heart pumps can cause life-threatening complications, including bleeding or infection; some people in the British study died. Nor are clenbuterol's side effects well-known; muscle tremors occurred in some British patients. "It is incumbent upon us to be very, very careful" in informing participants, Aaronson cautions, because "you're giving people hope of something that would be really, really wonderful." Other heart-failure specialists are pinning more hope on next-generation implantable heart pumps. A much smaller version of Thoratec Inc.'s HeartMate pump that's being used in the clenbuterol experiment is headed for the U.S. market, perhaps by summer. The battery-sized HeartMate II has fewer moving parts, pumps blood in a more continuous motion, and has other changes that proponents say should make it safer and last longer. Dr. Bud Frazier of the Texas Heart Institute says he has weaned a few people off the newer heart pump already without clenbuterol, and hopes to try weaning another 17 young patients. He calls avoiding a transplant crucial for the young especially, because eventually they fail, too. Regardless of how this research pans out, the heart association's Yancy wants more patients to seek care earlier because too many don't know that standard treatments have improved in recent years. "What we have in hand right now can really improve outcomes for the large majority of people with heart failure. We just have to get it to them," says Yancy, of Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/guantanamo_tribunals_khadr_dc Judge&#39;s ruling may halt all Guantanamo trials - Yahoo! News Judge&#39;s ruling may halt all Guantanamo trials GUANTANAMO BAY U.S. NAVAL BASE, Cuba (Reuters) - The U.S. war crimes tribunals at Guantanamo came to a screeching halt on Monday when a military judge dropped all the charges against a young Canadian in a ruling that could preclude trying any of the 380 prisoners. Army Col. Peter Brownback, the judge, said the military tribunal lacked jurisdiction over Canadian Omar Khadr because he did not meet the definition of those subject to trial under a law the U.S. Congress drafted last year. "It&#39;s not a technicality. It&#39;s another demonstration that the system simply doesn&#39;t work," said the tribunal&#39;s chief defense counsel, Marine Col. Dwight Sullivan. "Fundamentally it is a system of justice that does not comport with American values." The judge said a military review board had labeled Khadr an "enemy combatant" during a 2004 hearing in Guantanamo. But the Military Commissions Act adopted by the U.S. Congress in 2006 said only "unlawful enemy combatants" could be tried in the Guantanamo tribunals. Brownback said Khadr did not meet that strict definition because there had been no formal proceeding designating him as unlawful. Because none of the 380 foreign captives held at Guantanamo have been designated in that way, lawyers said they could not be tried unless they first faced proceedings reclassifying them as unlawful enemy combatants. Brownback dismissed the charges against Khadr, but left open the possibility that charges could be re-filed if Khadr went back before a review board and was formally reclassified. This was the latest setback for the Bush government&#39;s efforts to put the Guantanamo detainees through some form of judicial process. It was forced to rewrite the rules last year after the deemed the old tribunals illegal. Khadr, who was captured in a firefight in at age 15, was accused of killing a U.S. soldier with a grenade and wounding another in a battle at a suspected al Qaeda compound in Afghanistan in 2002. He was also charged with conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism along with murder, attempted murder and spying, for allegedly conducting surveillance of U.S. military convoys in Afghanistan. Khadr, now 20 and said by his family to be in poor health, wore a tan prison uniform and a shaggy beard during the brief hearing and showed no reaction to the surprise ruling. Khadr&#39;s sister, Zaynab Khadr, told CBC television in Canada, the ruling was surprising. "Nobody expected it .... I hope my brother can come home." HALT TO TRIALS URGED One of the prosecutors, Army Capt. Keith Petty, said Khadr clearly met the definition of an unlawful combatant because he fought for al Qaeda, which was not part of the regular, uniformed armed forces of any nation. He said he was prepared to produce a video of Khadr wearing civilian clothes while planting a roadside bomb, as evidence he was an unlawful combatant. But Brownback said the 2006 law authorizing the tribunals barred him from proceeding unless Khadr was formally declared to be unlawful. Congress wrote the law after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down an earlier version of the tribunals established by President George W. Bush President George W. Bush to try terrorism suspects at Guantanamo. Brownback gave prosecutors 72 hours to appeal his ruling, but the appeals court authorized under the 2006 law has not been set up and it was unlikely it could be created that quickly. Sullivan said that rather than putting the 380 prisoners through another review to change their status, the United States should scrap the military tribunals and move the trials to the regular U.S. federal courts, he said. "We don&#39;t need any more evidence that it&#39;s a failure," Sullivan said. "This system should just stop." Another prisoner, Salim Ahmed Hamdan of Yemin, was scheduled to appear before a different military judge on Monday for arraignment on charges of conspiracy and providing material support for terrorism. That judge was expected to drop the charges against Hamdan, who is accused of driving and acting as his bodyguard. Group claims captured troops were killed Rep.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/heart_pressure_omega3_dc Omega-3 fatty acids reduce blood pressure: study - Yahoo! News Omega-3 fatty acids reduce blood pressure: study DALLAS (Reuters) - A diet with liberal servings of fish, nuts and seeds rich in nutrients called omega-3 fatty acids can help lower a person&#39;s blood pressure, according to a study released on Monday. "A large percentage of people between ages 20 and 60 have a rise in blood pressure, and by middle age many have high blood pressure," said Dr. Jeremiah Stamler, professor emeritus of preventive medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, who worked on the study. "We&#39;re looking at dietary factors that may help prevent that rise, and omega-3 fatty acids are a small, but important piece of the action," Stamler said. The study looked at diet and its relation to blood pressure in 4,680 men and women, ages 40 to 59, who lived in Japan, China, Britain and the United States. They all provided in-depth details about their diets and alcohol consumption, gave urine samples and had their blood pressure measured twice at each of four study visits. Researchers then adjusted for 17 variables known to influence blood pressure such as age, gender, weight, salt intake and exercise. The people who ate diets rich in omega-3 fatty acids had slightly lower blood pressure, on average, than people who ate diets with less of the nutrient, the researchers reported in the "With blood pressure, every millimeter counts. The effect of each nutrient is apparently small but independent, so together they can add up to a substantial impact on blood pressure," said Dr. Hirotsugu Ueshima of Shiga University of Medical Science in Otsu, Japan. "If you can reduce blood pressure a few millimeters from eating less salt, losing a few pounds, avoiding heavy drinking, eating more vegetables, whole grains and fruits (for their fiber, minerals, vegetable protein and other nutrients) and getting more omega-3 fatty acids, then you&#39;ve made a big difference," Ueshima said in a statement. When it comes to omega-3 fatty acids, not all fish or nuts are equal. Fatty fish such as trout, salmon and mackerel are rich in this crucial group of nutrients. Walnuts, flaxseed and canola oil are also good sources of omega-3 fatty acids and people who got their omega-3s from these sources had just as much benefit as those who get them by eating fish, the study found. Omega-3 fatty acid intake has also been linked to better brain development and a lower overall risk of cancer and heart disease.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/israel_occupation_amnesty Amnesty: Watchdog needed for Israel - Yahoo! News Amnesty: Watchdog needed for Israel By STEVE WEIZMAN, Associated Press Writer Sun Jun 3, 11:05 PM ET JERUSALEM - Amnesty International marked 40 years since the outbreak of the 1967 Middle East war with a call for settlements and roadblocks, for the Palestinians to end attacks on Israeli civilians and for the international community to monitor both sides. "For 40 years, the international community has failed adequately to address the Israeli-Palestinian problem; it cannot, must not, wait another 40 years to do so," Amnesty regional director Malcolm Smart said in a statement accompanying a special Amnesty report released Monday, entitled "Enduring Occupation." Since the outbreak of the current wave of Palestinian-Israeli violence in 2000, about 4,330 people have been killed on the Palestinian side and 1,111 on the Israeli side. Amnesty said human rights violations by both sides highlighted the need for an international watchdog. "Amnesty International is calling for the urgent deployment of an effective international human rights monitoring mechanism to monitor compliance by both parties ... with their obligations under international law," it said. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Mark Regev said Israel already had sufficient oversight built into its own systems, and that it "is the only Middle Eastern country where human rights are at the center of our political culture." Raji Sourani, head of the Gaza-based Palestinian Center for Human Rights said what was needed was a peacekeeping force, rather than monitors with no mandate to intervene, citing a six-nation monitoring group deployed in 1994 in the West Bank town of Hebron as an example of passive observers. "We are calling for international protection forces," he said. "We have experienced monitoring in Hebron and elsewhere. It is not effective at all. It's shown to be impractical." Israel defeated three Arab armies in the Six-Day War, which erupted on June 5, 1967, putting it in control today of about 3.5 million Palestinians in the West Bank, Israeli troops and settlers pulled out of Gaza in 2005, but the Israeli military still keeps a tight grip on Palestinian movement there. In the West Bank, Israel is building a network of walls, trenches and barbed-wire fences it says is meant to keep out attackers, but which puts some 8.5 percent of Palestinian land on the "Israeli" side. The Amnesty report called on Israel to "lift the regime" of blockades and other restrictions, including the "fence/wall inside the West Bank." It also appealed to Palestinian militants "to end immediately attacks on civilians and on the to take effective action to stop and prevent such attacks and bring to justice those responsible."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/china_remembering_tiananmen Tiananmen Square survivors seek reform - Yahoo! News Tiananmen Square survivors seek reform By ANITA CHANG, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 55 minutes ago BEIJING - For the first time in 18 years, Ding Zilin marked the anniversary of her son's death with a visit to the place where he was shot amid a violent government crackdown on protests at Tiananmen Square. Police usually are quick to snuff out any memorials in Beijing for those killed in the crackdown that culminated in June 4, 1989, while China's government still calls the seven-week Tiananmen protest a counter-revolutionary riot and has yet to fully disclose what happened. But with China's human rights record under renewed scrutiny ahead of the 2008 Olympics, survivors of the bloody crackdown in Beijing marked the event's 18th anniversary on Monday by demanding political reform. And Ding, who for years was placed under house arrest during Tiananmen anniversaries and other sensitive times, wept on the eve of the anniversary as she placed a photo of her son on the spot where he died a few kilometers west of Tiananmen. "It's been 18 years and I felt like I let him down and let down the others who died with him," she said of her son, who was killed as he hid behind a flower bed from soldiers enforcing martial law on the night of June 3. He had turned 17 the day before. In Hong Kong on Monday &#151; the only place in China where a large, public commemoration is allowed &#151; tens of thousands gathered to mourn the dead at a candlelight vigil. In Beijing's Tiananmen Square, there were no immediate reports of protests and only tourists gathered to watch a daily flag-raising ceremony amid tight security. Ding, co-founder of the Tiananmen Mothers, a group that represents families of those who died, said police did not try to stop her Sunday night, though plainclothes agents may have been observing the vigil. "Right now, this is all I can do. Not getting justice for them, we're still pushing for it but there's been no response," said Ding, who has campaigned to get the government to acknowledge those killed in the crackdown and compensate their families. "Their spirits are obviously not at peace." Most of the surviving students who led the Tiananmen protests have drifted away from activism and into careers in business or other professions, but prominent student leader Wang Dan has continued to push for political reform in China as he pursues a doctorate in history at Harvard University. He said in a videotaped message that China's recent economic success cannot make up for the crackdown and killed hundreds, maybe thousands, of people. "Who can guarantee things that happened 18 years ago will not happen 18 years later?" Wang said. "Even if we become more powerful economically, China still cannot rise in international society." Another former student leader, Wu'er Kaixi, lamented that the memory of Tiananmen appears to be fading worldwide. "The Chinese government is unwilling to face the truth and seems to hope that the 'problem' of June 4 will simply go away," Wu'er, who has worked as a businessman and radio broadcaster in Taiwan, told The Associated Press. "For the most part, the world seems willing to go along with this." In the former British colony of Hong Kong, many residents in 1989 supported the Tiananmen protesters and the violence raised fears that the Communist leadership would not honor its promise to allow Hong Kong the civil liberties its people enjoyed under British rule. But 10 years after the hand-over, the city still enjoys freedoms that people on the mainland can only dream about. Street protests are common and the press frequently criticizes the government, though media watchdogs say self-censorship is common. A candlelight vigil Monday night filled up six soccer fields at Victoria Park near downtown Hong Kong. Amy Chan, 60, brought her 5-year-old granddaughter. "Although she is young, we need to let her know the history," Chan said. Tonny Chin, 50, a clerk, said he has attended the vigil every year since 1989. "The June fourth incident is a tragedy for China," he said. "We need to vindicate it." New York-based Human Rights Watch said Beijing's failure to account for the crackdown casts a pall on its campaign to project a new image ahead of the Olympics in 14 months. "Beijing &#151; and by extension, the 2008 &#151; will remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June 1989," said Sophie Richardson, deputy Asia director of the human rights group. Associated Press writers Dikky Sinn and William Foreman in Hong Kong and Annie Huang in Taipei, Taiwan, contributed to this report.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/markets_oil_dc Oil at $70 as cyclone nears Mideast Gulf - Yahoo! News Oil at $70 as cyclone nears Mideast Gulf By Jane Merriman and Janet McBride 1 hour, 28 minutes ago LONDON (Reuters) - Oil surged above &#36;70 on Monday on news a cyclone was headed toward the oil-producing Arabian peninsula with the potential to disrupt shipping and output. Top exporter Saudi Arabia said it expected its oil facilities to escape unscathed from the gathering storm. Fellow member the United Arab Emirates also appeared to be outside the path of the storm, a shipping agent said. Minor oil producer Oman put its army and police on high alert, however, and warned the population of very high waves when winds of up to 205 km (127 miles) per hour reached land. London Brent crude, currently seen as a better gauge of the global market than U.S. oil, was up &#36;1.33 cents at &#36;70.40 at 2:30 p.m. EDT, off a session high of &#36;70.63. U.S. crude settled up &#36;1.13 cents at &#36;66.21. "Prices have turned around on news of a major tropical storm that has the potential to interrupt oil shipments from the Gulf," said Addison Armstrong of TFS Energy Futures in the United States. Oman produces just 715,000 barrels per day of oil, a small fraction of Saudi Arabia&#39;s almost 9 million bpd. Earlier in the day, oil prices had drawn continued support from output disruptions in Nigeria that have tightened supplies of gasoline-rich crude during peak summer demand. Investors also took note of a defiant statement by Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He said , the world&#39;s fourth biggest oil exporter, would not retreat from the "field of danger" to protect its right to develop nuclear technology. In fellow OPEC member Nigeria, militants have called a one-month truce in attacks on oil installations in the Niger Delta. But analysts saw little to suggest an end to 18 months of violence that has shut about a third of Nigeria&#39;s oil output. "Nigeria is keeping the market quite tight," said Helen Henton, head of commodity research at Standard Chartered Bank. She noted the International Energy Agency has called repeatedly for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production. "But OPEC is being quite strident about it being a U.S. refinery problem," she said. A series of outages at oil refineries in top oil consumer the United States have contributed to a supply bottleneck in U.S. gasoline supplies, which are lower than usual. Some refineries are now coming back onstream. Oil had surged to a nine-month high above &#36;71 on May 24, partly on concerns about Nigeria and U.S. gasoline. Dealers will remain on alert for any sign of hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico after the Atlantic basin storm season began on June 1, although the first system of the season to approach the region -- Tropical Storm Barry -- weakened by the weekend, pouring rain on Florida.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/israel_holocaust_diary Polish girl's Holocaust diary unveiled - Yahoo! News Polish girl's Holocaust diary unveiled By ARON HELLER, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 1 minute ago JERUSALEM - The diary of a 14-year-old Jewish girl, dubbed the "Polish Anne Frank," was unveiled Monday by 's Holocaust museum more than 60 years after the teenager vividly described the world crumbling around her as she came of age in a Jewish ghetto. "The rope around us is getting tighter and tighter," Rutka Laskier wrote in 1943, shortly before she was deported to Auschwitz. "I'm turning into an animal waiting to die." Within a few months Rutka was dead and, it seemed, her diary lost. But last year, a Polish friend who had saved the notebook finally came forth, exposing a riveting historical document. "Rutka's Notebook" is both a daily account of the horrors of the Holocaust in Bedzin, Poland, and a scrapbook detailing the life of a teenager in extraordinary circumstances. The 60-page memoir includes innocent adolescent banter, concerns and first loves &#151; combined with a cold analysis of the fate of European Jewry. Some 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World War II, after European Jews were herded into ghettos, banned from most jobs and forced to wear yellow stars to identify them. "I simply can't believe that one day I will be allowed to leave this house without the yellow star. Or even that this war will end one day. If this happens I will probably lose my mind from joy," she wrote on Feb. 5, 1943. "The little faith I used to have has been completely shattered. If God existed, He would have certainly not permitted that human beings be thrown alive into furnaces, and the heads of little toddlers be smashed with gun butts or shoved into sacks and gassed to death." Reports of the gassing of Jews, which were not common knowledge in the West by then, apparently had filtered into the Bedzin ghetto, which was near Auschwitz, Yad Vashem experts said. The following day she opened her entry with a heated description of her hatred toward her Nazi tormentors. But then, in an effortless transition, she described her crush on a boy named Janek and the anticipation of a first kiss. "I think my womanhood has awoken in me. That means, yesterday when I was taking a bath and the water stroked my body, I longed for someone's hands to stroke me," she wrote. "I didn't know what it was, I have never had such sensations until now." Later that day, she shifted back to her harsh reality, describing how she watched as a Nazi soldier tore a Jewish baby away from his mother and killed him with his bare hands. The diary chronicles Rutka's life from January to April 1943. She shared it with her friend Stanislawa Sapinska, who she met after Rutka's family moved into a home owned by Sapinska's family, which had been confiscated by the Nazis to be included in the Bedzin ghetto. Sapinska came to inspect the house and the girls &#151; one Jewish, one Christian &#151; formed a deep bond. When Rutka feared she would not survive, she told her friend about the diary. Sapinska offered to hide it in the basement under the floorboards. After the war, she returned to reclaim it. "She wanted me to save the diary," Sapinska, now in her 80s, recalled Monday. "She said 'I don't know if I will survive, but I want the diary to live on, so that everyone will know what happened to the Jews.'" Sapinska stashed the diary in her home library for more than 60 years. She said it was a precious memento and thought it to be too private to share with others. Only at the behest of her young nephew did she agree to hand it over last year. "He convinced me that it was an important historical artifact," she said in Polish. In 1943, Rutka was the same age as Anne Frank, the Dutch teenager whose Holocaust diary has become one of the most widely read books in the world. Yad Vashem said Rutka's newly discovered diary was authenticated by experts and Holocaust survivors. Rutka's father, Yaakov, was the family's only survivor. He died in 1986. But unlike Anne Frank's father, he kept his painful past inside. After the war, he moved to Israel, where he started a new family. His Israeli daughter, Zahava Sherz, said her father never spoke of his other children, and the diary introduced her to the long-lost family she never knew. "I was struck by this deep connection to Rutka," said Sherz, 57. "I was an only child, and now I suddenly have an older sister. This black hole was suddenly filled, and I immediately fell in love with her." "I have a feeling that I am writing for the last time," Rutka wrote on Feb. 20, 1943, as Nazi soldiers began gathering Jews outside her home for deportation. "I wish it would end already! This torment; this is hell. I try to escape from these thoughts of the next day, but they keep haunting me like nagging flies. If only I could say, it's over, you only die once ... but I can't, because despite all these atrocities, I want to live, and wait for the following day." However, Rutka would write again. Her last entry was dated April 24, 1943, and her last written words were: "I'm very bored. The entire day I'm walking around the room. I have nothing to do." In August, she and her family were sent to Auschwitz, where she is believed to have been killed upon arrival.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/unenvironmentclimate Hundreds of millions to suffer from melting ice, UN warns - Yahoo! News Hundreds of millions to suffer from melting ice, UN warns 2 hours, 7 minutes ago TROMSOE, Norway (AFP) - The melting of the Earth&#39;s ice has accelerated in recent decades, an alarming phenomenon that could affect hundreds of millions of people across the world, the warned in a report on Monday. "The futures of hundreds of millions of people across the world will be affected by declines in snow cover, sea ice, glaciers, permafrost and lake ice," the Global Outlook for Ice and Snow report, published on the eve of World Environment Day, said. "Impacts are likely to include significant changes in the availability of water supplies for drinking and agriculture, rising sea levels affecting low lying coasts and islands and an increase in hazards such as subsidence of currently frozen land," it said. The Arctic ice sheet has shrunk by six to seven percent in winter and by 10 to 12 percent in summer over the past 30 years, the report said. The snow-covered regions of the northern hemisphere have reduced by between seven and 10 percent during March and April during the same period, according to the report presented by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). The melting of the ice and snow is not only a consequence of global warming, it is also an accelerating factor, researchers presenting the report in the Norwegian Arctic town of Tromsoe said. "Snow and ice reflect 70 to 80 percent of the sun&#39;s energy, whereas water absorbs it. If snow and ice continue to melt, this will amplify global warming," report author Paal Prestrud told journalists. "Six and a half billion people on this planet have built their way of life... around a certain reality. This reality is changing even more rapidly than expected," UNEP executive director Achim Steiner added. The acceleration process also makes it more difficult to anticipate future developments, he said. "(This process) is of such magnitude that our ability to predict the future is severely constrained," Steiner told AFP. "This means that the adaptation process of coping with climate change is potentially so far-reaching in terms of economic costs and consequences that we have to act now," he added. For instance, an estimated 40 percent of the world&#39;s population could be affected by the loss of snow and glaciers on the mountains of Asia, according to researchers. Many rivers of the continent, such as the Ganges, the Brahmaputra or the Mekong, rise in the Himalayas and less ice and snow would mean less water for drinking and agriculture. Rising sea levels would affect low-lying coasts and islands, something of particular concern for countries such as Bangladesh and Indonesia. "We have begun to understand how vital ice and snow are for our societies. In Italy the reduction in snow means less water in the rivers which means power stations have to be shut down," Steiner said. The report also feared that melting ice and snow could trigger more abrupt climatic changes, such as hurricanes and floods, with wider-ranging impacts on people, economies and wildlife. Melting ice and snow were considered more likely to increase hazards such as avalanches and floods from the build-up of potentially unstable glacial lakes. Rising temperatures and the thawing of permafrost, or frozen land, were also triggering the expansion of existing lakes and the emergence of new lakes and rivers in places like Siberia. "If the permafrost thaws, it will (further) amplify global warming and will change current sea levels," Prestrud said. "Existing indigenous species would disappear because they can&#39;t leave the region. New species would come in, migrating from the south," he added. The polar bear is, for example, expected to become extinct if the ice melts completely. Some communities are already adapting to climate change. Hunters in parts of Greenland are abandoning traditional dogsleds in favour of small open boats as a result of less predictable sea ice. "Snow and ice are continuing to decline because of human activity. They will continue to do so if greenhouse gases continue to be emitted," Prestrud warned.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/cancer_breast_screening_dc MRI better at spotting precancerous growths - Yahoo! News MRI better at spotting precancerous growths AM ET CHICAGO (Reuters) - MRI scans are far better than mammograms at spotting a type of precancerous growth before it becomes invasive breast cancer, a German researcher said on Sunday. Dr. Christiane Kuhl of the University of Bonn suggested the costly scans should be used routinely to screen for breast cancer. "MRI is better than mammography. You cannot recommend a woman wait for an MRI study to be done," said Kuhl, who presented results from her study at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago. Kuhl studied a kind of precancerous growth that forms in the lining of the milk duct called ductal carcinoma in situ, or DCIS, which accounts for up to 25 percent of all growths found on a mammogram -- a type of X-ray. "Mammography is considered the mainstay for diagnosing DCIS," she said at the conference. But her study found that magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, was more likely to spot high-grade DCIS, an aggressive type of growth that increases the chances a woman would get breast cancer by about 40 percent. Some 17 percent of the more than 52,000 cases of DCIS diagnosed in the United States each year are considered to be high grade. About 180,000 U.S. men and women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007. In her study, Kuhl screened more than 5,000 women. Of those, 167 were diagnosed with DCIS. Those women got both an MRI and a mammogram. The MRI found nearly double the amount of growths, and half of the most aggressive high-grade growths were only seen on MRI. If found early, high-grade DCIS is easily removed by surgery, but untreated, it can develop into invasive breast cancer. Kuhl believes the MRI test is better and should be used as part of routine screening, but others at the conference disagreed. "We do not recommend use of MRI for women of average risk," said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the , which does recommend MRI screening plus mammography for certain women at higher risk for breast cancer. Dr. Julie Gralow, assistant professor of oncology at the University of Washington in Seattle, said, "This is not something that is ready for prime time around the country." She said it is too early to recommend widespread screening using MRI because the technology has not yet become standardized enough in breast cancer to offer uniformly reliable results. She said efforts are under way to standardize breast MRI tests. But the biggest stumbling block is cost, Gralow said. MRI costs about 15 times the cost of a mammogram. "If this were cheap it would be an easier discussion," she said.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/thenation/7201962 Sex and Reality - Yahoo! News People of the Web AM ET commissioned by Congress concluded that abstinence-only programs are completely ineffective in preventing or delaying teenagers from having sexual intercourse. Nor do they lower unwanted pregnancy rates or lessen the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. Given this reality, it&#39;s bad news that the federal government will waste $176 million on these programs in 2007 alone. "In short, American taxpayers appear to have paid over one billion federal dollars for programs that have no impact," said Rep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif), chair of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The good news: Leaders at the state and federal level are learning how are and are starting to take action. Several states, including California, Maine, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin have already rejected Title V funds, for being too restrictive. And more recently, Congressional leaders have indicated that they would allow Title V, a $50 million abstinence-only program, to expire on June 30. "Abstinence-only seems to be a colossal failure," said Rep. John Dingell, (D- MI) chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee which has jurisdiction over Title V funding. Rep. Waxman is also considering holding hearings on the issue in the near future. "With all we know about how to prevent teen pregnancy and reduce sexually transmitted diseases," said Rep. Diana DeGette, (D-Col.), "it is high time to redirect the millions of federal dollars that we squander every year on abstinence-only education to programs that actually work."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/healthcare_politics_usa_dc Companies seen warming to idea of health reform - Yahoo! News Companies seen warming to idea of health reform PM ET CHICAGO (Reuters) - As rising health costs erode profits, U.S. corporations are expected to warm up to health care reform under the next president -- a prospect that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. and George W Bush fought the presidential election, I can&#39;t think of any business group that called on either candidate to launch health reform," said Jason Furman, director of the Hamilton Project, an initiative of the Brookings Institution think tank. "This time, I think it will be different." The U.S. private sector has traditionally been seen as opposing health reform as it could mean either higher taxes or greater state involvement -- both anathema to business. But thanks to burgeoning health costs, analysts say that, with the possible exception of some pharmaceutical firms and health insurers, the private sector accepts reform is needed and is likely to be championed by the Democrats if they win the 2008 presidential or Congressional elections. "We really are getting to the end of our rope with health care costs," said Robert Laszewski president of health care consulting firm Health Policy and Strategy Associates, Inc. "You won&#39;t get Republican CEOs proposing anything radical. More likely they&#39;ll say: &#39;Here, just take the damn thing."&#39; The National Coalition of Health Care estimates the average annual premium for an employer health-care plan for a family of four is nearly &#36;11,500. According to the U.S. , almost 45 million Americans have no health insurance. Double-digit increases in premiums every year for much of the last decade have encouraged some corporate behemoths such as General Electric Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. to urge changes to the system -- Wal-Mart wants universal health care coverage for all Americans by 2012 -- but have made no specific reform proposals. Companies such as Wal-Mart are also receiving a push from some shareholders. At the retailer&#39;s shareholder meeting last Friday, a proposal from the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) -- a coalition of 275 faith-based investors with an estimated &#36;110 billion in assets between them -- called on Wal-Mart to say how it would address health care reform. Although the proposal was defeated, Margaret Weber, corporate responsibility coordinator at ICCR member the Basilian Fathers of Toronto, said the proposal had served its purpose. "The idea is to bring the issue of health care into the open and engage companies in the debate on reform," she said. Some American companies complain that health costs for employees past and present, plus their dependents, are hurting business. Marcey Evans, health care spokeswoman at Ford Motor Co., said the company covers 570,000 people and spent &#36;3.5 billion on health care last year. This, she said, "adds &#36;1,200 to the cost of every vehicle we produce." Even factoring in foreign competitors&#39; health costs, Ford still pays &#36;600 more per vehicle extra. "This puts us at a competitive disadvantage," Evans added. While not everyone has a legacy like Ford&#39;s or fellow Detroit automakers General Motors Co. and DaimlerChrysler AG&#39;s Chrysler unit, all U.S. companies are feeling the effect of rising costs, Weber said. "(U.S. firms) are the ones paying for health care and they&#39;re feeling the pain," she said. "If they don&#39;t pay their reputation suffers, so it&#39;s in their interest to back reform." "Many companies are ready to participate constructively in reform instead of obstructing it." The Hamilton Project&#39;s Furman said there is "growing acceptance in the private sector that reform is a necessity based on individual, corporate and government participation." But companies do appear reluctant to discuss particulars. Ford&#39;s Evans said the company "welcomes dialogue on this national problem," but does not endorse any proposal. And Katie Strong, director of congressional and public affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce U.S. Chamber of Commerce , said: "We&#39;re still far from the next presidential elections and there are no concrete plans on the table for us to comment on." Dean Baker, co-director for the Center for Economic and Policy Research, said corporate reluctance to discuss policy specifics reflects long-standing opposition to health reform. "While the private sector knows it needs to participate in this process, it&#39;s unlikely to be a standard bearer for reform," Baker said. Harvard University Professor of health policy and political analysis Robert Blendon went further, saying American businesses are stuck between the need for reform and gratitude to the current Republican administration. "The business community has been treated very well by and does not want to appear ungrateful by backing any particular reform," Blendon said. "The private sector will be a force of dissatisfaction, but not a force for change."

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/china_tiananmen_dc China newspaper ad salutes Tiananmen mothers - Yahoo! News China newspaper ad salutes Tiananmen mothers PM ET BEIJING (Reuters) - An advertisement saluting mothers of students and workers killed in the 1989 Tiananmen Square crackdown appeared in a newspaper in southwest China on Monday, two witnesses said, in a rare public criticism of the massacre. The advertisement, in the lower right corner of page 14 of the Chengdu Evening News, read: "Paying tribute to the strong mothers of June 4 victims," two local residents who saw it told Reuters. Police are investigating how the advertisement got into the newspaper, one local resident who requested anonymity said. A newspaper editor and a local Communist Party official, reached by telephone, declined immediate comment. In Hong Kong, some 55,000 people attended a candlelit vigil to remember the dead, according to organizers&#39; estimates. On June 4, 1989, People&#39;s Liberation Army troops and tanks crushed student-led pro-democracy demonstrations centered on Beijing&#39;s Tiananmen Square, killing hundreds, possibly thousands of workers and students. Tiananmen Square was quiet on Monday, China&#39;s media were silent about the bloody crackdown that took place in and around the square 18 years ago to the day, but rights groups said it would not be forgotten. "I want to tell those who claim that Tiananmen &#39;belongs to another era&#39; that, behind the high, barbed-wire-ringed walls of the Chinese prisons, Tiananmen prisoners are still suffering," the Chinese Human Rights Defenders said in an e-mailed statement, quoting an unnamed former prisoner of conscience. The subject is still taboo and the government has rejected public calls to overturn the verdict that the protests leading to the crackdown were "counter-revolutionary," or subversive. The Communist Party&#39;s then chief, Zhao Ziyang, was sacked for opposing the crackdown and died in 2005 after spending more than 15 years under house arrest. Bao Tong, a top aide of Zhao, told Reuters that China could never forget the events of 1989. "To forget June 4 is a national humiliation," he said in a rare interview at his Beijing apartment. "June 4 was a tragedy not just for China but for the whole of mankind. We will still be talking about June 4 in 1,000 years&#39; time." Tiananmen Square itself was full of the usual tour groups, both Chinese and foreign, and locals flying kites, as well as plainclothes security and police vans. At its north end, in front of the giant portrait of Mao Zedong, police surrounded a woman and rifled through her bag before bundling her into the back of a van, a sign of the tight rein China keeps on petitioners and protesters. Despite activists&#39; efforts to keep memories of the events alive, the virtual silence on that period within China means many people know little about the Tiananmen movement. One vendor surnamed Zhang, hawking copies of Mao&#39;s Little Red Book, at first said he had no idea of the sensitive anniversary, only recalling it after some prompting. "I know what you mean," he said finally. "But I come here every day and there&#39;s nothing like that now." "I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about," said a woman, 26, visiting from the southeastern port city of Xiamen with her husband and toddler. Ding Zilin, who leads the pressure group Tiananmen Mothers, was allowed for the first time to lay flowers at the spot where her son was shot and hold a brief memorial ceremony, said the Hong Kong-based Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy. In Hong Kong, tens of thousands of people turned out for the annual candlelit vigil. "It is a matter of principle. What is wrong is wrong. As long as China doesn&#39;t admit any wrongdoing, I will keep coming to the vigil," said 46-year-old graphic designer William Tam. Key figures have been silenced at home or forced into exile abroad since 1989, but voices for reform have mutated into a crusade involving a new generation of civil rights campaigners.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/markets_oil_dc Oil at $70 as cyclone nears Mideast Gulf - Yahoo! News Oil at $70 as cyclone nears Mideast Gulf By Jane Merriman and Janet McBride 1 hour, 29 minutes ago LONDON (Reuters) - Oil surged above &#36;70 on Monday on news a cyclone was headed toward the oil-producing Arabian peninsula with the potential to disrupt shipping and output. Top exporter Saudi Arabia said it expected its oil facilities to escape unscathed from the gathering storm. Fellow member the United Arab Emirates also appeared to be outside the path of the storm, a shipping agent said. Minor oil producer Oman put its army and police on high alert, however, and warned the population of very high waves when winds of up to 205 km (127 miles) per hour reached land. London Brent crude, currently seen as a better gauge of the global market than U.S. oil, was up &#36;1.33 cents at &#36;70.40 at 2:30 p.m. EDT, off a session high of &#36;70.63. U.S. crude settled up &#36;1.13 cents at &#36;66.21. "Prices have turned around on news of a major tropical storm that has the potential to interrupt oil shipments from the Gulf," said Addison Armstrong of TFS Energy Futures in the United States. Oman produces just 715,000 barrels per day of oil, a small fraction of Saudi Arabia&#39;s almost 9 million bpd. Earlier in the day, oil prices had drawn continued support from output disruptions in Nigeria that have tightened supplies of gasoline-rich crude during peak summer demand. Investors also took note of a defiant statement by Iran&#39;s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He said , the world&#39;s fourth biggest oil exporter, would not retreat from the "field of danger" to protect its right to develop nuclear technology. In fellow OPEC member Nigeria, militants have called a one-month truce in attacks on oil installations in the Niger Delta. But analysts saw little to suggest an end to 18 months of violence that has shut about a third of Nigeria&#39;s oil output. "Nigeria is keeping the market quite tight," said Helen Henton, head of commodity research at Standard Chartered Bank. She noted the International Energy Agency has called repeatedly for the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production. "But OPEC is being quite strident about it being a U.S. refinery problem," she said. A series of outages at oil refineries in top oil consumer the United States have contributed to a supply bottleneck in U.S. gasoline supplies, which are lower than usual. Some refineries are now coming back onstream. Oil had surged to a nine-month high above &#36;71 on May 24, partly on concerns about Nigeria and U.S. gasoline. Dealers will remain on alert for any sign of hurricanes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico after the Atlantic basin storm season began on June 1, although the first system of the season to approach the region -- Tropical Storm Barry -- weakened by the weekend, pouring rain on Florida.

http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/cambodiaenvironment Cambodia bans damning report into illegal logging - Yahoo! News Cambodia bans damning report into illegal logging Sun Jun 3, 5:30 PM ET PHNOM PENH (AFP) - Cambodia on Sunday banned a damning report by an environmental group which accused the kingdom&#39;s political elite, including the premier&#39;s relatives, of illegally logging the nation&#39;s forests. The ministry of information said that they had asked the interior ministry to help them collect any copies of the Global Witness report, which was released in Bangkok on Friday. "It was a personal accusation ... to cause political conflicts in the country," the information ministry said in a statement. "It is nothing related to freedom of publication -- it was forbidden because people used the organisation&#39;s name to serve their political intentions," it added. Global Witness accused the political elite here of stripping the country of its natural resources, adding that relatives and business associates of Prime Minister Hun Sen and other top officials were acting "with complete impunity." The report said Cambodia&#39;s most powerful illegal logging syndicate was run by people linked to Hun Sen, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Chan Sarun and Ty Sokhun, the director-general of the forest administration.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/china_remembering_tiananmen Tiananmen Square survivors seek reform - Yahoo! News Tiananmen Square survivors seek reform By ANITA CHANG, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 56 minutes ago BEIJING - For the first time in 18 years, Ding Zilin marked the anniversary of her son's death with a visit to the place where he was shot amid a violent government crackdown on protests at Tiananmen Square. Police usually are quick to snuff out any memorials in Beijing for those killed in the crackdown that culminated in June 4, 1989, while China's government still calls the seven-week Tiananmen protest a counter-revolutionary riot and has yet to fully disclose what happened. But with China's human rights record under renewed scrutiny ahead of the 2008 Olympics, survivors of the bloody crackdown in Beijing marked the event's 18th anniversary on Monday by demanding political reform. And Ding, who for years was placed under house arrest during Tiananmen anniversaries and other sensitive times, wept on the eve of the anniversary as she placed a photo of her son on the spot where he died a few kilometers west of Tiananmen. "It's been 18 years and I felt like I let him down and let down the others who died with him," she said of her son, who was killed as he hid behind a flower bed from soldiers enforcing martial law on the night of June 3. He had turned 17 the day before. In Hong Kong on Monday &#151; the only place in China where a large, public commemoration is allowed &#151; tens of thousands gathered to mourn the dead at a candlelight vigil. In Beijing's Tiananmen Square, there were no immediate reports of protests and only tourists gathered to watch a daily flag-raising ceremony amid tight security. Ding, co-founder of the Tiananmen Mothers, a group that represents families of those who died, said police did not try to stop her Sunday night, though plainclothes agents may have been observing the vigil. "Right now, this is all I can do. Not getting justice for them, we're still pushing for it but there's been no response," said Ding, who has campaigned to get the government to acknowledge those killed in the crackdown and compensate their families. "Their spirits are obviously not at peace." Most of the surviving students who led the Tiananmen protests have drifted away from activism and into careers in business or other professions, but prominent student leader Wang Dan has continued to push for political reform in China as he pursues a doctorate in history at Harvard University. He said in a videotaped message that China's recent economic success cannot make up for the crackdown and killed hundreds, maybe thousands, of people. "Who can guarantee things that happened 18 years ago will not happen 18 years later?" Wang said. "Even if we become more powerful economically, China still cannot rise in international society." Another former student leader, Wu'er Kaixi, lamented that the memory of Tiananmen appears to be fading worldwide. "The Chinese government is unwilling to face the truth and seems to hope that the 'problem' of June 4 will simply go away," Wu'er, who has worked as a businessman and radio broadcaster in Taiwan, told The Associated Press. "For the most part, the world seems willing to go along with this." In the former British colony of Hong Kong, many residents in 1989 supported the Tiananmen protesters and the violence raised fears that the Communist leadership would not honor its promise to allow Hong Kong the civil liberties its people enjoyed under British rule. But 10 years after the hand-over, the city still enjoys freedoms that people on the mainland can only dream about. Street protests are common and the press frequently criticizes the government, though media watchdogs say self-censorship is common. A candlelight vigil Monday night filled up six soccer fields at Victoria Park near downtown Hong Kong. Amy Chan, 60, brought her 5-year-old granddaughter. "Although she is young, we need to let her know the history," Chan said. Tonny Chin, 50, a clerk, said he has attended the vigil every year since 1989. "The June fourth incident is a tragedy for China," he said. "We need to vindicate it." New York-based Human Rights Watch said Beijing's failure to account for the crackdown casts a pall on its campaign to project a new image ahead of the Olympics in 14 months. "Beijing &#151; and by extension, the 2008 &#151; will remain tarnished by this legacy until the Chinese government provides a complete and truthful account of what happened in June 1989," said Sophie Richardson, deputy Asia director of the human rights group.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/highestrated/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/global_warming_satellites U.S. cuts back climate checks from space - Yahoo! News U.S. cuts back climate checks from space By JOHN HEILPRIN, Associated Press Writer 2 hours, 55 minutes ago WASHINGTON - The Bush administration is drastically scaling back efforts to measure global warming from space, just as the president tries to convince the world the U.S. is ready to take the lead in reducing greenhouse gases. A confidential report to the White House, obtained by The Associated Press, warns that U.S. scientists will soon lose much of their ability to monitor warming from space using a costly and problem-plagued satellite initiative begun more than a decade ago. Because of technology glitches and a near-doubling in the original $6.5 billion cost, the Defense Department has decided to downsize and launch four satellites paired into two orbits, instead of six satellites and three orbits. The satellites were intended to gather weather and climate data, replacing existing satellites as they come to the end of their useful lifetimes beginning in the next couple of years. The reduced system of four satellites will now focus on weather forecasting. Most of the climate instruments needed to collect more precise data over long periods are being eliminated. and two partners &#151; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and &#151; will rely on European satellites for most of the climate data. "Unfortunately, the recent loss of climate sensors ... places the overall climate program in serious jeopardy," NOAA and NASA scientists told the White House in the Dec. 11 report obtained by the AP. They said they will face major gaps in data that can be collected only from satellites about ice caps and sheets, surface levels of seas and lakes, sizes of glaciers, surface radiation, water vapor, snow cover and atmospheric carbon dioxide. Rick Piltz, director of Climate Science Watch, a watchdog program of the Washington-based Government Accountability Project, called the situation a crisis. "We're going to start being blinded in our ability to observe the planet," said Piltz, whose group provided the AP with the previously undisclosed report. "It's criminal negligence, and the leaders in the climate science community are ringing the alarm bells on this crisis." Bush has repeatedly cited his administration's record on researching global warming as a response to criticism of his opposition to forced reductions in the greenhouse gases blamed for it. The administration has been spending about $5 billion a year on global warming: $2 billion on climate research and $3 billion on technologies for combatting it. Last week, the president proposed the idea of the 15 largest global-warming polluters &#151; the U.S. is the largest, followed closely by China &#151; meeting to set goals for fixing the problem while leaving it up to each nation just how to do it. The problem will be a major topic at this week's summit of world leaders in Europe. Bush requested $331 million for work on the scaled-back satellite system next year in his fiscal 2008 budget proposal. Congress has yet to act on it. The American Association for the Advancement of Science and the National Academy of Sciences National Academy of Sciences have both cautioned that downsizing the satellite program will result in major gaps in the continuity and quality of the data gathered about the Earth from space. NASA and NOAA agreed in April to restore sensors that will enable the satellites to map ozone. NOAA Administrator Conrad Lautenbacher said that would give scientists a better idea of the content and distribution of atmospheric gases. But seven other separate climate sensors are still being eliminated or substantially downgraded by lower-quality equipment to save money, according to the report to the White House. Most of the satellites, which were scheduled to launch starting next year, have been delayed to between 2013 and 2026. White House science adviser Jack Marburger, for whom the report was intended, acknowledged that climate scientists had been depending greatly on the planned satellites. "We're obviously very concerned about this," he told the AP. "It got in trouble and we couldn't fit all those instruments on it ... leaving us with a number of problems and questions: How do we maintain our momentum in this very important area of science?" NASA spokeswoman Tabatha Thompson told the AP a final version of the "impacts" report was delivered to Marburger on Jan. 8. It was not made public because it is "a pre-decisional document within the administration," she said. NASA and NOAA also are looking for guidance from the , which is holding a workshop on the satellites this month. Chet Koblinsky, director of NOAA's climate program office, told the council the satellites "represented the cornerstone of the nation's future space-based climate research program," according to PowerPoint slides obtained by AP. The delays were caused in part because of problems with an infrared sensor that officials either didn't monitor closely enough or didn't bring to the attention of their managers, the 's inspector general reported last year. That report also said a contractor on the project was receiving excessive fees. The National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System, or NPOESS, was first announced in 1994. It was an effort to combine weather-forecasting satellites operated by the Defense Department and NOAA and add climate data-gathering instruments. The plans also involved the European Organization for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites and the National Space Development Agency of Japan. By 2005, however, the , an investigative arm of Congress, found the costs for the U.S. satellites could run to $9.7 billion and were almost a year and a half behind schedule. The Pentagon last year pegged the cost at $11.5 billion and found that it was further behind schedule. Jerry Mahlman, a former scientist at NOAA who is now at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said he and other colleagues warned of problems as far back as 1995. He compared the preparations for the satellites to a "planned train wreck." AP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.
