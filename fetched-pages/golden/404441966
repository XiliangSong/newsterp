http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/opinion/31thu1.html Injustice 5, Justice 4 5, Justice 4 Supreme Court struck a blow for discrimination this week by stripping a key civil rights law of much of its potency. The majority opinion, by Justice Samuel Alito, forced an unreasonable reading on the law, and tossed aside longstanding precedents to rule in favor of an Alabama employer that had underpaid a female employee for years. The ruling is the latest indication that a court that once proudly stood up for the disadvantaged is increasingly protective of the powerful. Lilly Ledbetter, a supervisor at the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company in Gadsden, Ala., sued her employer for paying her less than its male supervisors. At first, her salary was in line with the men’s, but she got smaller raises, which created a significant pay gap. Late in her career, Ms. Ledbetter filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. A jury found that Goodyear violated her rights under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Goodyear argued that she filed her complaint too late and, by a 5-4 margin, the Supreme Court agreed. Title VII requires employees to file within 180 days of “the alleged unlawful employment practice.” The court calculated the deadline from the day Ms. Ledbetter received her last discriminatory raise. Bizarrely, the majority insisted it did not matter that Goodyear was still paying her far less than her male counterparts when she filed her complaint. In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg noted that there were strong precedents supporting Ms. Ledbetter. The Supreme Court ruled in a similar race discrimination case that each paycheck calculated on the basis of past discrimination is unlawful under Title VII. The courts of appeals have overwhelmingly agreed. So did the E.E.O.C., the agency charged with enforcing Title VII. In addition to interpreting the statute unreasonably and ignoring the relevant precedents, the majority blinded itself to the realities of the workplace. Employees generally do not know enough about what their co-workers earn, or how pay decisions are made, to file a complaint precisely when discrimination occurs. At Goodyear, as at many companies, salaries were confidential. The court’s new rules will make it extraordinarily difficult for victims of pay discrimination to sue under Title VII. That is not how Congress intended the law to be enforced, merely how five justices would like it to be. It is disturbing that Anthony Kennedy, the court’s swing justice, cast the deciding vote in favor of gutting a key part of the Civil Rights Act. Fortunately, Congress can amend the law to undo this damaging decision. It should do so without delay. to Hear Case on Wages Of Home Aides Court Explores Complexities In Job Discrimination Case Religion-Based Tax Breaks: Housing to Paychecks to Books Grasso Moves To Reinstate A Jury Trial Equal Employment Opportunity Commission The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/opinion/31thu4.html A Clean Start at the World Bank Clean Start at the World Bank how much better it would have been if President Bush had simply named Robert Zoellick to lead the World Bank two years ago instead of putting the bank, his administration and the world through the unnecessary and embarrassing Paul Wolfowitz ordeal. Now that Mr. Zoellick — far more qualified both in experience and temperament — has been nominated for the job, we hope that he will be quickly confirmed so that the bank’s professional staff can refocus its attention on the urgent jobs of combating poverty, promoting development and encouraging good governance. We also hope that Mr. Zoellick will not shy away from the important challenge of fighting corruption, a campaign that Mr. Wolfowitz embraced but then undermined through his own ethical obtuseness, in arranging a transfer and extraordinary pay raise for his companion. Good causes should not fall victim to bad appointments, once the offending actor has been removed and a strong replacement is waiting to take charge. Mr. Zoellick is just about everything Mr. Wolfowitz was not. He is an able diplomat, experienced and interested in the details of development, trade and governance and widely respected in the many countries he has dealt with in his long career as a top State Department official and as America’s top trade negotiator. Clientitis and outright corruption have historically been real problems at the bank — too many loans have been approved for no better reason than to keep the borrowing government happy and too few questions asked about how the bank’s money has actually been used. The bank lends some $23 billion a year to poor countries, and is currently trying to raise $30 billion to finance new loans to the poorest among them. It cannot go on asking taxpayers in the developed world to underwrite its activities without demanding transparent accounting and public accountability for how its money is used. Billions of the world’s neediest people live in countries too poor and too undeveloped to have access to commercial lending at market rates. Globalization cannot succeed if these countries continue to be left behind. Other countries that have managed to raise average incomes need the technical and managerial expertise the bank can provide. Two precious years have been largely wasted. Mr. Zoellick cannot get to work soon enough.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/opinion/31thu2.html Isolating an Evasive TB Patient an Evasive TB Patient has been more than 40 years since the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ordered anyone into quarantine or isolation, but the agency was amply justified in taking that extreme action in recent days. It was dealing with a patient infected with a very-hard-to-treat form of tuberculosis who had put his own convenience ahead of the safety of others. The only question is whether health officials should have acted sooner. The patient, who lives in the Atlanta area, has shown no overt symptoms, such as coughing up blood or sputum. But laboratory tests have confirmed that he is infected with “extensively drug resistant” bacteria, a form of TB that kills a high percentage of those infected around the world. The patient does not appear to be highly infectious, but he has the potential to threaten the lives of those who come into prolonged contact with him, especially those with compromised immune systems. The chief concern at the moment is people who sat near him on two trans-Atlantic flights. County health officials in Georgia say that they told the patient that he should not travel abroad. In an interview with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the patient, who has not been named, says he thought they were only expressing a preference and that they did not flat-out order him to cancel a planned wedding and honeymoon in Europe. He left before a written directive against travel could be hand-delivered. Only after the man was already in Europe did laboratory tests discover that his case was the most serious kind. Officials contacted him in Rome and told him not to fly commercial airlines and to await alternative travel arrangements or possible isolation and treatment in Italy. Instead, he and his new bride booked a flight into Canada to evade a possible no-fly list and drove down to New York, where the C.D.C. finally coaxed them to a hospital and slapped an isolation order on him before transferring him by government plane back to Georgia. Health officials have long preferred to rely on infected people to behave responsibly rather than resort to compulsory orders. But in this case, that trust was clearly abused. Congressional oversight committees ought to examine whether health officials dropped the ball — and what steps can be taken to ensure that patients infected with deadly contagious diseases protect others from infection.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/opinion/31thu3.html The Continuing Saga of SIPP Continuing Saga of SIPP year ago, the Bush administration decided to kill what is arguably the single most important survey on the effects of government programs on Americans’ lives. In a rare and welcome reversal, the administration has heeded the protest of policy experts and Congress and has decided to continue the project, known as SIPP, or Survey of Income and Program Participation. Conducted by the Census Bureau since 1984, the survey provides much of what policy makers and the public know about the success or failure of government efforts to address poverty, health insurance and the problems of working families and the disabled. It is especially useful in projecting the impact of proposed changes in government policy. On welfare-to-work programs, the SIPP has identified why some people move successfully into jobs while others revert to chronic unemployment. Having a disabled child, for instance, is a big reason that many women can’t hold a job. If the goal is to move more women into work, that suggests the need for appropriate child care. On health insurance coverage, the survey has tracked individuals over long periods of time, revealing a truer picture of the number of uninsured Americans and the causes of on-and-off coverage, information that is necessary to properly define the problem — and solve it. Policy experts, in and out of government, worked to save the SIPP. They made the case that the administration’s proposed replacement survey was untested and that even if it ultimately proved adequate, would not be ready anytime soon, thus creating an information void for several years. Having realized how important the SIPP is, the administration must now secure its full funding. When the White House developed its budget for 2008, it was planning on ending the survey and did not allocate any funds for it. Lawmakers could add the $35 million that is needed, but the White House has threatened to veto spending that exceeds its recommended levels. The administration should officially modify its budget request to ensure that the SIPP is fully funded. The information is too valuable to forgo. States Politics and Government

When it comes to sounds and songs, these animals behave in mysterious ways. Consider the beautiful music that whales make, which became known to us 37 years ago when “Songs of the Humpback Whale” was released — and went on to become one of the best-selling nature recordings of all time. The whales’ long, drawn-out melodies thunder on, loudly enough to be heard underwater for a distance of at least 10 miles. Five- to 20-minute songs — marked by repeating phrases, rhythm and even rhyme — are sung over and over for hours on end. Because only the males sing, scientists long assumed that their songs were mating calls directed at females — like bird song in spring. But observation of humpback whale behavior has revealed that females actually pay no attention to the males’ singing. Other explanations have been proposed: that males sing to warn other males away, for example, or that the songs act as some kind of beacon to help migrating whales navigate. The most recent theory on why whales sing comes from James Darling, a researcher who for many years has carefully observed the interactions of singing humpback whales near Maui, Hawaii. Mr. Darling has observed that males singing alone usually will join up with another male for a brief but almost always friendly, or at least conflict-free, interaction. And so he thinks it is likely that male whales sing to one another. During breeding, their songs somehow may help them to cooperate, and to recognize their closest male associates. Whale song has another unexplained aspect that no bird song possesses. Across a single breeding ground, and in some cases across the reach of an ocean basin as large as the North Pacific, the whales all sing essentially the same tune. And as the season progresses, they collectively revise it, adding new melodies and taking others away. Over several mating seasons, songs are entirely changed. (Today’s humpbacks would not recognize the music on “Songs of the Humpback Whale” from 1970.) The whales evolve their common songs simultaneously even though some of them are much too far apart from one another to hear the changes at the same time. How do they know what new notes to choose? What guides the changes they make? Scientists don’t know, and hardly know how to find out. Because the whales that were in the Sacramento River are females, whale songs probably would not have lured them downstream. So marine biologists tried playing feeding calls. This strategy worked 22 years ago when Humphrey, another humpback, was stuck in the same river. This time, it didn’t work. It’s not easy to tell great whales what to do; it is even harder to figure out what drives them. But it is encouraging to see how many people have rallied round the cause of this stranded family. There may be a reason whales have been drawn more than once to swim miles up this particular river. The more we observe them, the more we may learn. David Rothenberg, a professor of philosophy and music at the New Jersey Institute of Technology, is the author of “Why Birds Sing” and the forthcoming “Thousand Mile Song: Whale Music in a Sea of Sound.”
