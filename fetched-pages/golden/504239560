Mr. Bush’s curriculum coordinates with both the standards movement sweeping states and its national embodiment, which requires all children 8 to be tested each year in reading and math, and once in science. Some educators have criticized Mr. Bush for using his brother’s law to market his product.

In a recent interview in Washington, Mr. Bush said he had not lobbied for business through his connections to President Bush. “We have a very strict policy of having no interface with any agency of the federal government,” he said.

The lessons are devised to match the standards in many states, and the company is working on a math curriculum. Mr. Bush said his curriculum made social studies and science more accessible. “Middle schools use 19th-century technologies to teach 21st-century kids,” he said. “Textbooks honestly have failed middle school children. They rely on children’s ability to read, and they’re boring.” Mr. Bush said he began the business with no experience in pedagogy or software development.

(Mr. Bush’s curriculum was not studied.) Todd Oppenheimer, the author of a 2003 book, “The Flickering Mind: The False Promise of Technology in the Classroom and How Learning Can Be Saved,” said the worth of computerized instruction depended on how it was used and how much it spurred inquiry. “To what extent does the software elaborate and open up academic exploration, and to what extent does it narrow it down, regiment it and standardize it?” he asked. “If it’s in the first category, it’s possibly good. If it’s in the second category, it’s more than likely bad.” Classrooms here in Spotsylvania are participating in a study that will test whether children using the COWs do better on the state exams than those not using them.

Few of their parents went to college. Skip to next paragraph Greg Sailor for Jones teaches science at the academy. Greg Sailor for Hennessey is the principal of the Dayton Early College Academy. Budget cuts may force the school to change its structure. &#147;For us to lose teachers would be catastrophic,&#148; Ms. Hennessey says. But every member of the graduating class, the school’s first, will attend college in the fall on the strength of their academic achievements and $2 million in scholarship offers, a remarkable success story in a school district plagued by budget shortfalls and challenges endemic to urban schools. That success, however, may not be enough to save the experimental public high school. Voters rejected a school tax levy on May 8, forcing the school district to cut $30 million from its budget. That could result in the academy’s reverting to a more traditional model. With more than 200 layoffs planned in the district, many of the teachers who have developed the academy’s curriculum through trial and error are likely to lose their jobs to teachers with more experience because the teachers’ union requires layoffs to be made according to seniority. Some positions would probably be eliminated. “For us to lose teachers would be catastrophic,” said Judy Hennessey, who resigned as superintendent of the affluent school district in nearby Oakwood to become principal of the academy, which has 225 students who are required to begin taking college-level courses by their junior or senior year. The school, which is in an office building owned by the University of Dayton, was founded and operated in part with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the KnowledgeWorks Foundation, based in Cincinnati. Some supporters want to convert the academy into a charter school, which would free it from dealing with the teachers’ union and help it retain its staff. The student-teacher ratio at the academy is 14 to 1, compared with the district average of 33 to 1, Ms. Hennessey said. who is speaker of the Ohio House and whose district includes the academy, said he was willing to sponsor a bill allowing it to become a charter school if the teachers’ union does not exempt the academy from layoffs by seniority. “I want them to keep this as part of the public system,” Mr. Husted said, “but if they’re unwilling to do that, I think preserving the school is more important.” Patricia Lynch, the president of the teachers’ union, was on the planning committee that formed the school but said it could not be exempt from cuts. “There are going to be setbacks in every school,” Ms. Lynch said. Thomas J. Lasley II, the dean of the School of Education at the University of Dayton and a founder of the academy, said the school and others like it were desperately needed. “If you’re going to educate urban kids, you’re going to need niche places,” Dr. Lasley said. “We can’t be losing this much intellectual capital and expect cities like Dayton to survive too long.” Away from the financing tug of war, the graduating students were ebullient. Jerusha Clark, 18, graduated with a diploma and an associate’s degree in liberal arts. She has enrolled at Mars Hill College near Asheville, N.C., majoring in pre-med biology. Kasandra Maxwell, 18, will study engineering at the University of Dayton. Other students, like Shaina Moore, a 16-year-old sophomore, hope the school continues untouched next year. Ms. Moore’s mother died in 1999, and her grandmother, who became her guardian, suffered from alcohol abuse, she said. Ms. Moore went into foster care and missed 100 school days in fifth grade in a downward spiral she worried might never end. With the help of her great-aunt and great-uncle, who became her guardians in 2001, she found her footing and has since blossomed at the academy. “I started out struggling my first year,” she said. “Now that I’m acquainted, I feel like it’s my second home.” Ms. Moore loves the language arts, she said, especially persuasive writing. She hopes to use her powers of persuasion as a probation officer to help people set their lives straight.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/world/europe/31britain.html British Academics&#8217; Union Endorses Israel Boycott Academics’ Union Endorses Israel Boycott 2007 LONDON, May 30 &#151; The main union representing 120,000 British college teachers voted Wednesday to endorse a Palestinian trades&#8217; union call for a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. The boycott resolution, approved at the inaugural congress of the University and College Union, called on British college lecturers to &#8220;consider the moral implications of existing and proposed links with Israeli academic institutions.&#8221; In theory, a boycott could sever academic contacts and exchanges of personnel between British and Israeli academic institutions. The union leaders insisted, though, that rules endorsed in a separate resolution earlier on Wednesday would forestall any immediate moves toward any action of that kind. The pro-boycott ballot, on a count of 158 to 99, according to a rough tabulation by boycott opponents present at the voting, was the first since the merger of two leading associations of higher education teachers last year. Under union procedures, the resolution approved Wednesday will be circulated among ordinary members. The rules also lay down a series of criteria to be met before any action is taken to enforce a boycott. Delegates at the gathering in Bournemouth, a southern seaside town, seemed to have ignored an appeal by union leaders to take a softer line. Sally Hunt, the union&#8217;s general secretary, said in a statement after the vote: &#8220;As I have made clear in the past, and as I reiterated on the floor of congress this morning, I do not believe a boycott is supported by the majority of U.C.U. members, nor do I believe that members see it is a priority for the union.&#8221; &#8220;Today&#8217;s motion on boycott means all branches now have a responsibility to consult all of their members on the issue, and I believe that every member should have the opportunity to have their say. The earlier motion means that any future calls for a boycott must pass key tests before a boycott can be implemented.&#8221; The ballot nonetheless drew sharp protests from an assembly of British Jewish groups and Israeli groups that had banded together to oppose a boycott. The coalition said in a statement that the vote represented &#8220;an attack on academic exchange which undermines the values of equality and freedom which ought to be fundamental to all British academic institutions.&#8221; Jeremy Newmark, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, said the decision &#8220;damages the credibility of British academia as a whole.&#8221; &#8217;s Bar-Ilan University, who had managed a booth at the conference called &#8220;Meet Israeli Academia,&#8221; said it was &#8220;very disturbing to behold this form of singling out and discrimination happening in the U.K., which upholds itself as the cradle of fairness, freedom of speech and academic debate.&#8221; The resolution condemned what it called &#8220;the complicity of Israeli academia&#8221; in the occupation of Palestinian lands and said &#8220;passivity or neutrality is unacceptable, and criticism of Israel cannot be construed as anti-Semitic.&#8221; On the same day the resolution was approved, however, the presidents of four Israeli universities &#151; Ben-Gurion University, Hebrew University, Haifa University and the Technion &#151; joined with authors including Amos Oz and David Grossman in urging the Israeli defense establishment to end a ban that prevents Palestinian students from traveling from Gaza to the West Bank to study. Their announcement made reference to the consideration of a boycott by the British union.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/nyregion/30yale.html Man Posed as Yale Aide in Swindle of Irish Immigrants, Authorities Say Posed as Yale Aide in Swindle of Irish Immigrants, Authorities Say On the day of his arrest in Manhattan, Ralph Cucciniello, 55, on a video from a private investigator who had been contacted by an immigrant. 2007 NEW HAVEN, May 29 — It sounded good enough to be a dream come true, yet practical enough to be possible. The illegal Irish immigrants were eager to get their papers, and someone at Yale Law School was eager to help them. The process seemed simple and straightforward: file some paperwork, get a medical exam and be fingerprinted. Write a check for $5,000. Ralph Cucciniello at the Yale Law Clinic would take care of the rest. But there is no such thing as the Yale Immigration Law Clinic. Mr. Cucciniello, according to university officials and law enforcement authorities, was not a lawyer, but a research assistant with prior convictions on fraud charges who was running an extensive swindle out of the Yale Law School library. Over the last two years, the authorities say, he collected millions of dollars from at least 200 illegal immigrants and provided nothing in return. He was arrested on May 1 in Manhattan on charges of a scheme to defraud and grand larceny. The charges were filed many of the immigrants live there and because Mr. Cucciniello is accused of collecting some of the payments there. Prosecutors in Connecticut are also investigating the case. “He had Yale attached to his name; what more could we ask for?” said Donald, 33, who, like others who say they sent Mr. Cucciniello money, did not give his last name because he is in the country illegally. “Everything he did had a purpose. He played it all just like a lawyer.” Mr. Cucciniello, 55, who was released on his own recognizance, is scheduled to appear in court on Aug. 15. His lawyer, George Goltzer, declined to discuss the case on Tuesday. It is not clear exactly how Mr. Cucciniello obtained a university e-mail address and access to law school buildings. Jan Conroy, a spokeswoman for the law school, said that Mr. Cucciniello had never been an employee of the university, but that he had “on occasion served as a volunteer research assistant for a particular professor at the law school.” “He has not been authorized by the law school or the clinics to undertake any activities or to represent any clients,” Ms. Conroy said in a statement. “Upon learning of his arrest, the law school suspended his access to all law school facilities.” Ms. Conroy would not say which professor Mr. Cucciniello worked for, but said the research was not for any project directly related to the law school. A private investigator working for the immigrants who had paid Mr. Cucciniello identified the professor, who did not respond to telephone messages left on Tuesday. Like other law schools, Yale runs several law clinics staffed by students, including one that works on behalf of illegal immigrants trying to seek asylum and another that focuses on human rights violations. The Yale reputation was all Mr. Cucciniello needed to establish his credibility. Many of the well-off Irish immigrants who paid Mr. Cucciniello travel in the same social circles, and routinely assured one another that they were getting the right treatment from a bright assistant at one of the finest universities in America. They never suspected anything was awry until the news of Mr. Cucciniello’s arrest was reported in The Irish Voice this month. Several immigrants said he had his story worked out smoothly. He would explain over the telephone or via e-mail that he had set up the clinic on behalf of the law school dean and was using a loophole through the Department of Homeland Security to obtain green cards for people here illegally. Typically, he would summon the immigrants to a desk or office in the Yale Law School library, where he conducted extensive interviews, asking about everything from parking tickets to bank-account balances. He warned them that once they were issued green cards, the federal government would probably try to collect back taxes, perhaps as a way to prepare them to hand over more money down the road, the immigrants said. After directing them to complete several government forms, Mr. Cucciniello would say it would take several months for the government to run a background check. He would routinely call, the immigrants said, to update them on the progress of their case or ask for more details. And each time, he would begin the conversation with an official-sounding disclaimer: This conversation is protected by attorney-client privilege. Everything you say will be kept private. He reassured them that while the process was often long, it was progressing smoothly.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/education/31schools.html Test Program in Schools Test Program in Schools 2007 announced yesterday that the city school system would spend $80 million over five years on a battery of new standardized tests to begin this fall for most 1.1 million public school students. The contract awarded to the testing giant CTB/McGraw-Hill will involve a significant expansion of exams, known as periodic tests, which monitor students&#8217; progress and are supposed to help predict how students will perform in the annual state exams. Mr. Klein&#8217;s announcement immediately rekindled the debate over whether such testing is emphasized too much or is even a useful tool for teachers. Pupils 8 will be tested five times a year in both reading and math, instead of three times as they are now. High school students, for the first time, will be tested four times a year in each subject. In the next few years, the tests will expand to include science and social studies. The test results will not be used for decisions on promoting teachers, whether they should be granted tenure, or how to grade schools, Mr. Klein said at an afternoon news conference. He called them a way to spot students who are falling behind. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it means more pressure,&#8221; Mr. Klein said. &#8220;I think it means more learning.&#8221; He said the present testing regime was &#8220;too intermittent&#8221; to help teachers judge progress. The annual state exams 8 are used to measure a school&#8217;s performance in meeting requirements of the federal law. Under the law, schools that fail to show adequate yearly progress face potential penalties. Few major cities administer standardized tests as frequently as five times a year, several education experts said, and the move instantly drew criticism from the array of groups that have mobilized against the growing reliance on standardized tests that has accompanied the law. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly more than any other city than I know of,&#8221; said Monty Neill, an executive director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing in Boston, which is skeptical of standardized testing. &#8220;We&#8217;ve reduced schooling to preparing for bubble tests.&#8221; , the president of the United Federation of Teachers , said in an interview that many teachers say they already spend at least one day a week preparing for standardized tests. &#8220;Our issue is, how much teaching time is this eating up?&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re spending a lot of time doing test prep and doing paperwork associated with test prep instead of teaching.&#8221; She added that it would be illegal for the city to use the tests to advance or slow the careers of teachers. In Chicago, a city whose public schools rely heavily on periodic testing, students 8 are tested three times a year, said Linda Bendixen, a spokeswoman for the Chicago public schools. A small but expanding group of high schools are tested four times a year, she added. Michael Casserly, the executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools in Washington, a lobbying group for large urban school systems, said such testing of elementary schoolchildren has become more common. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a growing trend for at least the last five to seven years,&#8221; Mr. Casserly said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s more unusual for cities to use interim tests at the high school level. New York is breaking some new ground on that front.&#8221; City Education Department officials said the exams would make teachers&#8217; jobs easier, giving them the ability to produce instant results and help pinpoint which students are falling behind. The tests are devised to be taken in a typical 45-minute class period, either online or using the traditional pencil and paper. Teachers will be able to draw from a bank of questions to customize the tests to their own curriculum, choosing from a mix of multiple choice or open-ended questions. The results for tests taken online will be available immediately, and for pencil and paper tests, the results will arrive in five days. Principals will then be able to analyze the data to better understand how students perform and what teachers can do to help them, city officials said. James Liebman, the chief accountability officer for the Education Department, said, &#8220;This gives us the capacity to hone in and figure out where the problems are.&#8221; Mr. Casserly, of the Council of the Great City Schools, said he has seen the tests used to good effect in some school districts. &#8220;They can be helpful and useful when they&#8217;re well designed, and when they yield good data that teachers know how to interpret, and where there&#8217;s follow-up and support,&#8221; he said. He said, however, that he had also seen disastrous results. Jane R. Hirschmann, of Time Out From Testing, a statewide group that has argued against standardized tests, said she believes that the curriculum in schools is being driven by the tests. &#8220;Now the whole city system is based on test prep and test taking,&#8221; she said. CIT/McGraw-Hill is one of the major sources of standardized tests and is a provider standardized exams. Previously, the city had a contract for periodic testing with The Princeton Review, better known for preparing students for exams for college and graduate school admissions.

Skip to next paragraph Education Spending, State by State Nationwide, public school districts spent an average of $8,701 per student on elementary and secondary education in the 2005 fiscal year, 5 percent more than in the previous year. New York, which also came in highest last year, spent $14,119 per student, followed by New Jersey at $13,800, Vermont at $11,838 and Connecticut at $11,572. The census found sharp regional disparities in raw spending but made no adjustment for local cost-of-living differences. Seven of the 10 states that spent the most per pupil were in the Northeast; all 10 that spent the least were in the West or the South. Utah ranked last, at $5,257, followed by Arizona ($6,281), Idaho ($6,283), Mississippi ($6,575) and Oklahoma ($6,613). Over all, public school systems spent $497 billion, compared to $472 billion the year before. About 60 percent of their $427 billion operating budgets was spent on instruction, with more than 9 percent allocated for operation and maintenance, 7 percent for administration and 4 percent for pupil transportation. The census reported wide differences by state in the proportion of school revenue raised by each level of government and how the money was spent. (Alaska led in the share from the federal government; Hawaii in the proportion from the state). When states were ranked by school spending as a percentage of personal income, Arkansas’ proportion was the highest, followed by Vermont, West Virginia, New Jersey and New York. In many states, local school districts showed sharp variations in spending per pupil. New York City, the nation’s largest school district, reported spending $13,755 per pupil, compared with $15,529 in New Rochelle. Nationwide, school systems spent nearly $42 billion on construction, with California and Texas, the two most populous states, accounting for almost one-third.

The census reported wide differences by state in the proportion of school revenue raised by each level of government and how the money was spent. (Alaska led in the share from the federal government; Hawaii in the proportion from the state). When states were ranked by school spending as a percentage of personal income, Arkansas’ proportion was the highest, followed by Vermont, West Virginia, New Jersey and New York. In many states, local school districts showed sharp variations in spending per pupil. New York City, the nation’s largest school district, reported spending $13,755 per pupil, compared with $15,529 in New Rochelle. Nationwide, school systems spent nearly $42 billion on construction, with California and Texas, the two most populous states, accounting for almost one-third.

The illegal Irish immigrants were eager to get their papers, and someone at Yale Law School was eager to help them. The process seemed simple and straightforward: file some paperwork, get a medical exam and be fingerprinted. Write a check for $5,000. Ralph Cucciniello at the Yale Law Clinic would take care of the rest. But there is no such thing as the Yale Immigration Law Clinic. Mr. Cucciniello, according to university officials and law enforcement authorities, was not a lawyer, but a research assistant with prior convictions on fraud charges who was running an extensive swindle out of the Yale Law School library. Over the last two years, the authorities say, he collected millions of dollars from at least 200 illegal immigrants and provided nothing in return. He was arrested on May 1 in Manhattan on charges of a scheme to defraud and grand larceny. The charges were filed many of the immigrants live there and because Mr. Cucciniello is accused of collecting some of the payments there. Prosecutors in Connecticut are also investigating the case. “He had Yale attached to his name; what more could we ask for?” said Donald, 33, who, like others who say they sent Mr. Cucciniello money, did not give his last name because he is in the country illegally. “Everything he did had a purpose. He played it all just like a lawyer.” Mr. Cucciniello, 55, who was released on his own recognizance, is scheduled to appear in court on Aug. 15. His lawyer, George Goltzer, declined to discuss the case on Tuesday. It is not clear exactly how Mr. Cucciniello obtained a university e-mail address and access to law school buildings. Jan Conroy, a spokeswoman for the law school, said that Mr. Cucciniello had never been an employee of the university, but that he had “on occasion served as a volunteer research assistant for a particular professor at the law school.” “He has not been authorized by the law school or the clinics to undertake any activities or to represent any clients,” Ms. Conroy said in a statement. “Upon learning of his arrest, the law school suspended his access to all law school facilities.” Ms. Conroy would not say which professor Mr. Cucciniello worked for, but said the research was not for any project directly related to the law school. A private investigator working for the immigrants who had paid Mr. Cucciniello identified the professor, who did not respond to telephone messages left on Tuesday. Like other law schools, Yale runs several law clinics staffed by students, including one that works on behalf of illegal immigrants trying to seek asylum and another that focuses on human rights violations. The Yale reputation was all Mr. Cucciniello needed to establish his credibility. Many of the well-off Irish immigrants who paid Mr. Cucciniello travel in the same social circles, and routinely assured one another that they were getting the right treatment from a bright assistant at one of the finest universities in America. They never suspected anything was awry until the news of Mr. Cucciniello’s arrest was reported in The Irish Voice this month. Several immigrants said he had his story worked out smoothly. He would explain over the telephone or via e-mail that he had set up the clinic on behalf of the law school dean and was using a loophole through the Department of Homeland Security to obtain green cards for people here illegally. Typically, he would summon the immigrants to a desk or office in the Yale Law School library, where he conducted extensive interviews, asking about everything from parking tickets to bank-account balances. He warned them that once they were issued green cards, the federal government would probably try to collect back taxes, perhaps as a way to prepare them to hand over more money down the road, the immigrants said. After directing them to complete several government forms, Mr. Cucciniello would say it would take several months for the government to run a background check. He would routinely call, the immigrants said, to update them on the progress of their case or ask for more details. And each time, he would begin the conversation with an official-sounding disclaimer: This conversation is protected by attorney-client privilege. Everything you say will be kept private. He reassured them that while the process was often long, it was progressing smoothly.

The boycott resolution, approved at the inaugural congress of the University and College Union, called on British college lecturers to &#8220;consider the moral implications of existing and proposed links with Israeli academic institutions.&#8221; In theory, a boycott could sever academic contacts and exchanges of personnel between British and Israeli academic institutions. The union leaders insisted, though, that rules endorsed in a separate resolution earlier on Wednesday would forestall any immediate moves toward any action of that kind. The pro-boycott ballot, on a count of 158 to 99, according to a rough tabulation by boycott opponents present at the voting, was the first since the merger of two leading associations of higher education teachers last year. Under union procedures, the resolution approved Wednesday will be circulated among ordinary members. The rules also lay down a series of criteria to be met before any action is taken to enforce a boycott. Delegates at the gathering in Bournemouth, a southern seaside town, seemed to have ignored an appeal by union leaders to take a softer line. Sally Hunt, the union&#8217;s general secretary, said in a statement after the vote: &#8220;As I have made clear in the past, and as I reiterated on the floor of congress this morning, I do not believe a boycott is supported by the majority of U.C.U. members, nor do I believe that members see it is a priority for the union.&#8221; &#8220;Today&#8217;s motion on boycott means all branches now have a responsibility to consult all of their members on the issue, and I believe that every member should have the opportunity to have their say. The earlier motion means that any future calls for a boycott must pass key tests before a boycott can be implemented.&#8221; The ballot nonetheless drew sharp protests from an assembly of British Jewish groups and Israeli groups that had banded together to oppose a boycott. The coalition said in a statement that the vote represented &#8220;an attack on academic exchange which undermines the values of equality and freedom which ought to be fundamental to all British academic institutions.&#8221; Jeremy Newmark, chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council, said the decision &#8220;damages the credibility of British academia as a whole.&#8221; &#8217;s Bar-Ilan University, who had managed a booth at the conference called &#8220;Meet Israeli Academia,&#8221; said it was &#8220;very disturbing to behold this form of singling out and discrimination happening in the U.K., which upholds itself as the cradle of fairness, freedom of speech and academic debate.&#8221; The resolution condemned what it called &#8220;the complicity of Israeli academia&#8221; in the occupation of Palestinian lands and said &#8220;passivity or neutrality is unacceptable, and criticism of Israel cannot be construed as anti-Semitic.&#8221; On the same day the resolution was approved, however, the presidents of four Israeli universities &#151; Ben-Gurion University, Hebrew University, Haifa University and the Technion &#151; joined with authors including Amos Oz and David Grossman in urging the Israeli defense establishment to end a ban that prevents Palestinian students from traveling from Gaza to the West Bank to study. Their announcement made reference to the consideration of a boycott by the British union.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/education/31schools.html?ex=1338264000&en=a96ba127f6542b24&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Test Program in Schools Test Program in Schools 2007 announced yesterday that the city school system would spend $80 million over five years on a battery of new standardized tests to begin this fall for most 1.1 million public school students. The contract awarded to the testing giant CTB/McGraw-Hill will involve a significant expansion of exams, known as periodic tests, which monitor students&#8217; progress and are supposed to help predict how students will perform in the annual state exams. Mr. Klein&#8217;s announcement immediately rekindled the debate over whether such testing is emphasized too much or is even a useful tool for teachers. Pupils 8 will be tested five times a year in both reading and math, instead of three times as they are now. High school students, for the first time, will be tested four times a year in each subject. In the next few years, the tests will expand to include science and social studies. The test results will not be used for decisions on promoting teachers, whether they should be granted tenure, or how to grade schools, Mr. Klein said at an afternoon news conference. He called them a way to spot students who are falling behind. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think it means more pressure,&#8221; Mr. Klein said. &#8220;I think it means more learning.&#8221; He said the present testing regime was &#8220;too intermittent&#8221; to help teachers judge progress. The annual state exams 8 are used to measure a school&#8217;s performance in meeting requirements of the federal law. Under the law, schools that fail to show adequate yearly progress face potential penalties. Few major cities administer standardized tests as frequently as five times a year, several education experts said, and the move instantly drew criticism from the array of groups that have mobilized against the growing reliance on standardized tests that has accompanied the law. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly more than any other city than I know of,&#8221; said Monty Neill, an executive director of the National Center for Fair and Open Testing in Boston, which is skeptical of standardized testing. &#8220;We&#8217;ve reduced schooling to preparing for bubble tests.&#8221; , the president of the United Federation of Teachers , said in an interview that many teachers say they already spend at least one day a week preparing for standardized tests. &#8220;Our issue is, how much teaching time is this eating up?&#8221; she said. &#8220;You&#8217;re spending a lot of time doing test prep and doing paperwork associated with test prep instead of teaching.&#8221; She added that it would be illegal for the city to use the tests to advance or slow the careers of teachers. In Chicago, a city whose public schools rely heavily on periodic testing, students 8 are tested three times a year, said Linda Bendixen, a spokeswoman for the Chicago public schools. A small but expanding group of high schools are tested four times a year, she added. Michael Casserly, the executive director of the Council of the Great City Schools in Washington, a lobbying group for large urban school systems, said such testing of elementary schoolchildren has become more common. &#8220;It&#8217;s been a growing trend for at least the last five to seven years,&#8221; Mr. Casserly said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s more unusual for cities to use interim tests at the high school level. New York is breaking some new ground on that front.&#8221; City Education Department officials said the exams would make teachers&#8217; jobs easier, giving them the ability to produce instant results and help pinpoint which students are falling behind. The tests are devised to be taken in a typical 45-minute class period, either online or using the traditional pencil and paper. Teachers will be able to draw from a bank of questions to customize the tests to their own curriculum, choosing from a mix of multiple choice or open-ended questions. The results for tests taken online will be available immediately, and for pencil and paper tests, the results will arrive in five days. Principals will then be able to analyze the data to better understand how students perform and what teachers can do to help them, city officials said. James Liebman, the chief accountability officer for the Education Department, said, &#8220;This gives us the capacity to hone in and figure out where the problems are.&#8221; Mr. Casserly, of the Council of the Great City Schools, said he has seen the tests used to good effect in some school districts. &#8220;They can be helpful and useful when they&#8217;re well designed, and when they yield good data that teachers know how to interpret, and where there&#8217;s follow-up and support,&#8221; he said. He said, however, that he had also seen disastrous results. Jane R. Hirschmann, of Time Out From Testing, a statewide group that has argued against standardized tests, said she believes that the curriculum in schools is being driven by the tests. &#8220;Now the whole city system is based on test prep and test taking,&#8221; she said. CIT/McGraw-Hill is one of the major sources of standardized tests and is a provider standardized exams. Previously, the city had a contract for periodic testing with The Princeton Review, better known for preparing students for exams for college and graduate school admissions.
