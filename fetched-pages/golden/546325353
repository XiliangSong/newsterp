http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/dining/30holi.html by Seymour Chwast are, each and every one of us, standing together on the threshold of National Surimi Seafood Month. June is also the month to celebrate papayas, iced tea, frozen yogurt, candy, soul food, steakhouses and applesauce cake. And whether you eat turkeys or simply admire them, prepare to party. June is Turkey Lovers’ Month, too. by Seymour Chwast At least 175 days a year are set aside in recognition of some form of food or drink. This puts a lot of pressure on the average eater. The week of July 15 alone starts with Tapioca Day, moves into Fresh Spinach Day, National Caviar Day and National Daiquiri Day, and ends with National Junk Food Day. Most food holidays didn’t spring from a spontaneous national outpouring of passion for, say, lunchmeat (Bologna Day is Oct. 24, by the way). Unlike Mother’s Day, which sprung from early anti-war efforts, National Crown Roast of Pork Day (March 7) has no political underpinnings. National Frozen Food Month (also in March) does not have the religious or cultural framework of Valentine’s Day. Although most elected officials will happily declare a food holiday when a trade association or commodity group asks, the proclamations don’t really mean much. Schools and banks do not close for National Vinegar Day (June 16). No, most food holidays are invented by people who want to sell more food. Bake for Family Fun Month, bless its heart, appears dedicated to preserving a meaningful ritual of the kitchen during February. That may well happen, but the holiday also benefits its sponsor, an association of companies that sell flour, butter and home baking equipment. So many food holidays can be hard to keep track of. There are almost two dozen dessert days, a number that begs for comparisons. Is National Sacher Torte Day bigger than Spongecake Day? Or are both kicked to the curb by National Butterscotch Pudding Day? (Sept. 19, if you’re planning ahead.) Food holidays can highlight gross injustice. Consider the sandwich category. Egg salad gets a week in April, but the peanut butter and jelly — clearly the more enduring American sandwich — has only a day (April 2). Nowhere are the holidays more unevenly distributed than among the fruits. Is it fair, for example, that raisins and figs get only a week each, but peaches have an entire month (July)? And peaches have nothing on apples, which get three months (September through November), with special break-out days for specific varieties. (Eat a Red Apple Day comes, inexplicably, on Dec. 1.) Blame seniority. Apple Week is one of the earliest food holidays. It began in 1904. By the 1970s, the week became a month, and by the 1990s the apple celebration had grown to three months, said Kay Rentzel, director of the U.S. Apple Association’s national apple month program. Apple sales jump by as much as 25 percent during the promotion, Ms. Rentzel said. Last year 5,550 retailers received certificates from Ms. Rentzel’s office for participating. “They may have special apple events that go on or they may have special signage in their store,” she said. “Some stores will do a baking contest. It’s a pretty exciting time.” Often, a commodity group looking to popularize a food holiday will wrangle a government official to help. Three years ago, the California Wine Institute convinced Gov. to declare September California Wine Month. It’s not the only food holiday he likes. Mr. Schwarzenegger declared July California Wild King Salmon Month and January California Dried Plum Digestive Health Month. But prunes and cabernet don’t need the governor’s blessing. In the loosely organized world of food holidays, nothing is really required for legitimacy. One could simply decide that Sept. 12 is Ropa Vieja Day and hope that a blogger somewhere picks it up and gives it some traction. For serious students of the genre, there is something of an authority: Chase’s Calendar of Events, 750 pages of notable birthdays, community happenings and holidays. If someone develops an idea for, say, Bread Pudding Recipe Exchange Week (May 1-7) and submits a form found in the back of the book, it will be considered for inclusion. Chase’s has standards, and not every proposal makes the cut. An organization has to agree to sponsor the holiday, or there has to be some sort of ongoing promotion or tangible enthusiasm for it, said Holly McGuire, who edits the book in Chicago.

You go to a restaurant as a family, are seated and given menus, and the waitress cheerfully turns to your children and exclaims, “And these are for you!” Their own special menus — kids’ menus! Sometimes these are little laminated things, peewee facsimiles of what Mom and Dad are holding. Sometimes these are placemats that not only tell you what foods are available but also contain mazes and word-search puzzles. do you think of the children’s menu? Evan Sung for customers dining from the children's menu at Landmarc at the Time Warner Center. Above, Nicolas Salas. No matter what, the menu offers chicken fingers with French fries. And typically, as you go down the list, macaroni and cheese, a hot dog, a hamburger, grilled cheese and some kind of pizza. Early in my tenure as a parent, I thought children’s menus were the greatest thing, a quantum leap forward in the human condition. We didn’t have them when I was a child, at least not at restaurants where adults would be happy to dine. (There were always “family” restaurants in the Friendly’s-HoJo’s idiom that offered junior sundaes and burgers.) I was thrilled that someone had come up with this innovation, that civilization had advanced to the point where children at good restaurants were now immediately placated with children’s food, so we adults could plunge worry-free into our adult business of drinking alcohol and eating things with tentacles. For restaurateurs there are advantages, too. Marc Murphy, the chef and an owner of Landmarc in TriBeCa (and its new sister operation in the Time Warner Center), says doing a children’s menu has helped the bottom line at his bistro, which is known for its neighborhood clientele and value-priced wines. “It totally drives that early seating for us,” he said. “The kids eat what they eat, and with our wine program, the parents can have fun.” Landmarc serves up the requisite greatest hits — the fingers, the burger, the grilled cheese — and throws in some curveballs, like “green eggs and ham,” flavored and colored with pesto sauce. As for me, my outlook on children’s menus started to change at some point — probably around the 102nd or 103rd time my children ordered chicken fingers with French fries. Even if the chicken fingers were good ones, made from real breast meat rather than pulverized and remolded chik-a-bits, I was disturbed by their ubiquity and their hold on my kids, who are 11 and 8 years old. I noticed that accommodationist chefs were making chicken fingers available in Italian, Chinese and Japanese restaurants, where chicken fingers aren’t even culinarily justifiable. I perceived that my children’s chicken-finger meals outside the home were informing their eating habits inside the home, where they were getting more finicky. I heard from other parents that they were experiencing the same thing. In short, I came to the realization that America is in the grips of a nefarious chicken-finger pandemic, in which a blandly tasty foodstuff has somehow become the de facto official nibble of our young. For all the fretfulness I’m obligated to express over the health implications of this pandemic — chicken fingers are often fried, and are often accompanied by fries — I’m much more rankled by its palate-deadening potential. Far from being an advance, I’ve concluded, the standard children’s menu is regressive, encouraging children (and their misguided parents) to believe that there is a rigidly delineated “kids’ cuisine” that exists entirely apart from grown-up cuisine. I grew up eating what my parents ate, at home and at restaurants. Sometimes, the experience could be revelatory, as when I tried fish chowder for the first time on a trip to Boston, or when my mother attempted ’s Soupe au Pistou. Other times, dinner was merely dinner, not transcendent but comfortingly routine. And then there were those bummer meals that I just didn’t care for, like stuffed cabbage, but that I endured because my parents offered no other choice. It was all experiential grist for the mill, and it made me — like millions of other Americans of my generation who were raised the same way — a fairly adventurous eater with a built-in sense of dietary balance. It pains me that many children now grow up eating little besides golden-brown logs of kid food, especially in a time when the quality, variety and availability of good ingredients is better than ever.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/dining/reviews/30wine.html New York City Restaurant Reviews WINES OF THE TIMES Summer Breezes in, Sipping Barbera that noise? Sort of like a whoosh, a collective exhale, a sigh of relaxation? Is it a signal that summer may finally be upon us? of The Times: Barbera d'Asti and d'Alba Pairings: An Earthy Mushroom Pasta Sauce With Piquant Cheese for an Earthy, Truffly Wine Regardless of the calendar, here in the Northeast Memorial Day is the figurative beginning of summer. Sure, school has a few more lumbering weeks to go, and the water isn’t yet warm enough to shed the wet suit. But outdoor cooking has begun, and that, my friends, means it’s time to open up that top button, loosen up those shoulders and allow that pent-up anxiety to ease itself away. Which brings us to barbera. Now, don’t tighten up! Class most definitely is not in session. This will be fun. Why? Because barbera is exactly what you want for those burgers sizzling on the grill. We could talk about a lot of different red wines for summer, when you tire of whites and rosés. Zinfandel might be a nice choice, if you could find one with an alcohol level below 15 percent. So might a Côtes-du-Rhône. But a good barbera is the epitome of an elemental, honest red wine. It offers you fruit — lots of spicy cherry and raspberry flavors — and it doesn’t hurl them at you in some formless mass. Barbera is shaped by a bracing acidity. It’s got a bite, a burr, that makes the fruit incisive and refreshing. Though barbera is a red wine, it behaves like a white. Unlike most reds it has few tannins. Structure comes from the acidity, as with most whites, and while you wouldn’t want to serve it icy cold, it does take to a light chilling. Come to think of it, barbera has a lot in common with Beaujolais, too, another red with good acidity and low tannins. Both are joyous wines, and both are somewhat out of favor, undeservedly so. The truth is, barbera and Beaujolais share an esteem problem. Barbera, like dolcetto, has long been one of the everyday reds of the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy. Today’s wine culture, which overvalues the great at the expense of the good, pays far more attention to the powerful, profound Barolos and Barbarescos, and less to daily dinner table wines like barbera. As a result, some barbera producers determined that they would try to make more serious barberas. They planted the grapes in better sites, gave them more attention and limited the yields. They aged the wine in new oak barrels as if it were a top Bordeaux. Every once in a while, these wines have hit the mark, as in the brilliant but hard-to-find barberas of Braida, which integrate the fruit of the barbera and the tannins of the oak into a seamless whole. More often they come across not as profound but as pretentious, because the essence of barbera, that cherry fruit with its refreshing rasp, is buried under velvety soft flavors of vanilla and chocolate flavors derived from oak. Nonetheless, this experimentation underlined the fact that barbera deserves to be taken seriously, though without ostentation. And in fact, plenty of fine barbera is produced, as the wine panel confirmed in a tasting of 25 bottles from the Alba and Asti sections of the Piedmont. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Piero Trotta, wine director at San Domenico, and Marco Albanese, wine director at Lupa. Good barbera today resides somewhere between the simple wines of old, which could be thin and acidic, and the oaky aspiration bottles, tasting purely of ambition. The best barberas seem suspended on a teetering balance, pulled by the bright fruit on the one side and the acidity on the other. That tension gives the wine its characteristic energy. The last bottle on our Top 10 list is a perfect example. It’s the 2004 Le Orme from Michele Chiarlo, a big producer in Asti who also makes some more ambitious bottles. This one is pure and simple barbera, with sparkling acidity and glistening cherry fruit unimpeded by oak flavors. It’s a good introduction to barbera, and yet the wines can be much more than this, as with our No. 1 wine, the 2004 from Bartolo Mascarello, a wine of great intensity, full of rich, earthy fruit flavors and yet deliciously refreshing. It does the balancing act with barely a shiver. your wedding a day to remember In the Weddings Directory: View All Paid Announcements Search Vendors & Services Post Your Paid Announcement

It’s filtered before it reaches the table, but it’s from the public water system, just the same. “Serving our local water in reusable carafes makes more sense for the environment than manufacturing thousands of single-use glass bottles for someone to use once and throw away,” Incanto explains at its Web site. These two Bay Area restaurants were pretty much alone in kicking the bottle habit until Alice Waters, the godmother of things organic, sustainable and local, banned bottled still water at Chez Panisse in Berkeley last year and started serving only house-made sparkling water this year. Then the press took notice. Now other California restaurants, like Nopa in San Francisco, are following suit. Even an ice cream shop — Ici, in Berkeley — has jumped on the non-bottled-water wagon. And now, with a little push from Ms. Waters, an important New York City restaurant is coming on board. It’s a big move in the restaurant industry, which, if you extrapolate from the amount of water it buys, takes in at least $200 million to $350 million from bottled water a year, according to the restaurant consultant Clark Wolf. The “eat local” movement first became popular in California, so it makes sense that “drink local” is catching on there as a way to reduce the environmental costs of manufacturing and transporting bottles of water, as well as the mountains of plastic that end up in landfills. But soon the owners of Del Posto in New York, the most elegant and expensive of the restaurants in the empire of Joseph Bastianich and Mario Batali, will be joining the nascent movement — once they decide on the proper containers for their filtered still and carbonated tap water. Etched on the glass will be an explanation of why bottled water is no longer available. “Filling cargo ships with water and sending it hundreds and thousands of miles to get it around the world seems ridiculous,” Mr. Bastianich said. “With all the other things we do for sustainability, it makes sense.” He added that of all their restaurants, Del Posto was best able to afford the change. When Maury Rubin opened the first Birdbath Neighborhood Green Bakery in the East Village in 2005 and the second in Greenwich Village last month, banning bottled water was a no-brainer. “It was actually an easy decision,” Mr. Rubin said. “Bottled water is not great for the environment.” Other restaurants, including the Farmers Diner in Quechee, Vt., have made the switch, but they have not made waves. Tod Murphy, who owns the diner and has gained a certain celebrity in the food world for serving local products, stopped ordering bottled water in February. “It makes no sense, because we have great well water,” he said, “but I had no idea I was on the cutting edge.” For almost everyone else the idea is still in the talking stage, in part because there’s a big profit in bottled water, even though some of it comes out of a tap before it goes into the bottle. Restaurants buy it for $1 or $2 and sell it for as much as $8, or even more, giving it the highest markup of any item on the menu. Most restaurants making their own sparkling water are not charging for it. Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef and an owner of Country in Manhattan, described the ban as “a worthy thing to do.” But he added, “You have to make a profit.” “Alice is very commendable and extraordinary, and we look to her,” Mr. Zakarian said, “but I think she gets carried away sometimes.” He wondered where he would make up the lost revenue if he eliminated bottled water. “Serving tap water is a great idea that we’d all love to be able to do, but it’s not going to happen all at once.” Tom Colicchio, the chef and an owner of Craft restaurant and several spinoffs, was incredulous that restaurants would contemplate such a change. “This is the first I’ve heard of it,” he said. “Why would you do that — not from a money standpoint, but from a service and hospitality standpoint? Fifty to 60 percent prefer bottled water, especially sparkling.” home & garden professionals in your area today In Home & Garden: View all Post Your Ad Now!

Sort of like a whoosh, a collective exhale, a sigh of relaxation? Is it a signal that summer may finally be upon us? of The Times: Barbera d'Asti and d'Alba Pairings: An Earthy Mushroom Pasta Sauce With Piquant Cheese for an Earthy, Truffly Wine Regardless of the calendar, here in the Northeast Memorial Day is the figurative beginning of summer. Sure, school has a few more lumbering weeks to go, and the water isn’t yet warm enough to shed the wet suit. But outdoor cooking has begun, and that, my friends, means it’s time to open up that top button, loosen up those shoulders and allow that pent-up anxiety to ease itself away. Which brings us to barbera. Now, don’t tighten up! Class most definitely is not in session. This will be fun. Why? Because barbera is exactly what you want for those burgers sizzling on the grill. We could talk about a lot of different red wines for summer, when you tire of whites and rosés. Zinfandel might be a nice choice, if you could find one with an alcohol level below 15 percent. So might a Côtes-du-Rhône. But a good barbera is the epitome of an elemental, honest red wine. It offers you fruit — lots of spicy cherry and raspberry flavors — and it doesn’t hurl them at you in some formless mass. Barbera is shaped by a bracing acidity. It’s got a bite, a burr, that makes the fruit incisive and refreshing. Though barbera is a red wine, it behaves like a white. Unlike most reds it has few tannins. Structure comes from the acidity, as with most whites, and while you wouldn’t want to serve it icy cold, it does take to a light chilling. Come to think of it, barbera has a lot in common with Beaujolais, too, another red with good acidity and low tannins. Both are joyous wines, and both are somewhat out of favor, undeservedly so. The truth is, barbera and Beaujolais share an esteem problem. Barbera, like dolcetto, has long been one of the everyday reds of the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy. Today’s wine culture, which overvalues the great at the expense of the good, pays far more attention to the powerful, profound Barolos and Barbarescos, and less to daily dinner table wines like barbera. As a result, some barbera producers determined that they would try to make more serious barberas. They planted the grapes in better sites, gave them more attention and limited the yields. They aged the wine in new oak barrels as if it were a top Bordeaux. Every once in a while, these wines have hit the mark, as in the brilliant but hard-to-find barberas of Braida, which integrate the fruit of the barbera and the tannins of the oak into a seamless whole. More often they come across not as profound but as pretentious, because the essence of barbera, that cherry fruit with its refreshing rasp, is buried under velvety soft flavors of vanilla and chocolate flavors derived from oak. Nonetheless, this experimentation underlined the fact that barbera deserves to be taken seriously, though without ostentation. And in fact, plenty of fine barbera is produced, as the wine panel confirmed in a tasting of 25 bottles from the Alba and Asti sections of the Piedmont. For the tasting, Florence Fabricant and I were joined by Piero Trotta, wine director at San Domenico, and Marco Albanese, wine director at Lupa. Good barbera today resides somewhere between the simple wines of old, which could be thin and acidic, and the oaky aspiration bottles, tasting purely of ambition. The best barberas seem suspended on a teetering balance, pulled by the bright fruit on the one side and the acidity on the other. That tension gives the wine its characteristic energy. The last bottle on our Top 10 list is a perfect example. It’s the 2004 Le Orme from Michele Chiarlo, a big producer in Asti who also makes some more ambitious bottles. This one is pure and simple barbera, with sparkling acidity and glistening cherry fruit unimpeded by oak flavors. It’s a good introduction to barbera, and yet the wines can be much more than this, as with our No. 1 wine, the 2004 from Bartolo Mascarello, a wine of great intensity, full of rich, earthy fruit flavors and yet deliciously refreshing. It does the balancing act with barely a shiver.

June is also the month to celebrate papayas, iced tea, frozen yogurt, candy, soul food, steakhouses and applesauce cake. And whether you eat turkeys or simply admire them, prepare to party. June is Turkey Lovers’ Month, too. by Seymour Chwast At least 175 days a year are set aside in recognition of some form of food or drink. This puts a lot of pressure on the average eater. The week of July 15 alone starts with Tapioca Day, moves into Fresh Spinach Day, National Caviar Day and National Daiquiri Day, and ends with National Junk Food Day. Most food holidays didn’t spring from a spontaneous national outpouring of passion for, say, lunchmeat (Bologna Day is Oct. 24, by the way). Unlike Mother’s Day, which sprung from early anti-war efforts, National Crown Roast of Pork Day (March 7) has no political underpinnings. National Frozen Food Month (also in March) does not have the religious or cultural framework of Valentine’s Day. Although most elected officials will happily declare a food holiday when a trade association or commodity group asks, the proclamations don’t really mean much. Schools and banks do not close for National Vinegar Day (June 16). No, most food holidays are invented by people who want to sell more food. Bake for Family Fun Month, bless its heart, appears dedicated to preserving a meaningful ritual of the kitchen during February. That may well happen, but the holiday also benefits its sponsor, an association of companies that sell flour, butter and home baking equipment. So many food holidays can be hard to keep track of. There are almost two dozen dessert days, a number that begs for comparisons. Is National Sacher Torte Day bigger than Spongecake Day? Or are both kicked to the curb by National Butterscotch Pudding Day? (Sept. 19, if you’re planning ahead.) Food holidays can highlight gross injustice. Consider the sandwich category. Egg salad gets a week in April, but the peanut butter and jelly — clearly the more enduring American sandwich — has only a day (April 2). Nowhere are the holidays more unevenly distributed than among the fruits. Is it fair, for example, that raisins and figs get only a week each, but peaches have an entire month (July)? And peaches have nothing on apples, which get three months (September through November), with special break-out days for specific varieties. (Eat a Red Apple Day comes, inexplicably, on Dec. 1.) Blame seniority. Apple Week is one of the earliest food holidays. It began in 1904. By the 1970s, the week became a month, and by the 1990s the apple celebration had grown to three months, said Kay Rentzel, director of the U.S. Apple Association’s national apple month program. Apple sales jump by as much as 25 percent during the promotion, Ms. Rentzel said. Last year 5,550 retailers received certificates from Ms. Rentzel’s office for participating. “They may have special apple events that go on or they may have special signage in their store,” she said. “Some stores will do a baking contest. It’s a pretty exciting time.” Often, a commodity group looking to popularize a food holiday will wrangle a government official to help. Three years ago, the California Wine Institute convinced Gov. to declare September California Wine Month. It’s not the only food holiday he likes. Mr. Schwarzenegger declared July California Wild King Salmon Month and January California Dried Plum Digestive Health Month. But prunes and cabernet don’t need the governor’s blessing. In the loosely organized world of food holidays, nothing is really required for legitimacy. One could simply decide that Sept. 12 is Ropa Vieja Day and hope that a blogger somewhere picks it up and gives it some traction. For serious students of the genre, there is something of an authority: Chase’s Calendar of Events, 750 pages of notable birthdays, community happenings and holidays. If someone develops an idea for, say, Bread Pudding Recipe Exchange Week (May 1-7) and submits a form found in the back of the book, it will be considered for inclusion. Chase’s has standards, and not every proposal makes the cut. An organization has to agree to sponsor the holiday, or there has to be some sort of ongoing promotion or tangible enthusiasm for it, said Holly McGuire, who edits the book in Chicago.
