http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6570171.stm a 'dead' language 25 April 2007, 09:07 GMT 10:07 a 'dead' language Lorna encourages the children to express themselves in Latin The children are writing postcards about their favourite things - holidays, sport, food. But however many times they jot down "wish you were here", their intended recipients never will be. They have been dead for about 2,000 years. It sounds macabre, but a primary school in Hackney, east London, is actually trying to keep something alive. Latin, the ancient language which has long been in decline in state schools, is being taught in the area for the first time that anyone can remember. The postcards are written as if they are for children living in ancient Rome. Class organiser Lorna Robinson has even devised special words - such as "pedifolle" for football and "campus lusorius" for playground - for nine and 10-year-olds at Benthal Primary School to use. The aim is to introduce the ethnically mixed pupils, who speak up to 30 different languages at home, to Latin, which underpins much English vocabulary. Lorna, who started the classes last September, said: "We want to see if the Latin improves their literacy results. It's a very specific aim. "We also want to promote interest and opportunities to learn Latin in state schools. "It will help the children think about language and how it is constructed at an early age. They all ask questions and are making good progress. "Often, because they are so young, they are able to remember more words than I can." Some of the children have a lot of behaviour problems. It's challenging but interesting as well The children have taken part in activities as modern as bingo and making up road signs. Judging by the rapid raising of hands every time Lorna asks a question, they enjoy the lessons. Johanna, nine, said: "I think it's really interesting. We've done a lot of fun stuff and it helps me with some words when we're doing literacy. "My mum is Brazilian and the Latin helps me with my Portuguese." Humayra, 10, added: "I find it fun and it's different from anything else I've done. I can speak Bengali but it's not very similar to Latin, so it's hard to learn. "I think Latin helps me most with writing in literacy lessons." Lorna, who has a PhD from Oxford University, in which she compared the works of Roman poet Ovid with the Latin American magical realist movement, has made it her mission to promote the classics in state schools. Last year she left a teaching job at Wellington College, a public school in Berkshire which charges fees of up to £24,000 a year. The change of scene is striking. Lorna, who is being funded by Cambridge University, said: "Some of the children have a lot of behaviour problems. It's challenging but interesting as well. Modern dramas are reviving interest in Latin and ancient Roman history "Overall, the children here are really engaged and work very hard. "Sometimes people have a defeatist attitude to schools in inner-city areas and they criticise new initiatives, but this has been eye-opening. "It's been working well but it's not sustainable unless the government steps in and expands the plans." Lorna added: "I've tried to make the Latin lessons very activity-based. "It's sort of like being a detective. We start off using words on cards and get them to work out the links with English words. "Then we do things like play bingo to teach them numbers. Recently we taught the kids imperatives in Latin by designing road signs. "One of the good things about Latin not being a spoken language is it's more theoretical, meaning kids can look at words and work out what they mean." The pupils have recently taken part in a drama workshop in Latin, in which former Royal Shakespeare Company actors re-enacted historical stories and myths. Five primary schools in Hackney will be offering Latin from September, while Lorna is already teaching in Kilburn, in north-west London. Boris Johnson, the shadow higher education minister who has presented television programmes on the ancient world, is an enthusiastic supporter of the project. Performances in English tests over the next few years will show whether the project is having a concrete effect, but Benthal's young head teacher Tim Hunter-Whitehouse is already full of praise for the effect Latin has had. He said: "It's given the children something new and interesting. It gives them a historical basis of language. "It could be seen as a slightly dead subject but it has many uses, especially using terms in subjects like maths and science. "It's a taster for the children. The curriculum is busy but you have got to be as creative as you can and create as broad a range of experiences as possible." Dr Robinson is also editing a Latin and Greek magazine called Iris, which is being distributed free to state schools by Cambridge University. Latin certainly needs a boost. GCSE entries fell from 16,000 in 1988 to 9,900 in 2004. Asked whether any of Benthal Primary School's pupils will one day follow her and study classics at university, Lorna replied: "That's not the aim of the course. But it would be nice." This summer, though, could present her sternest challenge. Lorna has agreed to go to the US to teach Latin in five schools in the Bronx, one of the toughest areas of New York. She said: "I'm very excited about it but also apprehensive. I've never been to America before, so I'm walking into the unknown. But I suppose it's not the first time." is responsible for 'wasting millions' on drugs?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6700361.stm plan for Cornwall 29 May 2007, 11:10 GMT 12:10 plan for Cornwall There are proposals for "next generation" academies A new type of "all in one" academy is proposed for Cornwall, which would combine a school, further education college and a university. The project, to be submitted to the Department for Education and Skills, could provide integrated centres for students from 11 to 21 years old. There are proposals for two such academies - aimed at raising skills and qualification levels in Cornwall. The sites under consideration are Newquay and Camborne, Pool and Redruth. The aim of the project - described as "next-generation" academies - is to provide a more effective way of keeping young people in education and to reduce the drop-out levels between different stages. It is aimed at deprived parts of Cornwall, where too many young people have left education without adequate qualifications. In the Camborne area, a former mining area that has undergone a long period of industrial decline, more than a third of the working-age population is without any qualifications. By creating a "seamless" provision - where children are part of an institution that stretches from the beginning of secondary school to university - the intention is to encourage more youngsters to stay in education. The proposal, still at a feasibility stage, involves Cornwall County Council, Plymouth University and Cornwall College. There have already been a number of proposals for "all-through" academies, which would take pupils from infants through to the end of secondary. The intention of these academies for five to 18 year olds would be to avoid the disruption in the transfer between primary and secondary - and to maintain a culture of learning fostered from the first years in school. Academies are the government's flagship scheme to raise educational standards in deprived areas - with a target of 400 to be opened. They are non-selective and non-fee paying, but operate outside the control of the local authority and require £2m from sponsors. Teachers' unions have criticised the high cost of these new schools and the involvement of private-sector sponsors. Although closely-identified with the outgoing prime minister, Tony Blair, both his successor Gordon Brown, and the Conservatives' education spokesman, David Willetts, have committed themselves to supporting the academy programme. to sponsor two academies 24 pledges academy support 15 camp over planned academy 12 Apr
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6564933.stm education, education' 14 May 2007, 15:37 GMT 16:37 News education reporter "Education, education, education" was how Tony Blair set out his priorities for office - as Labour campaigned to put classrooms at the top of the political agenda. So how much has his 10 years in office achieved for schools, colleges and universities in England? Devolution is another part of the legacy, so this has been about England rather than the rest of the UK. How much has the reality matched the rhetoric of radical change? There is no doubt that there has been a major financial investment. Whether the money has been wisely spent is another question - but the cash has certainly been made available, with the government now spending almost £1.2bn on education every week. So where has the money gone? What were the highs and lows? Between 1997 and the current academic year, the core "per pupil" funding has risen by 48% in real terms - or £1,450 more per year per child. By the end of next year, it will be a 55% increase. There are now about 35,000 more teachers than in 1997 - reducing pupil-teacher ratios and class sizes in primary and secondary. Teachers' pay has risen by 18% in real terms, and heads have had a pay hike of 27%. Another quiet revolution has been the huge increase in support workers, such as teaching assistants - up by 172,000. To put it into context, that's like recruiting an additional workforce that is bigger than the army, navy and air force put together. This means that there are now almost three quarters of a million people working in schools - and that in secondary schools there is one adult for every 11 pupils. EDUCATION SINCE 1997, ENGLAND per pupil funding up 48% (55% by 2008) 172,000 more teaching assistants 18% rise in teachers' pay 1,106 new schools; others refurbished five good GCSEs with English and maths up from 36% to 45% truancy unchanged despite fines and prison for parents a quarter of 16 to 18-year-olds still not in education or training employees receiving job-related training unchanged on 15% university tuition fees introduced then raised to £3,000 p.a. first-time higher education students up 44,000 to 283,000 Anyone who has walked into a school, particularly in the last couple of years, will have seen school buildings renovated or replaced and the upgrades in information technology. Capital investment has increased eightfold since 1997. But while it might sound as though the cash is being bulldozed into education, seen from an international perspective the spending suddenly seems more modest. By the end of the decade, education will be receiving 5.6% of GDP - which compares to the 5.5% that is the current average for education in industrialised countries. It means a huge amount of cash has been spent to push us all the way up to average. But have standards improved? Has the investment brought the promised advances? When Labour entered office, another mantra was that it was about "standards not structures". Rather than get dragged into arguments over the few remaining grammar schools or tussling over school choice, the emphasis was on a drive to push up standards in all schools - such as introducing a compulsory literacy and numeracy hour in primary schools. Has it worked? Educational achievement is a slow supertanker to turn around, with initiatives taking many years to work through the system. The first wave of pupils to have received the literacy hour throughout their primary school years still have not taken their GCSEs. But have test and exam results shown improvements? In primary school tests in 1997, taken in the weeks before the general election, 63% of 11-year-olds reached the expected levels in English, 62% in maths and 69% in science. Nine years later, the test results were all up - 79% in English, 76% in maths and 87% in science in 2006. Is it enough? Looked at another way, that means that more than one in five children have spent six or seven years in primary school without learning to read and write properly. Healthy school dinners appeared on the political menu And teachers complain about the creativity of the primary years being lost to an obsession with testing and league tables. Last summer's GCSE results were published with a new emphasis on the basics - measured in terms of how many pupils achieved the equivalent of five good GCSEs including English and maths. This showed that only 45.1% of pupils were ending compulsory education with these qualifications - up from 35.6% in 1997, although part of the change is that a much wider range of qualifications is now included among the "good GCSEs". Throughout the Blair years, there has been a constant debate over whether exam and test results are really an objective indication of higher standards. Can A-level results really improve year after year? As the Blair years progressed, the structures of education - how schools were organised and managed - became an increasingly important target, particularly as attention shifted from primary to secondary schools. Even though secondary school standards were broadly rising, there was still a stark gap between the achievement of pupils in affluent and deprived communities. There are parts of the country where a large majority of children can comfortably expect to go to university and others where it is more likely that youngsters will leave school at 16 without much in the way of qualifications. Tony Blair turned his attention to secondary schools And in a very Blairite blend, the cause of social justice and breaking the cycle of underachievement was coupled with controversial plans to shake up the public sector. Private companies took over failing local authorities, struggling schools were relaunched under Fresh Start and city academies were created, setting up high-cost, autonomous state schools with private sector involvement. The "education action zones" gave way to Excellence in Cities, focusing money and attention on inner-city underachievement. And now trusts are to create a new type of organisation, which could involve schools, colleges and universities outside of local authority control. Another phrase from the Blair era was the demise of the "bog standard comprehensive". And one of the huge, almost unacknowledged changes has been the disappearance of comprehensives from the English education system. A large majority - 85% - of state secondary schools are now specialist schools and there are plans for 400 city academies. The role of schools has also broadened in a way that would make many inner-city schools unrecognisable from a generation ago - providing social care as well as education. Extended schools with breakfast and after-school clubs have begun to blur the boundaries between education, childcare and social services. Secondary schools have parallel staffs of mentors and behaviour advisers. Local education authorities are now children's services. There has also been a push for early intervention - with free part-time nursery places for four and then three-year-olds and the Sure Start project, aimed at improving health, education and welfare for the youngest children. The government faced a major rebellion over tuition fees Higher education has been a consistently thorny area for the Blair governments. From the first announcement that tuition fees would be imposed for students, made back in 1997, it has been a tough pitch for education ministers. The biggest backbench rebellion faced by his government was over variable tuition fees - but now that the principle has been established, they seem set to become permanent fixture of university life. But despite the campaigns to widen access, there has only been slow progress in getting more youngsters from poorer homes into higher education. And the target of getting 50% of youngsters into university by the end of the decade now looks unlikely to achieved. This was a government that liked to set targets and has always showed strong controlling instincts, firing off guidelines and regulations with a rapidity that stretched the patience of many heads and teachers. It was accused of trying to run the country's schools from a photocopier in Westminster - and there are still frequent complaints of "initiative fatigue" and an overload of paperwork for head teachers. But there were other failures which showed how difficult it can be for governments to get people to change their behaviour. Truancy and behaviour problems have remained unresolved Truancy was going to be cut by a third, promised the social exclusion unit. In fact, despite threats of jailing parents and numerous ways of counting absences, the problem has refused to go away. Bad behaviour and aggression in the classroom also show no sign of significant change - despite numerous initiatives, crackdowns and promises of "zero tolerance". And the question of vocational education - always described as vital (for other people's children) - has remained unresolved, despite the chorus of warnings about skills gaps. The latest proposals - the specialised Diplomas - have already wobbled on the runway before take-off. What will be the legacy for subsequent governments? How do you compare the long-term impact of giving infants free fruit against a headline-grabbing multi-million-pound technology investment? How do you measure a free nursery place against a pay rise for teachers? Education reform is always a work in progress, slowly percolating through a diverse system, and likely to frustrate ministers looking for instant responses. How will it be judged? A golden age? A blizzard of gimmicks? A new lease of life for public services? A door opened for privatisation? There will be at least three and probably four general elections before today's Sure Start babies leave school and reveal the answers.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6653239.stm education farewell tour 14 May 2007, 14:42 GMT 15:42 education farewell tour Mr Blair was a hit on his final stop at a further education college Prime Minister Tony Blair has been making a whirlwind tour of education establishments, as he prepares to leave office. The BBC's Andrew Bomford was travelling with him and sent back his impressions. 1440 SOUTH TRAFFORD COLLEGE, ALTRINCHAM, CHESHIRE By far the most enthusiastic welcome of the day as close to 2,000 excited youngsters crowd the corridors and hang out of windows to shout "Tony, Tony!" like he's a visiting pop star. He watched trainee beauticians giving massages and manicures. He declined the offer to have his nails done but did accept a bag of cosmetics from one student who said: "This is for your wife, if you want to get into her good books tonight." In the college kitchen he saw trainee chefs preparing beef and spinach, and had a go at caramelising a crème brûlée with a blowtorch. As far as the legacy goes, judging by the reaction so far on day one of his tour, in educational terms at least it is secure. 1335 KILTON CHILDREN'S CENTRE, WORKSOP, NOTTINGHAMSHIRE The children's centre brings together pre-school provision with healthcare, maternity and ante-natal care and is one of more than 1,000 so far created. By now Mr Blair is running about an hour late. He is whisked in to story time and hears all about the hunt for a missing seashell. The children have made him a card, and hand over a basket of flowers. He is starting to look a little like the Queen. Mr Blair meets parents and toddlers and talks to them about this one stop shop with most of the services they need. One mother quite genuinely says it's a great time to be a parent right now. TB is beaming. This is what he came here for. 1155 WINDSOR HIGH SCHOOL, HALESOWEN, WEST MIDLANDS A stop to look at how different educational establishments can work together. Windsor High is to be a trust school, one of 70 pathfinders. It has teamed up with a sixth form college and with Wolverhampton University to extend what it can offer the children. Mr Blair met sixth form students who attend the local college for subjects such as business studies and hairdressing. He talked to one girl who has just started learning Cantonese. He was impressed, but then she admitted that so far she had only learnt to count to 10. On the sports ground he watched a hockey lesson. Then when he spotted a tennis game in action hew couldn't resist the temptation to join in. He had a game with 13-year-old Charlie and did have some trouble returning the serve. Mr Blair blamed the artificial surface for the poor bounce, but afterwards Charlie said he thought the PM might have been making excuses. Tony Blair arrived by Royal Navy Merlin helicopter at one of the 26 new academy schools built so far. They are run as partnerships with private organisations, in this case the United Learning Trust. Teachers said more than £30m had been spent on the state-of-the art school which opened in January 2006. Here the PM saw local gymnasts honing their trampolining skills and was literally open-mouthed with amazement at their acrobatic skill. The instructor invited him to join in but he laughingly declined the opportunity. The gymnasts use school facilities for their training and are hoping to compete in the 2012 Olympics. They also help teach and inspire the schoolchildren. Mr Blair chatted to youngsters having a geography lesson. Seeing a wall poster about the European Parliament, Mr Blair asked the teacher if that was what they were studying. "No, we are actually doing natural disasters," she said. Mr Blair also wandered into a sixth form sociology class and immediately got into an impromptu discussion about relative and absolute poverty and what best improves people's prospects, benefits or education. The answer, left hanging, was obvious to everyone there - education. In a speech he referred to his own schooling at fee-paying Fettes College in Edinburgh, and said it had been his idea to create academies because he wanted others to get the same kind of opportunities. "I had a very privileged education," he said. "What that left with me all the time was the knowledge that, if I hadn't had that start in life, I wouldn't have been able to do what I was able to do. "This should be for all our children, all of them, to get the chance in life that they need." 0810 MILLENNIUM PRIMARY SCHOOL, GREENWICH Tony Blair and Education Secretary Alan Johnson arrive at the school in the shadow of that failed New Labour icon, the Millennium Dome. The school though is new. It was opened in 2001 and is very welcoming. It is one of 1,106 new schools opened during the Blair years. Mr Blair is met by head teacher Amanda Dennison and shown around by some of the schoolchildren including 11-year-old Christian. One of them is heard to ask: "So who is Gordon Brown anyway?" He sees the breakfast club, has a piece of toast with 10 children, and looks at the special needs provision for children with autism and cerebral palsy. After a tour of the adventure playground and football pitch he says what seems like a sad goodbye to the children - one of many goodbyes in the next few weeks. classroom: the verdict 10
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6665115.stm pushy parent confesses 17 May 2007, 10:57 GMT 11:57 pushy parent confesses Many children are coached for years The Conservatives are abandoning their support for the grammar school system in England, saying it mostly serves the middle-classes, who send their children to various activities to boost their chances of getting a place. In some parts of the country, it seems, parents are planning their grammar school place campaigns years ahead. One mother, who lives in Buckinghamshire, describes the lengths families go to and how she has reluctantly joined the scrum for a coveted place. Pushy parent? Who me? I don't think so. But I might occasionally test my daughter's knowledge of the times tables by asking random questions during longer car journeys. Or say, "Can you look at the clock and tell me what time it is - and what's that in digital?" And maybe I'll test the occasional spelling or three. All parents do that, don't they? But in recent months I've also started timing her on how many trees or pieces of furniture she can name in a minute. Does she know both meanings of words, like guard and lock? And what is the relationship between other words, like wax and wane, ebb and flow? Not to mention Saturday mornings spent slaving over test papers, Monday and Wednesday evening coaching sessions and finally, this week after a certain amount of soul-searching, I've signed her up for a week-long intensive summer school. To stand any chance of passing the 11-plus you have to pay Oh yes, I nearly forgot. I hear that extra-curricular music lessons are something else that pushy parents pay for. So, yes, she plays the oboe! But I'm not pushy, not by Buckinghamshire standards. I could repeat all sorts of anecdotes about the lengths people will go to round here - and why? Because we live in a county where any child capable of passing the 11-plus can attend a grammar school. Five years ago we moved out of London, partly drawn by the then distant prospect of grammar school education for our two daughters. Back then we still naively thought that grammar schools selected entrants purely on the basis of academic ability and that if our children did well in the state system they would naturally progress onto one of the local high schools. How wrong we were. Between us we earn two reasonable salaries, but certainly not enough to pay for private education and we saw the grammar school route as a chance of giving our daughters a great education at schools which regularly feature near the top of the league tables. So all they had to do was pass the 11-plus . We like to think our girls are reasonably intelligent and we class ourselves as the kind of supportive mum and dad who teachers welcome at parents' evenings with open arms. But that's not good enough round here to pass the 11-plus. No, to stand any chance of passing the 11-plus you have to pay. Summer schools now run for 11-plus entry All those who say grammar schools have been hijacked by the middle classes are absolutely right. The 11-plus is meant to be a test of a child's ability, rather like an IQ test, and you can't prepare for it. But that's where the argument falls down, because everybody who can afford it, pays for extra coaching. We opted for the drip-feed approach to coaching, regular sessions spread over about 20 months, others go for the more intensive, crammer courses. And then there are the week-long summer schools. One I spoke to "guarantees" to improve performance by 20% - well you can't afford not to, can you? So it all adds up. Talk to Class 5 parents in the playground and no-one wanted to get drawn down the coaching route. All we want is for our children "to achieve their potential" - that's the OK way of saying, we want them to have a chance of passing. You won't find verbal and non-verbal reasoning on any state school curriculum. The exam is all about patterns and sequences of numbers, words and shapes, testing how your mind works, not what it can remember about facts and figures. So you may not be able to revise in any conventional sense of the word, but you can certainly learn techniques and, when timing is such an important element of the exam, practice under an experienced guide is essential. When we signed our daughter up for primary school, we weren't looking at 11-plus results. We looked at artwork on classroom walls, we talked to happy pupils in the corridors, and welcoming staff who let us peer into their lessons. We didn't want pressured learning for our children. A lot of the local grammar school places will be taken up by children from private schools But only a handful of pupils from this year's Class 6 got through the exam and will go onto grammar school. A lot of the local grammar school places will be taken up by children from private schools. Children are regularly taken out of our small state primary, to get the benefit of two or three years private education with a view to passing the 11-plus and then moving back into the state sector. Of course, two or three years private primary education is a good deal cheaper than seven years of secondary schooling. Nice, if you can afford it. One of our daughter's best friends moved two years ago to a local private school. It wasn't a decision her parents took lightly. When they broke the news to us, they said they had to do the best they could for their child. What parent wouldn't? So their daughter now benefits from being taught in a class of 16 - having left an unruly class of 35. She has specialist teachers for different subjects - including weekly lessons in problem-solving aimed at preparing pupils for the 11-plus as well as the common entrance for independent schools. State schools are not allowed to coach children for the 11-plus. We've joined the middle classes who are paying to try to beat the system She'll also attend summer school, because all the other private school kids are doing the same. Of course, private education is still no guarantee of success, but the schools round here can soon tell you how many of their pupils got through the 11-plus and it's a very high percentage. For most of those state pupils who "fail" the 11-plus, the only option is the local comprehensive. Apparently our local comp is really coming up in the world, but not far enough to stop one of our neighbours, a head teacher, moving to ensure her daughter got into another school just a couple of miles away, over the county boundary in Hertfordshire. Yes, we're guilty as charged. We've joined the middle classes who are paying to try to beat the system. But have we paid enough? It's not how the grammar school system was meant to work and if we'd known five years ago, what we know now, would we have moved to Buckinghamshire? Probably not. and information to make a difference on school issues Q&A: What are grammar schools? 16 hits back over grammars 16 Children 'do better in grammars' 09 Apr 'help borderline pupils' 08 Sep 04 | Education Fewer poor pupils at grammars 31 Aug 04 | Education No more grammars, Tories pledge 09 Jan 06 | Education National Grammar Schools Association Campaign for State Education

It wants a minimum award of £3,000 and an end to the separate, performance-related upper pay scale. The NUT calls on the School Teachers' Review Body to ignore the government's 2% public sector pay rise target. The government has still not responded to the review body's request for a fresh remit to review this year's 2.5% rise, in light of higher inflation. Consumer price inflation (CPI) was 2.8% last month and the Retail Prices Index was 4.5%. The NUT's submission to the body says: "The government must renew its investment in teachers to secure the high quality education service that is its aim. For more than 30 years teaching has faced boom and bust ... it must stop NUT leader Steve Sinnott "This means pay levels for teachers that are competitive with comparable employment in both private and public sectors, along with matching opportunities for pay and career progression." It also rejects the government's insistence on the use of the CPI, which excludes housing costs, as the basis for pay settlements. The NUT said that, at current salary levels, young teachers were ruled out of the house buying market in more than three quarters of cities and towns throughout England and Wales. Average starting salaries among those joining major graduate employers were 14% (£2,785) higher than for graduate teachers - who also have to complete an extra year's training, the union said. After three years in the job that gap grew to £9,000, it said. General secretary Steve Sinnott said: "For more than 30 years teaching has faced boom and bust. "Each time salaries are brought more closely into line with that of comparable occupations, it is not very long till decline sets in yet again. "This is an illustration of the failure of successive governments to recognise the importance of the teaching profession to society. It must stop." Mr Sinnott said the suggested rise would encourage more graduates to choose teaching as a career. However, a group campaigning for lower taxes, maintained that getting rid of bureaucracy was the way to attract more people into the profession. Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, told the BBC: "I think teachers should be given a lot more scope and independence to teach as they want to teach. "And I think we get a better education system through that but also I think crucially we get a better motivated staff as well." pay award may be reviewed 20 Apr unions reject pay offer 23 teachers join pay protest 11 Apr inflation rate rises to 2.8% 20 Mar 07 | Business Teachers to get 2.5% pay increase 05 Dec 05 | Education Teachers back pay strike ballot 07 Apr for Education and Skills National Union of Teachers School Teachers Review Body

Regardless of your state of readiness there are certain things which can be done to improve your results. So read on. Swots too. And parents can play their part - by being seen and not heard. Tea, sympathy and understanding are the best they can offer. There is little else they can do and pointless turf wars may therefore be avoided. So read on if you are a student with exams to sit, as you are the one that can make a difference. But getting started is often the most difficult bit. Three hours in your bedroom - with good intentions - but playing with the cat, texting friends and looking out of the window instead, is pointless. Go for 10 minutes only but work in that time and do nothing else. That's all it takes to get started. The moment of truth looms for a million students Have a 10-minute break and start again, gradually building up to 20 or 40- minute periods, whilst keeping the breaks at 10 minutes. Try it and see. You may even work for longer periods without a break. Each of us is different and if it works for you, then do it. So that when you are working, you work, and when relaxing, you relax. The two don't mix. Grab extra quality study time during the day by getting up earlier or shortening your lunch break. Thirty minutes each school day would give an extra two-and-a-half hours a week, which may allow you to have a night off. Recreation should be built into your schedule. Make sure you get some but don't let it take over. Know when and where your exams are. Do past exam papers for practice. Ask your teachers if you are stuck. Work with a friend, if you really do work and it helps. Do two or three subjects in an evening, starting with the one you hate and finishing with the one you enjoy. You may even get to like the hated subject as you work on it and overcome those initial difficulties. THE BIG DAY DAWNS: FOCUS Exam rooms and dentists' chairs share certain memories, but the former need not be painful, if approached in the right way. A leisurely breakfast and a walk to school would be a good start. Don't rush and don't be late. Avoid friends, they can be off-putting and may confuse your thoughts. Mobile phones should be left at home. You could be disqualified if you have one with you. Have a glucose sweet to help the energy go to your brain. Take six deep breaths to relax and ignore those around you. It's your exam that concerns you, not theirs. IN THE EXAM HALL - TECHNIQUE COUNTS Read through the questions, jotting down formulae and points to remember on the question paper. Choose your questions, starting with the ones you can do to build confidence. Don't spend too long on any one question and try to do the number required. If you run out of time with only 10 minutes left for a 30-minute question, then do it in outline only - stating the main points and facts, if an essay - and by jotting down formulae and how you would use them to reach a solution, if science or maths. More marks can be gained this way with limited time available. Don't leave the exam room early and avoid friends discussing the paper afterwards. Nothing can be done to influence your marks on that paper now, but a lot can be done on the papers you have yet to sit. And that work should start straight away. Put your finished exam papers in a drawer and forget them, until your grandchildren ask to see them. They are of little value to you now, so don't waste that precious study time which you have available before the next exam, where you can make a difference. "Work", after all, comes after "success" - only in the dictionary. Remember that and do the best you can. I wish you well.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6700673.stm accused of exam drug use 29 May 2007, 11:54 GMT 12:54 accused of exam drug use Students are now in the exam revision season Parents are giving their children internet-bought "smart drugs" to boost their performance in the exam room, a psychologist has claimed. Anti-hyperactivity medicines like Ritalin are being used as a "study aid", says Leicester University's director of education Paul Cooper. The drug is given to hyperactive children to improve concentration. But Professor Cooper says taking it without medical supervision is unwise and can be dangerous. Nobody should be buying this kind of drug over the internet and they should not be taking it without medical supervision He said: "We are moving into a phase now where informed parents can by-pass the medical profession, go online and prescribe the drug themselves. "I have anecdotal evidence that a number of parents in this country have done this. I know of three parents who have done it in one state secondary school. "That's just one school and it is likely to be replicated on a massive scale," he added. Prof Cooper said the parents doing this probably thought their children had mild, but undiagnosed, ADHD and that drugs like Ritalin might buy them much needed extra time in the examination room. A child with the mildest form of the disorder was likely to find it difficult to concentrate for the length of time it took to write an essay in an exam setting, he said. People with the condition have a poor attention span and tend to be impulsive and restless, yet the underlying cause is still poorly understood. Drugs like Ritalin would help 80% of people regardless of whether they had the disorder or not, he said. But there were health risks to taking any drug in an unsupervised way. "My big concern is the regulatory aspect and the fact that nobody should be buying this kind of drug over the internet and they should not be taking it without medical supervision," Prof Cooper added. "Even though Ritalin is considered to be a relatively safe medication it still has to be prescribed properly. "It could improve performance, but people will respond differently. If a person has a history of seizures for example - they should not be prescribed this drug. "In our culture, educational attainment is valued so highly. People sell their houses to get near a school or lie about where they live to get a child into a school. "It's a distorted value in our culture. So anything a parent can do to get some kind of educational advantage - they will do it." Prof Cooper says he would like to see further research into the scale of the problem. accused of GCSE cheating 14 rise leads to ADHD probe 20 Dec 04 | Scotland Brain clues to attention disorder 21 Nov 03 | Health
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6705439.stm issues gay rights challenge 30 May 2007, 17:22 GMT 18:22 issues gay rights challenge The UCU says homosexuals should not be treated as inferior Schools should not be allowed to promote marriage over homosexual partnerships, academics have said. The University and College Union said any negative characterisations of homosexuality by teachers should be regarded as discrimination. The UCU said new regulations to outlaw discrimination against individuals on grounds of sexual orientation did not go far enough. The union said change would only come about as a result of education. Delegates at UCU's annual conference in Bournemouth unanimously backed the motion which said: "All negative characterisations by teachers of lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgender people, identity and lifestyle should be outlawed and classified as an act of discrimination and an incitement to hatred based on sexual orientation." Government guidance on new sexual orientation regulations says that faith schools will not be breaking the law if they continue to teach that homosexuality is a sin. The guidance states: "If a faith school (or indeed any school) teaches that the Christian and Muslim faiths decree that same-sex sexual activity is a sin, then the school will not be acting unlawfully. "Similarly, if a pupil asks a teacher his views on homosexuality and the teacher gives his view, then again, that teacher will not be acting unlawfully." Alan Whitaker, a lecturer from Oxford and Cherwell Valley College in Oxfordshire, who put forward the proposal, criticised the new regulations. He said the rules did nothing to stop "the negative characterisation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender lifestyles by teachers". "The regulations actually say that there is nothing to stop teachers proclaiming the superiority of heterosexual marriage. "The regulations say it's unlawful to characterise same-sex relationships as inferior. "But to my mind it's rather difficult to see how you can do the one without implying you are doing the other," Mr Whitaker said. "Legislation cannot do all the work. It may remove the injustice but it cannot change attitudes. "If attitudes are to change that will come about as a result of education. "And that makes it vitally important that teachers do not instil negative images of same-sex relationships and transgender people in those that they teach." Stephen Desmond, from Thames Valley University, told delegates: "We must never allow freedom of religion to be hijacked and used as a pretext to discriminate against gay and lesbian teenagers in schools." A spokesman for the Department for Education and Skills said: "These regulations ensure that everyone is treated fairly and with respect, no matter what their sexual orientation, religion or belief. "We trust teachers to use their professional judgement to decide which resources or publications can support teaching and learning in the classroom. "Existing guidance makes clear that teaching should meet the needs of all young people whatever their family circumstances or developing sexuality and that all topics related to sex and sexuality are taught in a way that is age-appropriate." and information to make a difference on school issues Young children 'learn homophobia' 14 Jun 06 | Education Schools 'failing young gay men' 16 May 06 | Education Schools tackle homophobic bullies 23 Nov 04 | Education Coming out at school 04 Jun 04 | Education BBC Schools: Bullying advice University and College Union
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6708181.stm 31 May 2007, 15:20 GMT 16:20 education includes courses and job training. Teenagers should not be "coerced" into staying on in education until the age of 18, a lecturers' union has said. The University and College Union (UCU) backed an emergency motion at its annual conference, opposing government plans to raise the school leaving age. The union said it was against "coercion and the threat of criminal/civil action to make students stay on in education". Ministers say proposed enforcement measures such as fixed penalty notices would only be used as a last resort. UCU joint general secretary Sally Hunt told delegates in Bournemouth: "We all know that school students should be encouraged to continue their education beyond the age of 16 but they should not be conscripted into staying on until 18. "Professional teachers know that compulsion is not the way to motivate young people. "The key is to examine the curriculum and student needs. Employers also have a responsibility to release young staff to study while being paid." The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) announced in January that by 2015 all young people would be required to stay in school, education or training until the age of 18. Education Secretary Alan Johnson said that enforcement action would only be taken in a minority of "hardcore" cases, where teenagers had refused help. A DfES spokesman said: "If a young person continues not to participate post-16 once barriers have been removed, support provided, and alternative learning options offered, local authorities will explain their duty and the consequence of not participating. "At this stage, it is proposed that they will be issued with an attendance order. We are consulting on this model of enforcement and appropriate penalty if it is breached." Both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats agree compulsion and threats is the wrong approach to increasing participation. Recent figures for England showed that 11% of 16 to 18-year-olds are still outside education, training or work. The UCU is calling for a range of measures aimed at encouraging teenagers to continue their studies after the age of 16. These include providing independent, impartial careers advice, paid time off for study and additional resources to "support continuing participation in learning." Many of these measures are contained in the government's proposals. drop-outs could be fined 22 Mar leaving age set to be 18 12 Jan skills are the new education 09 Dec 06 | Education More youths not in school or work 08 Jun 06 | Education University and College Union Department for Education and Skills

Dr Brian Lang told a conference in Edinburgh that funds for Scots universities are eclipsed by sums going to English and US institutions. Education Secretary Fiona Hyslop said she was currently looking at student finance. However, she said she had no plans for a graduate tax or a funding inquiry. While acknowledging that the issue of student finance was a contentious one, Dr Lang said the introduction of a graduation tax would be fairer for all students regardless of their economic background. He said: "For one thing the rate of tax levied can be in direct proportion to the financial benefit from enhanced earnings that the four or so years of university have brought to the graduate. "Graduate taxation might help to do away with the argument that fees are expected to be paid by impoverished undergraduates, because the tax payments would in reality be made by rather well-educated graduates, and even then only when they have found paid employment. "The notion of 'student debt' and its role in discouraging entry to higher education, would be substantially modified." The annual spend at Edinburgh University is £450m - half the level at Cambridge and far below the £3bn at Harvard. Dr Lang claimed that the discrepancy in funding was putting pressure on Scottish principals who are struggling to hang on to key staff who are offered better salaries and laboratories by rival universities around the world. The one-day conference, Higher Education and the Economy, aims to stimulate debate on the challenges faced by Scottish higher education. call for extra funds 26 Feb 07 | Scotland Campus appeal to first minister 09 Feb 07 | South of Scotland Universities create £77m alliance 01 Feb 07 | North East/N Isles Questions over university funding 06 Oct 06 | Scotland University of St Andrews EDINBURGH AND EAST STORIES Witness appeal after hit-and-run OAP billed for home's demolition Injured quad bike boy abandoned
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6705131.stm to consider Israeli boycott 30 May 2007, 18:54 GMT 19:54 to consider Israeli boycott BBC News education reporter Ms Hunt urged UCU members to reject the boycott motion Academics have backed calls for a wide-ranging debate on a boycott of Israeli academic institutions. The University and College Union (UCU) was urged, at its annual conference, to consider the "moral implications" of links with Israeli universities. The motion condemned Israel for its "denial of educational rights" to Palestinians, but opponents said a boycott would not advance their cause. Both the British and Israeli governments condemned the move. Universities are to Israel what the Springboks were to South Africa - a symbol of their national identity. Ahead of the debate UCU general secretary Sally Hunt urged delegates not to support the boycott call. Ms Hunt said she did not believe the majority of UCU members supported an academic boycott of Israel. But the motion, which argued that "passivity or neutrality was unacceptable" in the special circumstances of the Israeli occupation, will require union branches to consider a potential boycott. Philosophy lecturer at Brighton University Tom Hickey, who proposed the motion, described the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories as "barbaric". "What are we to do with this? Are we to look away? If we do we make ourselves complicit in it." He claimed that only a "handful of academics had separated themselves from collusion with the occupation", adding that justice must not be limited to home. But those opposing the motion argued that a boycott of Israeli academic institutions would do nothing to help the plight of the Palestinian people. Thames Valley University delegate Stephen Desmond said a blanket boycott of Israeli universities did nothing to move a two-state solution forward. "It does not move Palestinians to a place where Palestinians have a homeland to call their own." But London School of Economics delegate Mike Cushman said: "Universities are to Israel what the Springboks were to South Africa - a symbol of their national identity." University of East London delegate Philip Marfleet acknowledged the issue was a "highly charged" one and explained how he was a convert to the boycott campaign. He said he had visited universities in Israel and in the occupied territories, and that the difference between the two was striking. While the Israeli university was functioning well, the Palestinian university he saw had been closed for 51 consecutive weeks because of arrests and incursions by Israeli forces, he claimed. "Israeli academic freedom comes at the cost of the denial of the most basic of academic freedoms of Palestinian students," he added. Another delegate, Sue Blackwell from Birmingham University, described how during a visit to her campus, the mayor of the Palestinian town of Ramallah had said: "People are beginning to starve now. But for Israel it is business as usual." Journeys across the West Bank which had taken 20 minutes now took several hours because of all the army checkpoints, Ms Blackwell said. "It is only that change on the climate of opinion which will in the end, as it did in South Africa, create a lasting and just change in the Middle East." Delegates backed the motion in a card vote by 158 votes to 99, with 17 abstentions. A full debate on the issue is now expected within UCU branches throughout the country, with the hope that a vote on a formal boycott may be held at the union's conference next year. But the motion's proposer Mr Hickey said it would be up to the union's management to decide how this was put into action. If a boycott was to be agreed upon it might mean UCU members being urged not to attend conferences at Israeli universities or submit articles to their journals, he said. It would not mean Israeli academics could not come to UK campuses. Higher education minister Bill Rammell said he was "very disappointed" at the vote. "I profoundly believe this does nothing to promote the Middle East peace process. In fact the reverse." The vote has also horrified the Israeli government and Jewish groups in the UK. Israeli education minister Yuli Tamir claimed students at an Israeli college were being "bombarded by Palestinian Qassam rockets every day". Jeremy Newmark, chief executive of the umbrella group the Jewish Leadership Council, said he would be urging Ms Hunt to ensure any steps taking the union closer to a boycott would be put to a full ballot of UCU membership. He claimed a small group of "extreme hard-edged activists" had capitalised on a lack of leadership. overturn Israel boycott 26 May 05 | Education Academics back Israeli boycotts 22 Apr 05 | Education College unions reject pay offer 23 and College Union
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6703443.stm scorn government policy 30 May 2007, 14:07 GMT 15:07 scorn government policy Ms Hunt said the education system had been damaged A catalogue of "misaligned" government policies is damaging Britain's education system and its standing abroad, lecturers' leaders warn. Even when the policy was right, the end result was often wrong, University and College Union leader Sally Hunt told her union's annual conference. Ms Hunt said there had been "crazy" contradictions in policy. The Department for Education and Skills said no government had done more to engage young people in education. Ms Hunt was addressing the UCU's first conference, following a merger between Natfhe and the Association of University Teachers. Take science, where, despite warm words from ministers, we are still shutting labs almost as fast as they are building them in China She said: "Take English language classes for foreign speakers, the government champions social cohesion - but access to courses restricted. Crazy. "Take health, where community care is prioritised yet our members who train nurses are made redundant to fund NHS deficits. Shameful. "Take science, where, despite warm words from ministers, we are still shutting labs almost as fast as they are building them in China. Appalling. "And take lifelong learning, which ministers tell me is at the heart of the government's agenda, yet the results of cuts in funding led to a 17% reduction in adult learners last year." She added "This is not education policy. This is a catalogue of misaligned objectives each with unintended but entirely predictable consequences. "The reality of government policy for too many UCU members is job insecurity, increased casualisation and higher workloads." The government said Ms Hunt's claims were unfounded. Skills Minister Phil Hope said: "Our sweeping reforms to 14-19 education and further education mean results have never been higher and people are acquiring more relevant qualifications and skills. "We are seeing large increases in the numbers of applications from school leavers to study science and engineering subjects, with physics up 12%, chemistry 11% and maths up by 10%," he said. "Our huge investment in FE has seen funding increase by 48% in real terms between 1997 and 2005. Adult education funding will increase by 7% between 2005-06 and 2007-08. More adults are learning than ever before."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/uk_politics/6699211.stm | Tory reprimanded over grammars 29 May 2007, 07:54 GMT 08:54 reprimanded over grammars Mr Brady is a former grammar school pupil himself A frontbench Conservative MP has been "severely reprimanded" by the party's chief whip after suggesting selective schools can boost overall standards. Graham Brady was told to stick to his brief as Europe spokesman. The Altrincham and Sale West MP spoke out in defence of grammar schools in the row caused by the party's decision to turn against selection by ability. He released data to the Times, suggesting areas with selective schools got better exam results. Party leader David Cameron has promised more city academies - the privately sponsored state schools championed by Prime Minister Tony Blair - and more streaming and setting within existing schools. Graham would not have been doing his job if he had not stepped in and defended the grammar schools Q&A: What are grammars? But former grammar school pupil Mr Brady supplied data to the Times which indicated that in areas with no selective education fewer pupils get five or more GCSEs at grade A*-C including English and maths. "These facts appear to confirm my own experiences: that selection raises the standards for everyone in both grammar and high schools in selective areas," he told the paper. "It is vitally important that policy should be developed with a full understanding of all of these facts, which might lead to the introduction of selection in other ways." Fellow Conservative Nigel Evans, MP for Ribble Valley, said Mr Brady should "absolutely not" be censured for speaking out. He said the way that shadow education secretary David Willetts announced the policy "looked as if it was an attack on grammar schools". "Graham would not have been doing his job if he had not stepped in and defended the grammar schools," Mr Evans told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Mr Brady's crime was to re-open a debate which the Tory leader has declared to be over BBC political editor Nick Robinson Read Nick's thoughts in full "But at the same time Graham is 100% behind ensuring that the academies that David Willetts and David Cameron wish to see rolled around the country is going to become a reality so that youngsters of all abilities can get the education that they deserve." Mr Evans said he himself would continue to speak out about the grammar school he attended and the one in his constituency, but was also going to support the party's policy. "We are all getting behind the policy of ensuring that we're now going to concentrate and focus on those schools, those areas where youngsters are looking for a good education but at the moment it's not happening." A number of newspapers cite Conservative Party sources as suggesting Mr Brady may be axed from his role in a party reshuffle expected this summer.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6598943.stm combats campus culture shock 27 April 2007, 10:52 GMT 11:52 combats campus culture shock Freshers' week can be daunting for many students, Mr Maniar says A computer game has been devised to help overseas students deal with the culture shocks of university life in Britain, like seeing kissing in public. Players of C-Shock have to complete a series of tasks a foreign student might face on their first day at university. They include seeing people drinking alcohol and smoking, in a 3D recreation of the University of Portsmouth campus. One of its devisers, academic Nipan Maniar, said he hoped the game would help students know what to expect. We thought we could devise a game that they could play on their mobile phone on the way here so they would know what to expect The senior lecturer in the university's faculty of creative and cultural industries, who is Indian, said he experienced a "massive culture shock" himself when he came to Portsmouth in 2000 to do his MSc. "It was not just the environment I was in, but the teaching - the relationship with tutors was very informal." And many students from places like South Asia were often shocked to see women smoking, drinking and being friendly with the opposite sex, he said. This week, an Indian court issued an arrest warrant for Hollywood actor Richard Gere for kissing Bollywood star Shilpa Shetty in public. Mr Maniar went on: "I deal with many Indian students in my capacity as an international co-ordinator. "They often ask for a long list of all the things they should bring with them to Portsmouth. "Then when they arrive they become very worried and they don't know what to do - they can be really dependent. "So we thought we could devise a game that they could play on their mobile phones on the way here so they would know what to expect - so they don't get so much of a culture shock." Many overseas students are not used to seeing women drink It could be a kind of e-mother or mobile mother, Mr Maniar added. Fellow researcher Emily Bennett, who helped design the prototype of the game, says it has been well received by students. She said a version could also be designed that would be useful for British students too. "For the 18-year-old who is away from home for the first time, who is feeling disorientated and doesn't know where they are, it could help them as well." If they could not find a building they needed to go to, instead of getting out a brochure or a map they could refer to the game instead, she said. The game is the final stages of development but Mr Maniar is looking for a commercial sponsor to help produce it. He also believes gaming could have a much greater role in university learning. International students officer for the National Union of Students Issahaku Kotomah said: "International students can find it hard going, and some students do find elements of UK campus culture a bit of a shock. "It is, ultimately, very positive that the needs of overseas students are being taken into consideration." He said online games could be a powerful tool in helping international students acclimatise to life on a UK campus, as long as they are not solely about imposing a stereotype of campus life. faces Indian arrest warrant 27 Apr 07 | Entertainment Students sign mobile games deal 19 Apr 07 | Lancashire New students feel drink pressure 13 Oct 04 | Cambridgeshire Overseas students plans unveiled 18 Apr 06 | Education
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6704635.stm extremism request rejected 30 May 2007, 14:14 GMT 15:14 extremism request rejected BBC News education reporter in Bournemouth Lecturers say watching students would damage trust Lecturers have voted unanimously to oppose government plans urging them to fight against extremism on campuses. They had been asked to monitor and report suspicious behaviour amongst Muslim students. But at the University and Colleges Union annual conference in Bournemouth, delegates rejected the demands, saying they amounted to spying on students. UCU general secretary Sally Hunt said student trust would be undermined by fears of a "quasi-secret service". In November, the government warned of what it described as the serious threat posed by radical Muslims and issued guidance to colleges and universities calling on them to monitor student activity. But Ms Hunt said: "Lecturers have a pivotal role in building trust. These proposals, if implemented, would make that all but impossible. "Universities must remain safe spaces for lecturers and students to discuss and debate all sorts of ideas, including those that some people may consider challenging, offensive and even extreme. The strong message from this congress must be we will not spy on our Muslim or any other students UCU joint general secretary Paul Mackney "The last thing we need is people too frightened to discuss an issue because they fear some quasi-secret service will turn them in." The motion, from the union's transitional arrangements committee, expressed outrage at the "continuing escalation demonisation of Muslim and other minority communities", adding that this threatened to impinge on education. It opposed the ethnic profiling of students and staff, and pledged to challenge the "incursions of the security and immigration services to university and college campuses". The union would also defend the right of members to refuse to cooperate with attempts to "transform education into an extension of the security forces". A separate motion, put forward by university lecturers in London, argued increased surveillance of Muslims and other minority students amounted to a "witch-hunt". Presenting the motion, law lecturer at London Metropolitan University Mark Snaith said academics were there to inform students not inform on them. "I teach law, I do not impose or enforce law, especially not bad legislation," he added. Seconding the motion, lecturer Mark Campbell said: "Our universities are not hot beds of Islamic extremism that need to be cowed." That message needed to be challenged, he added He cited the case of a student from Swansea who was arrested and treated as a suspected terrorist after taking a picture of Tower Bridge. The reason for his arrest was because he possessed a book on Islamic Jihad against the West, Mr Campbell said. But this book was on the reading list for one of his university courses, he added. UCU joint general secretary Paul Mackney said staff had been asked to report if they heard them planning a bomb attack in the canteen. It was obvious staff would report the matter if they overheard such a thing, he said, but to their managers not to MI5 officers. The academics said that although they would report illegal activity, they would not act as detectives. "The strong message from this congress must be we will not spy on our Muslim or any other students," Mr Mackney added. But Professor Anthony Glees, who wrote a report in 2005 warning that extremists were operating on campuses, said the problem must not be ignored. "A significant number of people, either convicted of terrorist offences or who have admitted a guilt or who've been murdered or killed in the carrying out of their terrorist offences, have been students at British universities and colleges. "The evidence is overwhelming. The recent trial 30th of April this year - three of the people who got life sentences had been students at British universities and London Metropolitan University itself is frequently been cited as a place of Islamist extremism."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6700079.stm defended as 'very real' 29 May 2007, 11:39 GMT 12:39 defended as 'very real' The suggestion that dyslexia does not really exist has angered parents Dyslexia charities have rejected claims that the condition is a label used by middle-class parents who do not want their children seen as low achievers. The British Dyslexia Association and Dyslexia Action said people with dyslexia had a "very real" problem. They were responding to claims from Professor Joe Elliott, an educational psychologist at Durham University's School of Education. Professor Elliott said the term dyslexia was becoming meaningless. But the British Dyslexia Association and Dyslexia Action said that, to the six million people in the UK living with dyslexia, it was very real. "Dyslexia is a complex condition which affects each person differently and it is irrespective of intelligence, race or social background," the organisations said in a joint statement. "The severity and different difficulties any one dyslexic person may present can vary. It is for this reason that definitions of dyslexia are not always consistent. "Once again dyslexia seems to be making the headlines for all the wrong reasons. It is frustrating that the focus should be on whether dyslexia exists or not and claims that it does not is very upsetting to the one in 10 people that it effects. "The question should be what can be done to help people with dyslexia and those with literacy difficulties?" The charities said the effects of dyslexia could be minimised by targeted literacy intervention and technological support. They said the education system should look to identify and support all children at risk of reading failure. There have been previous claims that dyslexia was being too widely applied or was not an authentic learning problem. A television programme carrying such claims prompted Schools Minister Lord Adonis to defend the condition to the House of Lords. He told peers that dyslexia was a "complex neurological condition" and that people with it needed proper support.
