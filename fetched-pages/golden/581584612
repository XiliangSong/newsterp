http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/W/WA_SPAM_ARREST_WAOL-?SITE=OKPON&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT May 30, 8:54 PM EDT Feds in Seattle arrest man described as top spammer AP Legal Affairs Writer SEATTLE (AP) -- A 27-year-old man described as one of the world's top spammers was arrested Wednesday, a development that federal authorities said could lead to an immediate, perceptible decrease in the amount of junk e-mail winging its way across the Web. "He's one of the top 10 spammers in the world," said Tim Cranton, a Microsoft Corp. lawyer who is senior director of the company's Worldwide Internet Safety Programs. "He's a huge problem for our customers. This is a very good day." Robert Alan Soloway's arrest came a week after a federal grand jury returned a 35-count indictment charging him with mail fraud, wire fraud, e-mail fraud, aggravated identity theft and money laundering. He's accused of using networks of compromised computers to send out millions upon millions of junk e-mails since 2003. He continued his activities even after Microsoft won a $7 million civil judgment against him in 2005 and Robert Brauer, the operator of a small Internet service provider in western Oklahoma, won a $10 million judgment, prosecutors said. U.S. Attorney Jeff Sullivan said Wednesday the case is the first in the country in which federal prosecutors have used identity theft statutes to prosecute a spammer for taking over someone else's Internet domain name, and it would mean at least an extra two years on Soloway's sentence if he is convicted. He could face decades in prison, though prosecutors said they have not calculated what guideline sentencing range he might face. In court Wednesday afternoon, Soloway pleaded not guilty to all charges after a judge determined that - even with four bank accounts seized by the government - he was sufficiently well off to pay for his own lawyer. He has been living at the ritzy Harbor Steps apartments near Pike Place Market and drives an expensive Mercedes convertible, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Kathryn Warma. Prosecutors are seeking to have him forfeit $773,000 they say he made from his business, Newport Internet Marketing Corp. A public defender who represented him for Wednesday's hearing only declined to comment. The investigation began when the Federal Trade Commission, Better Business Bureau and Washington state attorney general's office began receiving hundreds of complaints about Soloway, who had been featured on a list of known spammers kept by The Spamhaus Project, an international anti-spam organization. The Santa Barbara County, Calif., Department of Social Services said it was spending $1,000 a week to fight the spam it was receiving, and other businesses and individuals complained of having their reputations damaged when it appeared spam was originating from their computers. "This is not just a nuisance. This is way beyond a nuisance," Warma said. Soloway used networks of compromised computers called "botnets" to send out unsolicited bulk e-mails urging people to use his Internet marketing company to advertise their products. People who clicked on a link in the e-mail were directed to his Web site, where he advertised two types of services. In one, he would agree to send out as many as 20 million e-mail advertisements over 15 days for $495, the indictment said. In another, he would offer to sell software that the buyer could use to "broadcast" e-mails to 80 million e-mail addresses. He falsely claimed the e-mail addresses were all legal, "opt-in" addresses of people who had chosen to receive the solicitations, and at any rate the software he sent typically didn't work, according to the indictment. The Spamhaus Project rejoiced at his arrest. "Soloway has been a long-term nuisance on the Internet - both in terms of the spam he sent, and the people he duped to use his spam service which has, in many cases, got them into trouble," organizers wrote on spamhaus.org. Soloway remained in federal detention pending a hearing Monday.

Spokeswoman Susan Gregg-Hanson says a sprinkler activated and put out the fire about 3:30 this morning on the fifth floor. She says the sprinkler caused water damage in eight patient rooms on the third and fourth floors. About 50 patients had to be moved to other parts of the hospital. No one was injured, and the hospital is still assessing the damage. Smoking is not allowed in the hospital. The hospital spokeswoman says she's sure the woman who started the fire feels bad. She will face no repercussions. Gregg-Hanson says, "She's here to get better."
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/J/JAPAN_BOEING_WAOL-?SITE=OKPON&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT May 31, 2:58 AM EDT Boeing Japan's new president vows to court government TOKYO (AP) -- Boeing Japan's new president said Thursday that building a strong relationship with the Japanese government was a priority for her job to maintain a key, half-century-long partnership for the U.S. aircraft maker. "We're very proud of this lasting relationship, and we value it very highly," Nicole Piasecki, president of Boeing Co.'s Japan unit since March, told reporters. "Japan is for Boeing the most important relationship we have outside of the United States." Japan has long been one of Chicago-based Boeing's most important customers. In the past decade, more than 80 percent of the airplanes ordered by Japanese customers, including Japan Airlines Corp. and All Nippon Airways Co., have been Boeing products. Piasecki said that partnership is strong, extending to working together in government defense projects, including fighters and missile defense as well as commercial aircraft. Boeing has been successful in Japan because of a deep understanding between the two countries developed over the years, she said. Helping cement the ties are dozens of Japanese companies that are longtime Boeing suppliers, including major machinery makers Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries. Their contribution in making the wing, fuselage and other plane parts has grown greater with Boeing's new 787 mid-sized aircraft, scheduled to enter commercial service next year. Boeing is using light, sturdy carbon-fiber composites to replace most of the aluminum on the 787 to make it more fuel-efficient at a time when soaring fuel costs are a critical problem at carriers. The 787 has attracted 584 orders so far, outpacing the rival offering from Airbus, which has about 260 orders for its A350. All Nippon Airways has ordered 50 787 jets, while JAL has ordered 30. But Boeing Senior Vice President Larry Dickenson said he would never take the Japan partnership for granted. "We've also worked very hard, as in any partnership, not to take the other partner for granted. We work every day to earn the right to have this partnership," he said.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/M/MT_ARLEE_SLAYING_WAOL-?SITE=OKPON&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT May 31, 9:32 AM EDT Spokane teenager found dead in Montana likely was strangled ARLEE, Mont. (AP) -- A young Spokane, Wash., woman whose body was found on a road southwest of town likely was strangled with a cord, rope or similar object, authorities said. After Tasheena Craft, 18, was found dead Tuesday, authorities said that she had been beaten in the head, but a forensic pathologist at the state crime lab told Lake County investigators Wednesday that she died of "homicidal violence" that included "probable ligature strangulation." Officers have arrested Kelly Birmingham, 19, also known as Kelly Stanfield. Besides murder, he faces an evidence tampering charge for allegedly moving Craft's body and felony escape for allegedly kicking out the window of a patrol vehicle and jumping out while he was being taken to jail. His father, Wayne Stanfield of Arlee, died Sunday in a motorcycle crash on Interstate 90 near Missoula. Craft's mother, Diana Cote, told The Spokesman-Review newspaper of Spokane the killer broke a window and entered her home near Pablo about 3 a.m., then attacked her daughter, pulled her outside and drove off with the young woman in a pickup truck. Cote, an enrolled member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribe who lives on the Flathead Reservation, also told the newspaper she believes the daughter's killing was racially motivated. "We're not ruling it (racism) out, but we have no motive yet," Salish and Kootenai tribal Police Chief Craige Couture said, adding that Birmingham refused to talk with detectives. Investigators said Wednesday that Birmingham was friends with Craft's boyfriend. Craft and Birmingham "knew each other vaguely," Undersheriff Jay Doyle said. Craft's brother, Shonto Pete of Spokane, Wash., told KREM Television there that Craft had been living with him and attending high school in Spokane for the past year. He said she was back in Arlee visiting family and friends when she was killed. "We sent her on a bus to visit her boyfriend, who had just returned from the war," Pete told KREM. "She was adamant. I didn't want her to go because she would miss some school." Pete said Craft's boyfriend, Tyler Vale, is "really confused and angry." "He has to go back to war in a week, and now he has to take this back with him," Pete said. Birmingham spent Wednesday at St. Patrick Hospital in Missoula, where he was taken after allegedly breaking a window and jumping out of a patrol car. Doyle said Birmingham would be transported to the Lake County Detention Center in Polson when he is released from the hospital.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/W/WA_HORSE_COMMUTE_WAOL-?SITE=OKPON&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT May 31, 2:32 AM EDT Employees commuting to work on horseback in Port Townsend PORT TOWNSEND, Wash. (AP) -- Behind a parking lot full of Jefferson Transit buses, Missy contentedly munches on grass in her new corral among berry brambles and wild roses. The chocolate brown Arabian mare with a long black mane became Desiree Williams' transportation to and from work at the bus company on Tuesday. "We used to just joke about it," Williams, a maintenance clerk, said from her desk in an office loft overlooking Jefferson Transit's bus maintenance bays at the corner of Upper Sims Way and Hancock Street. But Williams and her transit colleague Betty Mysak got more serious about riding to work after gas prices soared well past $3 a gallon. So why don't they ride the bus? "They're horse aficionados," said Transit General Manager Dave Turissini. "It gives them one more opportunity to ride." Transit employees already use a variety of alternative forms of transportation, such as bicycles and scooters to get to work, Turissini said, so horse power was a natural. "They put the corral up at their own expense," he added. On Tuesday, Williams rose at 5:30 a.m. to saddle up her 15-year-old mare and ride to work. It took her about an hour to travel the 4.5 miles from her home. She said Mysak planned to ride her quarterhorse, 31-year-old Cocoa, from her home in the Hastings and Howard streets area. As Williams sees it, a bale of hay costs $13 and lasts a week. That compares to $40 to $50 to fill up her Nissan six-cylinder pickup truck with gasoline. Also, horse power is almost entirely free of emissions, said Williams with a smile. "It's all biodegradable and it's all green," she said. The makeshift corral is on an undeveloped acre of Jefferson Transit's six acres. The only expense to transit is a little water for the animals. The horses are well behaved, Williams said. But, as a precaution, she and Mysak will stretch an electric fence wire on the corral. That's so the horses don't lean into the lightweight barrier and break it while stretching for a tempting bite of grass as they await the end of their riders' shifts.

"I will kill everyone at SCCC on May 31," said the message, found late last week in a men's restroom. "Faculty, staff and students are advised to use their best personal judgment about reporting to work and classes Thursday," school President Mildred W. Ollee wrote in a letter e-mailed to students and posted on the Web. "... If fear prevents you from coming to campus, accommodations will be made." College spokeswoman Laura Mansfield said she's heard from some people who said they won't be coming to class Thursday. "Every college gets these," she said, adding some faculty decided Thursday "would be a good day for a field trip." Seattle police planned to increase their visibility on campus Thursday, Mansfield said. The college has about 9,000 full- and part-time students. Information from: The Seattle Times,
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GATES_JOBS_WAOL-?SITE=OKPON&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT May 31, 2:33 AM EDT Gates, Jobs make rare joint appearance at technology conference CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) -- Legendary technology rivals Bill Gates and Steve Jobs made a rare joint appearance Wednesday and wasted no time making nice. "Bill built the first software company in the industry," said Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc. "Bill focused on software before anyone." Gates, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder, hailed Jobs for taking big risks and developing products with "incredible taste and elegance." "What Steve has done is quite phenomenal," Gates said. That set the tone for a 90-minute chat in which the two computer industry icons fielded questions from Wall Street Journal columnist Walt Mossberg and technology reporter Kara Swisher at the newspaper's "D: All Things Digital" conference. Jobs and Gates reminisced about early days working together in the 1970s, interspersing their views on the current state of technology. When Swisher asked for the greatest misunderstanding about their relationship, Jobs joked: "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now." Gates added: "Neither of us have anything to complain about, in general. It's been fun to work together." The two briefly discussed the 2008 elections. Gates said candidates should be measured on their ideas for improving education. Gates and his wife, Melinda, created the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, which is now the world's largest philanthropic foundation. The foundation gives a majority of its grants in the areas of world health, global development and education. Although the two companies worked together in the 1970s - Microsoft even invested in a struggling Apple in 1997 - they have remained fierce rivals. Gates dropped out of Harvard University in 1975 to found Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen and turned the company into the world's largest maker of computer software. Jobs and friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976, five years before IBM Corp. jumped into the personal computer market. Jobs left Apple in 1985 following a struggle with the company's board but made a triumphant return in 1997 when Apple was struggling to survive. Jobs is widely credited for Apple's renaissance with a string of innovative products - the iMac computer for consumers, the powerful PowerMac and PowerBook, and more recently, the iPod digital music player. Microsoft has long dominated with its Windows operating system and software programs like Word and Excel, but Apple scored big with its iPod, introduced in 2001, and its iTunes online music store. Next month, Apple introduces its much-anticipated iPhone mobile handset. Microsoft released the Zune music player in November to compete with iPod. An audience member later asked the two men what they learned from each other. "The way he does things is just different. It's magical," Gates said. Jobs said he admired Microsoft's ability to collaborate with other technology companies. "They learned how to partner with people really well, and I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well," he said.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/W/WA_NEUTRINO_LAB_WAOL-?SITE=OKPON&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT May 31, 2:39 AM EDT Lab buried under WA ski slope would tackle cosmic puzzles SCENIC, Wash. (AP) -- Deep in the granite thousands of feet directly below the Seventh Heaven chairlift at Stevens Pass ski area, white-suited scientists may one day walk through a series of dust-free chambers to figure out how matter came to exist in the universe. That's the vision of University of Washington physicist Wick Haxton. And sometime in the next few weeks, Haxton and the rest of the world will find out whether it's likely to come true. After the UW-led team twice appeared to be knocked out of contention, it now finds itself in the final stretch of a yearslong competition among four sites to build one of the world's deepest underground laboratories. The aim is to unlock the mysteries of an elusive subatomic particle called a neutrino. Scientists say the deeper they go underground, the better they can shield sensitive measuring equipment from the sun's interfering rays. Research on the neutrino, Haxton said, could "change our understanding of everything from the Big Bang onward." At stake is up to $300 million in National Science Foundation money to build the lab and $300 million to conduct the first round of experiments - not to mention bragging rights for any discoveries. But for the UW site, in a tunnel under Cowboy Mountain, to be picked, it would need to beat out the front-runner: the shuttered Homestake gold mine in Lead, S.D. And it's a competition the town of 3,000 is taking very, very seriously. In fact, each Feb. 23, when snowmobiles and skis are out in force, the townsfolk of Lead (pronounced LEED) put up banners along the main drag, organize feasts and judge an art competition. The celebration? "Neutrino Day." Compare that excitement to Washington, where the project has proceeded virtually unnoticed, especially since the UW abandoned an earlier, controversial attempt to put the lab in the Icicle Valley near Leavenworth. NSF spokesman Joshua Chamot said the agency expects to announce a preliminary site decision for its Deep Underground Science and Engineering Laboratory sometime next month. Then follows a three-year, $15 million planning study of the chosen site before the final go-ahead to build the lab. Haxton, 57, is one of perhaps 300 scientists in the country primarily studying neutrinos. It's a tight-knit group that, over recent years, found itself oddly divided into four camps over the lab-siting question. Haxton himself was an early leader of the push to locate the lab in Lead. But after the 8,000-foot-deep Homestake mine closed in 2001 and the new owners switched off water pumps, the lower levels were left to flood. The new owners also questioned whether some of the existing equipment could ever be used again, because of liability concerns. Those factors prompted Haxton to begin looking farther afield. He became convinced that tunneling under a mountain held better prospects than descending into a mine. Meanwhile, scientists in Minnesota and Colorado were promoting their own alternatives. The Soudan site in Minnesota would use a former mine that had already been converted into a lab; the Henderson site west of Denver would use a working molybdenum mine. The UW-led group began its quest for a lab with a team of power players in late 2003. But the initial plan to burrow under Cashmere Mountain and haul away thousands of truckloads of debris met strong resistance from Leavenworth locals and outdoors enthusiasts. In mid-2005, the NSF eliminated the UW and five other sites from the race, and at that point the quest appeared to lose momentum among UW and state leaders. But Haxton successfully appealed the elimination on the basis that the NSF had strayed from its scientific evaluation by considering cost and local objections. Haxton then switched his preferred site to Cowboy Mountain at Stevens Pass, and the NSF, taken by surprise, withdrew a $500,000 design grant. Undeterred, Haxton wrote and submitted a new design proposal in just three months. The new proposal would use the small Pioneer Tunnel on the west side of the Cascades. The tunnel was dug in the 1920s as an access and hauling route for crews constructing the Cascade Tunnel rail route. These days, it functions only as a water-drainage system. The tunnel would be widened to about 15 feet in diameter with rail tracks connecting to the main rail line. That would allow debris to be easily removed by rail and for loads up to 15 tons to be hauled into the tunnel, using battery-powered engines to reduce pollution. A main laboratory with about six rooms would be built 2 1/2 miles into the tunnel, under the peak of Cowboy Mountain. A hoist system would give access to a deeper set of rooms nearly 6,000 feet below the mountain peak. In the future, an even deeper third stage could be built 1 1/2 miles or more below the peak. The UW would rely primarily on NSF money to build the lab. Haxton added that private donations and state economic-development loans might be sought if the UW wins the competition. Marvin Marshak, a physics professor at the University of Minnesota who is leading that state's proposal, said many of his peers think the NSF has favored Homestake all along. He agrees that political considerations likely have played a part in NSF thinking but adds that Haxton's persistence in challenging the process may have forced the agency to become more evenhanded lately. "Wick is very determined, what can I say? He works very hard, extremely hard," Marshak said. "I'm sure that Homestake probably considers him to be the fly in the ointment." Haxton said his rail-based approach allows much heavier equipment to be hauled in more easily and the Northwest location puts the lab in the best position to receive neutrino beams fired from similar labs in Japan, Europe and the U.S. Homestake has the advantage of being the deepest proposal, with a proposed second stage 7,400 feet below the surface.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/W/WA_GLOBAL_WARMING_CONGRESS_WAOL-?SITE=OKPON&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT May 30, 7:25 PM EDT Inslee says U.S. could learn from Europe about global warming WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. Jay Inslee, on a weeklong trip to Europe, said that when it comes to global warming, the United States could learn from its counterparts across the Atlantic. "Frankly, on this one Europe's got it right, and we've got to join them," the Washington state Democrat said Wednesday in a telephone interview from Berlin, Germany. European countries have had both success and failure in tackling global warming, Inslee said. "Now we want to develop an American response to global warming that works and makes sense economically and is effective." Specifically, Inslee said lawmakers are studying a so-called cap-and-trade system that sets limits on carbon dioxide emissions while allowing companies to buy or sell pollution credits so total pollution levels meet a general cap. Inslee, who represents the Seattle area, is traveling with five other House members, including former Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., on a four-country trip to study global warming. Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., also is on the trip. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., is in Europe on a separate trip led by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. In a statement Wednesday, Walden said Congress will have to act on climate change in the current session. "Hopefully we can learn in person from the Europeans about what has and what has not worked for them," he said in an e-mail. "Their cap-and-trade system, for example, is being called into question for its fairness and effectiveness. We need to be smart enough to learn from the experiences of others." While the United States needs to do all it can to help the environment, "we must do so in a way that works for America and does not chase our jobs overseas or drive up utility rates on consumers," Walden said. Walden and Inslee are members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which organized the current trip. The bipartisan delegation met with industry leaders and government officials in Copenhagen, Denmark, over the weekend before flying to Berlin. The group is scheduled to go to Brussels and London before returning June 3. Inslee said he was fascinated by a tour of what could become the cleanest coal-burning plant in the world. The plant, in Brandenburg, Germany, is a pilot project aimed at capturing and storing carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power. The goal is to almost completely eliminate carbon emissions, producing clean energy that does not contribute to global warming. "It's an exciting development if they can burn coal cleanly," Inslee said. While in Germany the group also met with top advisers to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and members of parliament. "One clear lesson is that you can grow the economy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions at the same time," Inslee said, citing a proliferation of wind turbines and other "clean" energy in both Germany and Denmark. Turbines made in Denmark are being shipped to the Port of Tacoma and installed on wind farms in Washington state, he said. Inslee, who also serves on a special global warming committee, said he expects the energy panel to produce a bill on global warming this summer. Asked about Pelosi's trip, which includes visits to Greenland, Germany and Belgium, Inslee called it a happy coincidence. "This is the challenge of our generation," he said, referring to global warming. "It demands a level of intense personal and community dedication that really surpasses any other challenge we have at the moment - except Iraq of course." Having Pelosi visit Europe - generating headlines around the world - "is useful to bang the drum and blow the bugle" about the importance of global warming, Inslee said. He and other lesser known lawmakers "are down in the boiler room, and we produce the steam," he added. Others on the trip are Rep. Rick Boucher, D-Va., and Republican Reps. Fred Upton of Michigan and Marsha Blackurn of Tennessee.
