http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/uk/6708361.stm | Wife's martyr letter 'imaginary' GMT 14:41 martyr letter 'imaginary' Ms El Hor denies she urged her husband to become a terrorist A woman said a letter in which she apparently encouraged her husband to be a terrorist martyr was fantasy, a court has heard. Bouchra El Hor told police she wrote often and what she had said was "imaginary", the Old Bailey was told. It is alleged Ms El Hor, 24, of Ealing, west London, encouraged Yassin Nassari, 28, in a letter found in their luggage at Luton airport in May last year. The couple deny a total of three terrorism charges. Part of the letter, which was read to the jury, said: "Maybe one day I can follow you. If I can't, I will send our son to you so he can follow his father's footsteps. "I will pray to Allah to reunite us in heaven with our son and families." Aftab Jafferjee, prosecuting, said Ms El Hor told police she often wrote, "writing imaginary things like poems or letters referring to family and friends". He said she claimed the letter was written for herself and that it should be put in the context of her other writing, which depicted how men historically went off to fight in battles. Prosecutors claimed Ms El Hor said in the letter that she wished she could also be a martyr and promised she would one day send their baby son to follow in her husband's footsteps. They said the significance of the letter, found in the couple's luggage when they returned from a trip to Holland, was noted after missile-making instructions were found on Mr Nassari's computer. The prosecution allege Mr Nassari also had information on how to handle explosives and other material in preparation for an act of terror. Ms El Hor denies failing to disclose information on terrorism and Mr Nassari denies two charges of having documents and computer data for terrorism. The couple were married in London in March 2005 and have a one-year-old son. Ms El Hor is originally from the Netherlands, while Mr Nassari was born in London.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/europe/6707301.stm | Europe | Ukraine leader warns of snap poll GMT 14:43 leader warns of snap poll Ukraine's leaders have been involved in a bitter power struggle Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko says his political allies can trigger a snap poll if parliament fails to back a law calling for a September election. He said his allies would resign their parliamentary seats if the law was not passed, forcing the snap poll. He earlier extended until Thursday evening a deadline for parliament to finish debating the election law. Mr Yushchenko and his rival, PM Viktor Yanukovych, have agreed on the September election to end a stalemate. Their rivalry, dating back to 2004, has created a political crisis in Ukraine. Speaking during a day-long visit to Croatia, Mr Yushchenko said his allies would give up their seats in parliament if members did not approve the law within the new deadline. "So the election will be held automatically within 60 days - this is a clause in the constitution," Mr Yushchenko is quoted by the Reuters news agency as saying. Parliament had been asked to pass the measures by the end of Wednesday, but failed to do so in time, prompting Mr Yushchenko to extend the deadline by a day. The latest delay in parliament is reported to have been largely due to objections from Mr Yanukovych's supporters to the president's demand that MPs be prevented from changing parties once elected. Mr Yushchenko reached a deal on Sunday with his rival, Prime Minister Viktor Yanukovych, to hold an early poll in September and thereby end months of crisis. Mr Yushchenko dissolved parliament in April, accusing Mr Yanukovych of trying to usurp his power. MPs are considering laws on election financing, electoral commission reform and the former Soviet republic's bid to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The election deal was reached after a marathon 12-hour session of talks between the two leaders on Sunday. Mr Yushchenko became president in January 2005 following the pro-democracy Orange Revolution, which overturned a rigged victory for Mr Yanukovych. But Mr Yushchenko was forced to accept his rival as prime minister after his allies failed to win a majority in the March 2006 parliamentary election, and the two men have repeatedly clashed. The president favours closer ties with the West, while the prime minister is seen as more pro-Russian. rivals agree on poll date Ukraine court opens crisis case Yushchenko rethinks poll move Ukraine leader calls early poll In pictures: Ukraine stand-off Leaders agree on an election date, but the wrangling is far from over Ukraine's future looks less orange Ukraine's heroes turn into foes Q&A: Ukraine political crisis Prime Minister of Ukraine blames US in missile row Turkish MPs force reform showdown

The Duke and Duchess of Rothesay were joined by Queen Sonja of Norway at the museum, which has been 10 years in the planning at Lerwick Harbour. The museum uses much recycled material, with the reception desk made from a salvaged boat. A model of an extinct pig - which was the size of a large dog and had tusks - is also on show. The grice was indigenous to Shetland and can now be seen for the first time in more than 100 years thanks to researchers and a taxidermist. Boats have been suspended in mid-air as a major attraction. Elevated viewing platforms on each of the floors of the main building give visitors a series of views of the suspended boats.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6708115.stm Ireland | Abuse boss 'will report priests' GMT 14:24 boss 'will report priests' The man who is to oversee the Catholic Church's Irish child protection board says he will have no qualms about reporting any priest involved in suspected child sex abuse. Ian Elliott, who headed the NSPCC in NI, says the "independent role" follows a career dedicated to child protection. The 60-year-old has been "impressed by the efforts" within the church to confront the well-documented problem. "Obviously in an ideal world this role wouldn't be necessary," he said. "What we're about is motivating ordinary people within the church to play a vital role with regards to child protection. "It's not some small select group making policies to be implemented from behind closed doors." Commenting on the reporting of clergy if suspected of child abuse, Mr Elliott, who is an active member of Ballywillan Presbyterian Church, Portrush, said he would readily do so no matter who was invoved. "If there is the slightest suspicion a child is being abused or indeed has been abused at any time in the past, I of course will have no qualms about reporting the incident to the appropriate authorities," he continued. "As I have already said this is all about helping the church move beyond apology. "But perhaps most importantly I want to put across the message that child protection is everyone's business no matter what the organisation." Last October, Pope Benedict XVI told Irish bishops that they had to deal with the problems caused by priests who sexually abuse children. Bishop Colm O'Reilly, welcoming Mr Wilson's appointment said that "the church is extremely pleased to have secured a person of Ian's proven integrity, expertise and stature to head up this most important role at this moment in the church's history, north and south". The issue of clerical abuse has been a long-running issue across the island of Ireland. Most recently, the Catholic Church said nearly 150 priests and members of other religious orders have been accused or suspected of abuse since 1940 in the Dublin archdiocese. the latest breaking news delivered to your desktop or mobile device Catholics detail Irish sex abuses 02 Abuse claims 'against 26 priests' 27 Oct 05 | Northern Ireland Ireland nuns apologise for abuse 06 May 04 | Europe Priests discussing sex abuse levy 25 Feb 05 | Northern Ireland Poll finds Irish mistrust Church 04 Dec 03 | Europe TOP NORTHERN IRELAND STORIES Worthington set to be NI manager Sinn Fein's Policing Board debut NI man denies Turkey fraud claims

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hereford/worcs/6708379.stm | Hereford/Worcs | A first hearing for Elgar's last GMT 14:38 first hearing for Elgar's last The music is about "a disappointing love affair" The last piece of music ever written by the composer Edward Elgar is to have its world premiere this weekend on the 150th anniversary of his birth. The work, called X-T-C, was discovered by pianist David Owen Norris who will perform it at the Royal Academy of Music in London on 2 June. He said he pieced the music together from two sketches found at the composer's birthplace near Worcester. One of his best works is a highlight of the BBC's Last Night of the Proms. Pomp and Circumstance March No 1 is sung to the words "Land of Hope and Glory". Mr Norris told the BBC that the X-T-C piece is a nostalgic take on his feelings after a love affair. "Like most of Elgar's songs it's about his rather disappointing love affair with Helen Weaver and she fell ill and went to New Zealand to die, but in fact didn't die and haunted him for the rest of his life and many of his songs, like this one, are about how happy he could have been, if only," Mr Norris told BBC News. Elgar was born in 1857 in Lower Broadheath near Malvern, Worcs and died in 1934, the same year that two other great English composers died - Gustav Holst and Frederick Delius. His image was removed from the back of £20 notes earlier this year and replaced by Scottish economist Adam Smith.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6708395.stm | US economy weakest in four years GMT 15:11 economy weakest in four years Firms have been cutting down on their supplies The US economy grew at a pace of 0.6% in the first three months of 2007, its weakest rate in more than four years, official figures have shown. Hit by Americans importing more goods and firms cutting their supply stockpiles, the figure was a downward revision on the initial 1.3% estimate. The latest figure from the Commerce Department was also worse than market expectations of 0.8%. It was the slowest rate of growth since the final three months of 2002. Another significant factor for the weak showing was the downturn in the housing market, which posted a 15.4% reduction in new home building during the quarter. Weakness in the housing market is also hitting the US economy However, consumer spending remained resilient, adding 4.4%. And business investment was better than earlier estimates, growing 2.9%, revised up from 2%. "It looked like the market was starting to lean into the wind, anticipating a weak number, and we got a little sell-off when it did come in," said Michael Woolfolk, senior currency strategist at Bank of New York. "But it's quite obvious the economy bottomed in the first quarter and this leaves us with a better base from which to bounce back." Other analysts are also confident that the figures for April to June will be much better. "I think we'll see second-quarter growth above 3% and 2.5% for all of 2007," said Lehman Brothers senior economist Drew Matus. Earlier this week, minutes from the last Federal Reserve meeting showed that the central bank continued to see inflation as the "predominant concern" for the US economy. The Fed left interest rates unchanged at 5.25% at its last meeting on 9 May. In its minutes, the Fed added that the housing market downturn had been more severe than expected, but that the risk of the US economy slowing abruptly had lessened. Separate figures on Thursday showed that US construction spending rose by an unexpected 0.1% in April, led by public and commercial building work.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6706623.stm | Blair issues Africa action call GMT 14:22 issues Africa action call Nelson Mandela thanked Mr Blair for his support Blair speech in full Tony Blair has used a keynote speech in South Africa to say there is a "moral obligation" to use political action "to make the world better". Mr Blair, who promised more training for African peacekeeping forces and continued aid to the region, defended his interventionist foreign policy. That policy, criticised after the Iraq war, had not managed to transform Africa but had made it better, he said. Mr Blair is on his last big trip before stepping down as prime minister. He has denied the week-long tour, which has also taken in Libya and Sierra Leone, is a "vanity tour" - dismissing his critics as "cynical". Mr Blair is meeting South African President Thabo Mbeki, where Zimbabwe's political crisis will be on the agenda. He also held talks with South Africa's former leader Nelson Mandela, who thanked him "for his support over the years" and said he held him in high regard. However ferocious the challenges are in this part of Africa it's better to intervene and try to make a difference than stay out and try to cope with the consequences at a later time African media verdict on Blair In full: Blair speech In his speech Mr Blair, who has sent UK troops into action in Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq while prime minister, said it was in countries' self interest to intervene in failing states. He said: "I believe in the power of political action to make the world better and the moral obligation to use it. "I do not believe that in this time - the early 21st century - that international politics can be just about nations' interests, narrowly and traditionally defined. "I believe that now, today, our self interest is in substantial part defined by the well-being of others, that the consequence of globalisation is that our best chance of security and prosperity lies in advancing freedom, opportunity and justice for all." The Liberal Democrats described his speech as "trying to rewrite" his foreign policy legacy. Foreign affairs spokesman Michael Moore said the "high points" of Kosovo and Sierra Leone had been "completely overshadowed by the prime minister's disastrous misjudgement over Iraq". Africa is close to my heart... it has also been at the top of my foreign policy for the last 10 years. Blair role in arms deal And Professor Ian Taylor, an expert in international relations, told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme said Britain needed a stronger political engagement with African leaders and to ask "tricky questions" about governance. "It's not good enough simply to increase aid," he said. "What we have got now is a foreign policy which is much more focused on an economic approach to Africa's problems, rather than a political approach." Mr Blair has called on the G8 group of industrialised nations, meeting in Germany from 6-8 June, to be "bolder on Africa" and take a more strategic approach "based on partnership rather than aid alone". "My belief is that we have to stay with it for the long-haul, commit and re-commit. Never let it be said that we are not trying even if it cannot always be said that we are succeeding." Mr Blair was made an honorary paramount chief in Sierra Leone He also said Africa should have a greater representation at international institutions, such as permanent representation on the UN Security Council. On Wednesday, the prime minister held talks with President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah of Sierra Leone and Liberia's President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Afterwards he said: "However ferocious the challenges are in this part of Africa it's better to intervene and try to make a difference than stay out and try to cope with the consequences at a later time." The UK sent peacekeeping troops during to Sierra Leone in 2000, helping to end the country's civil war, which earned Mr Blair much popularity in the West African state. On Tuesday Mr Blair held talks with Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, saying relations between the UK and Libya had been "completely transformed" in recent years. In Thursday's speech, the main one of his trip, Mr Blair said: "Africa is close to my heart... it has also been at the top of my foreign policy for the last 10 years. "From the very beginning however, I wanted to base that policy on a new partnership with African leaders and countries - not one based on rich and poor or donor and recipient, but based on common values of justice and democracy and human rights."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6707711.stm | Warning as Eurotunnel shares rise GMT 13:35 as Eurotunnel shares rise Paris stock market regulator AMF has issued a rare warning to brokers taking orders for Eurotunnel shares after a sharp rise in the firm's market price. The watchdog warned such orders were irrevocable and brokers should check clients have enough money to buy stock. The warning suggests AMF fears the soaring share price may leave some investors unable to pay for shares they buy or deliver shares they have sold. Eurotunnel shares have almost tripled since resuming trading on Tuesday. Eurotunnel shares rose 92% in Paris on Tuesday and another 90% on Wednesday. Thirteen percent of Eurotunnel shares began trading on Tuesday after holders of the other 87% agreed a reorganisation plan for the company, which will cut its debt from £6bn (8.9bn euros) to £2.84bn. The Anglo-French firm had faced bankruptcy unless its plans were backed by at least 50% of shareholders. Under the plans the majority of shareholders agreed to exchange their old Eurotunnel shares for the new Groupe Eurotunnel shares, which will not make their stock market debut until next month. As a result, the only Eurotunnel shares to benefit from the firm averting bankruptcy will be the 13% still trading on the Paris bourse - in other words those owned by investors who rejected the reorganisation plan.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/tayside_and_central/6708113.stm | Tayside and Central | Farm worker jailed for sex crimes GMT 13:42 worker jailed for sex crimes Bryant was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh A former farm worker who had sex with a 12-year-old girl he met when she went to help out at stables has been jailed for eight years. Peter Bryant, 50, also had unlawful intercourse with the victim's 15-year-old friend after telling her he would teach her to ride a horse. Bryant previously admitted the offence against the 15-year-old which took place in Dunblane, Perthshire, in 1999. He also admitted having unlawful sex with the younger girl in 2002. That offence occurred at a house in Rothesay on the Isle of Bute. Bryant also admitted committing indecency offences with both girls and failing to appear at court last year. As well as being jailed, he was placed on the sex offenders' register. Passing sentence at the High Court in Edinburgh on Thursday, judge Lord Kinclaven said: "You have accepted responsibility for a number of serious sexual offences against two young girls. "Clearly there is no alternative to a significant custodial sentence." The court heard the younger girl made a complaint to police in 2003 and Bryant, who had moved to the Midlands, was arrested by police in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, in 2004. He was given bail at Stirling Sheriff Court but then failed to turn up for a court appearance. Bryant was arrested on warrant in London last year after returning from Portugal. Advocate depute John Halley told the court Bryant had initially denied the allegations but admitted he had had a sexual relationship with the older girl when she was 17. He said the girl had been helping out at a riding school for the disabled when Bryant arrived to collect a horse. Bryant suggested she come to the Stirlingshire farm, where he was employed as a manager, to help there. The court heard he later began kissing and cuddling the girl in a tack room at the farm and had sex with her. The younger victim was first molested by Bryant after she went to help out at the stables and he later had sex with her after he moved to a flat in Rothesay. Defence solicitor advocate David Brookens said Bryant, a first offender, had been the target for vigilante justice in the Midlands after his crimes had first emerged. Bryant was jailed seven and a half years for his sex crimes and a further three months for failing to appear at court. Lord Kinclaven said he would also refer Bryant's case to scottish ministers under child protection legislation for him to be included on a list of those unsuitable to work with youngsters. manager admits underage sex 14 Mar 07 | Tayside and Central TAYSIDE AND CENTRAL STORIES Farm worker jailed for sex crimes Staff sorrow as osprey chick dies Councils bid to cut CO2 emissions
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/6708179.stm | Hampshire | Drivers kept to 20mph near homes GMT 13:45 kept to 20mph near homes Portsmouth council will introduce a 20mph speed limit on Friday Motorists in Portsmouth will have to limit their speed to 20mph in the city's residential areas as part of a major new road safety initiative. The council says the new limit around most homes will protect all users of the city's narrow, congested streets. However, a spokesman admitted that the scheme will be "self-enforcing", with no additional resources allocated. Most of Portsmouth's main routes will not be affected by the lower limit which is to be brought in on Friday. Starting in the south east of Portsmouth, it will be extended across most of the city by the end of 2007. The government funded scheme follows a period of consultation which, the council says, showed that the majority of residents were in favour. It's a vital safety measure and we make no apology for bringing it in Traffic surveys will be carried out after six and 12 months to help monitor its success. If speeds have not dropped, residents will be asked whether they want extra action to be taken. Councillor Alex Bentley, executive member for traffic, praised the "bold step" and said the new speed limit will help to "change attitudes and make speeding an anti-social way to behave". He added: "It's a vital safety measure and we make no apology for bringing it in." Similar low-speed zones are already in place in other towns and cities across the south, such as Salisbury and Bournemouth. Portsmouth City Council, however, claims that its adoption of the 20mph limit is "a first" in terms of the extent of the area covered. travel news and more from the BBC's Hampshire website Primary wins 20mph limit battle 09 Jan 07 | South of Scotland Review of county's speed limits 23 Dec 06 | Hampshire 20mph speed limit plans for town 26 Sep 06 | Berkshire Twenty's plenty for city centre 24 Jul 06 | North East/N Isles Action Network - Road Safety mobile phone raid near M-way Rare donkey foals put up for sale Drivers kept to 20mph near homes
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6707729.stm | Americas | Cold forces Argentine energy cuts GMT 13:43 forces Argentine energy cuts Chile relies heavily on Argentina for natural gas Argentina has been rationing gas supplies as cold weather blamed for some 17 deaths continues to strain the country's energy system. Officials ordered that homes and small businesses be given priority for natural gas, with large industrial users told to cut back. Argentine officials said they hoped normal service would resume soon. On Monday, Argentina stopped exporting natural gas to neighbouring Chile but shipments have now been resumed. Parts of Argentina, including the capital Buenos Aires, have been experiencing near freezing temperatures this week. The strain on the country's energy infrastructure was exacerbated by technical problems at two nuclear power stations. "We have been prioritising supplies for family homes and businesses," the under-secretary for fuels, Cristian Folger, told the state news agency Telam. Restrictions on the sale of compressed natural gas for vehicles have also caused long queues at service stations, provoking protests among Buenos Aires taxi drivers whose cars run on the fuel. Correspondents say although Argentina's economy has been growing strongly in recent years, there has not been sufficient investment in infrastructure.

The raider demanded a set of car keys after confronting the victim inside her home in Bobtail Court, Duston, Northampton, in the early hours. When she refused to hand them over the burglar grabbed a set of keys to another car, which were on the floor near to the front door. He ran off towards Harlestone Road when confronted by the woman's husband. Three men had been seen acting suspiciously around a car parked on the driveway of the house earlier in the evening. The main offender was dressed in a light coloured two-tone hooded top with a half zip up the front, a dark balaclava and dark bottoms. The jacket's hood was up over the balaclava. The other two raiders were in their early to mid-teens.

A judge said Varsha Sabhnani, 35, and her husband, Mahender Sabhnani, 51, should remain under home detention pending the outcome of their trial. The Indian-born couple were arrested last week after one of the women escaped from their Long Island home. They pleaded not guilty to forced labour and harbouring illegal migrants. US District Judge Thomas Platt said the couple could be released from police custody on payment of bail set at $3.5m (£1.7m). They were to be confined to their home, and subject to 24-hour surveillance, telephone wiretaps and physical searches, the judge ruled. The couple, who run a perfume business, were arrested after one of the women was found wandering the streets dressed in only trousers and a towel. It is thought she escaped when she took rubbish out for collection the previous night. Lawyers for the accused said the couple spent a lot of time abroad and that the two Indonesian women were free to leave whenever they wanted. One of the women said they slept on mats in the kitchen The pair were described as "model citizens" who "only want to clear their name". Prosecutors described the case as "modern-day slavery" and said the two women were beaten, had scalding water thrown over them and were forced to eat hot chilli peppers. One of the women also said they had to sleep on mats in the kitchen and had no option but to steal food as their meals were so meagre. The couple also refused to pay the women directly, sending only $100 (£50) a month to a relative in Indonesia, officials said. The women, identified as Nona and Samirah, arrived in the US legally in 2002 but had their passports confiscated by the Sabhanis, officials said. Their visas have since expired. on US slavery charge 24 US urges new greenhouse gas goals US growth weakest in four years Russia blames US in missile row
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6705647.stm | Mother saw family diving deaths News in video and audio GMT 17:05 saw family diving deaths Richard Avent was a leading expert on historic Welsh buildings An archaeologist who introduced her husband and teenage son to diving has told how she watched them die on a holiday on the Maltese island of Gozo. Richard Avent, 58, and son Rhydian, 16, from Raglan in Monmouthshire, drowned during a dive last August. Dr Sian Rees said it appeared they forgot to exhale while ascending, causing their lungs to burst. Recording an accident verdict, the Coroner David Bowen said the tragedy could not have been foreseen. The court heard that Dr Rees, a marine archaeologist for Welsh heritage agency Cadw, began diving back in her college days. Her husband - a renowned chief inspector of ancient monuments with Cadw - had taken up an interest in diving and had trained in Croatia with their son, Rhydian. They went to Gozo on a diving holiday last August where they joined a group led by an instructor from a diving centre. They completed three dives without any problems. But on the fourth, Rhydian and Richard got into trouble. They had been told that the most interesting things to see were below 20m but that because of their relative inexperience, Mr Avent and his son would have to remain above that depth. Dr Sian Rees said the tragedy in her family was "indescribable" Experienced diver, Dr Rees - whose other two children were not with them - offered to stay with them but they told her to go with the rest of the group. She told the hearing that Mr Avent and Rhydian had given the OK signal three times during the dive. But then when she looked back, she saw them ascending and realised they were in trouble. Once she reached them, she said they were descending again. Rhydian's breathing regulator was no longer in his mouth. After managing to get Rhydian to the surface, she tried to resuscitate him but there was red foam coming from his mouth and she realised he was dead. The diving supervisor had attempted to revive Mr Avent with no success. Dr Rees said she assumed Rhydian had got into trouble and his father had tried to get him to the surface but in their panic, they had forgotten to exhale as they went upwards. I will have to live for the rest of my life with a perception of culpability in that I was present and will always feel that there must have been something I could have done to prevent this happening The inquest heard that Dr Rees had thought long and hard about why Rhydian had lost his regulator but no theory worked completely. It was possible he had switched off his air supply without realising when he got into the water or he may have become tangled with his father. She thought it unlikely the hose had been snagged on the rocks. Asked by the coroner whether her husband and son had been competent divers, she said you could only tell if someone was really competent by their reaction when something went wrong. Dr Rees, whose two older children had not been with them on the holiday, said she could not help blaming herself for what happened. "The tragedy that has befallen my family is indescribable and is all the more terrible in that it was avoidable," she said. "I will have to live for the rest of my life with a perception of culpability in that I was present and will always feel that there must have been something I could have done to prevent this happening." She also told the inquest she believes the Professional Association of Diving Instructors should review its safety guidance and consider introducing a probationary period for young or inexperienced divers. The association has issued a statement offering its condolences and says while they do all they can to minimise risks, diving will never be completely safe. Following the deaths in 2006, a post-mortem examination concluded that the pair died from barotrauma - pressure difference between lungs and the outside atmosphere - and drowning. At the time, First Minister Rhodri Morgan paid tribute to Mr Avent's "massive contribution" to the protection and conservation of Wales's historic sites and buildings. out more about what is going on across the region Funeral for holiday tragedy pair 12 Aug 06 | Wales Man and son drowned during dive 04 Aug 06 | Wales Tributes paid to castles expert 03 Aug 06 | Wales Man and son die on diving holiday 03 Aug 06 | Wales reveals assembly cabinet Mother saw family diving deaths 'Stolen' Aborigine apology demand
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/6707741.stm | Kent | Call for action after fatal crash GMT 14:11 for action after fatal crash A pregnant woman was involved in this accident in March 2003 Residents are calling for urgent action to improve a notorious stretch of road in Kent after an accident in which an 11-year-old girl died. She was a passenger in a car involved in a three-vehicle crash on the A258 between Dover and Deal on Sunday. "I arrived eight weeks ago and this is the third accident since then," said Swingate Inn landlord, Graham Dove. Kent County Council (KCC) said early indications were that the road was not a factor in the latest accident. Mr Dove said one of the pub's regulars died in an accident involving a car when he was walking along the A258 at the end of 2006 "It is a very, very busy road but I think it is country lane standard - narrow, winding with high hedges and we all drive far too fast down it," he said. Earlier last year, a baby had to be delivered by Caesarian section after the mother went into labour following a head-on collision. The road has a 50mph speed limit, with speed cameras, and improvements have been made to junctions and bends in an effort to cut accidents. Dover MP Gwynn Prosser said he was a frequent user of the A258. "I have seen lots of near misses and had some scary moments myself," he said. "I accept that some important improvements have been made but I am asking KCC highways department to make a new appraisal of the road." KCC said it offered its sincere condolences to the family of the 11-year-old girl. It added: "The police investigation into this tragic crash is at an early stage but they have indicated that the highway is not a contributing factor." sport, chat and more from the BBC website for Kent Girl, 11, dies in three-car crash 27 Pedestrian death driver quizzed 29 Dec 06 | Kent Baby born after crash is critical 27 Mar 06 | Kent Work to begin on improving road 13 Aug 04 | Kent for action after fatal crash Woman survives 100ft cliff plunge One dead and two injured in crash
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/europe/6707803.stm | Europe | Russia rebuffs West over Kosovo GMT 14:21 rebuffs West over Kosovo BBC South-East Europe analyst Kosovo's economy is struggling to emerge from the doldrums As the crunch time for resolving Kosovo's long-term status approaches, the war of words between Russia and the Western powers on the future of Serbia's independence-seeking province shows no sign of abating. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday "our positions are diametrically opposed and I don't see any chances of the positions moving any closer together". Russia has been opposing a draft resolution presented to the UN Security Council by the US and its EU allies, which would endorse a plan drawn up by UN special envoy Martti Ahtisaari for internationally-supervised independence for Kosovo. Attempts to bridge the gap on the draft resolution failed to make headway during talks that US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice held in Moscow in mid-May. Russia's publicly stated position is that a solution needs the approval of both parties. Mr Lavrov reiterated that point during a recent visit to Belgrade, after he met Serbia's President Boris Tadic. Russia's foreign minister wants more negotiations on Kosovo "Ultimate legitimacy can be reached through decisions that will be acceptable to both sides," Mr Lavrov said, "in this case, both for Kosovar Albanians and Belgrade". Since Serbia has rejected the Ahtisaari recommendations out of hand, that would imply that Russia might use its veto, as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council, to scupper the proposed supervised independence for Kosovo. The United States and - more reluctantly - the EU have endorsed the Ahtisaari plan as the best one possible, in the absence of an agreement between Belgrade and Kosovo's overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian community. No such deal emerged from a year-long series of talks Mr Ahtisaari chaired in Vienna until March. Meanwhile, Western governments are hoping that Moscow's disapproval does not necessarily mean it will veto a UN resolution. Russia's most senior officials - including Mr Lavrov - have tended to avoid using the term "veto", while hinting at its possible use. That has been viewed as an attempt on the Kremlin's part to keep its options open. However, in recent months - particularly since the emergence of the Ahtisaari proposals - Russia has adopted a firmer position in arguing for a settlement reached by consensus. It has made fewer attempts to establish an analogy between Kosovo and the pro-Russian breakaway regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia in Georgia. Last year President Vladimir Putin sought to highlight such a link, implying that if Kosovo gained independence, then so should these territories. Russia's opposition to the West over Kosovo does not appear to be motivated by a history of friendship with Serbia on grounds of a shared Slavic cultural background and Orthodox Christian heritage. After all, Russia pulled its peacekeepers out of Kosovo in 2003, despite the fact that the Serb minority there were complaining, as they still are, of being the victims of harassment and discrimination at the hands of the ethnic Albanian majority. Russia's early departure from Kosovo, justified on grounds of cost-cutting, was viewed by many Kosovar Serbs as leaving them in the lurch. The withdrawal from Kosovo four years ago was also in stark contrast with the unannounced arrival of Russian peacekeepers there back in 1999. The Russian dash to Pristina airport nearly produced a confrontation with the main body of the peacekeeping contingent under Nato's command which the Russian troops eventually joined, as originally agreed. Russia's conduct both in 1999 and today appears to be motivated by a determination to show the West, and the US in particular, that it should be taken seriously - as one of the key players on the international stage. The circumstances now are very different, though. Thanks to its oil wealth in an era of high energy prices, Russia believes it has regained its former status as a great power, which it lost during the economic collapse in the immediate post-communist era. Mr Ahtisaari failed to get a deal between Serbs and ethnic Albanians When it comes to the dipomatic battle of wills over Kosovo, that factor probably accounts for much more than Russia's sympathy for the Serbs - although support for fellow-Orthodox Serbs has a populist appeal to some sections of Russian society. The Kremlin might still decide to abstain in a vote - an option made easier by the fact that the text of the UN resolution, like the main section of Mr Ahtisaari's blueprint, does not include an explicit reference to "independence". Western diplomats also note that, until very recently, Russia played what they describe as a generally "constructive" role as a member - along with the US, Britain, France, Germany and Italy - of the six-nation Contact Group that has been spearheading the UN's drive to settle Kosovo's status. However, before the Kremlin reconsiders its stance it may be looking for some concessions, both on Kosovo and other issues. In the case of Kosovo, these could include a moratorium on the territory's membership of the UN and other international bodies once it becomes independent. Elsewhere, Moscow may be angling for an undertaking from Nato not to continue its enlargement into former Soviet republics by inviting Georgia, and possibly Ukraine, to join the alliance. Meanwhile, Washington has also signalled its readiness to bypass Russia, if necessary, by stating that it will recognise Kosovo's independence, even if there is no UN Security Council resolution in place to endorse it. Russia may want to avoid a confrontation of that kind, and it has repeatedly tried to put off the moment of decision by calling for more talks. But the US and key Western countries believe the time for further delays has passed. They are concerned about a build-up of frustration among Kosovo's Albanian majority - and unlike Russia, they have peacekeepers on the ground who may become the targets of possible violence. The last chance for a deal may now be just a few days away - at the G8 summit of leading industrial nations in Germany on 6-8 June. If Russia stands by Serbia, Kosovo's assembly will almost certainly vote for a unilateral declaration of independence. That would be a scenario for diplomatic upheaval and chaotic developments on the ground, which would present further challenges not only to the West but Russia as well. police arrest nationalists UN plans for independence Decisive step to statehood Russia rebuffs West over Kosovo plan Serb leader defiant on Kosovo Nato's 24-hour beat in Kosovo Kosovo Serbs face hard choices Your memories of a conflict Clubbing into a new Kosovo Kosovo's cadets forge ahead Flashback to Kosovo's war Will the new Kosovo work? 1999: Nato strikes timeline 2000: An uneasy peace blames US in missile row Turkish MPs force reform showdown
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/6708473.stm | Northamptonshire | Family plea for arsonists to stop GMT 17:05 plea for arsonists to stop Callum Bland, aged three, died from smoke inhalation The family of a toddler killed in a house fire in Northamptonshire has spoken for the first time of how the tragedy destroyed their lives. Callum Bland, aged three, died on 19 March in an arson attack on his home in the Fulmar Lane area of Wellingborough. His mother Jayne Fisher urged those carrying out arson attacks to "grow-up" and consider the consequences of their actions. "I just feel sorry for the family of whoever is doing it", Ms Fisher said. We have no memories or anything, they have all gone up in the house Paul Bonner, Callum's stepfather Paul Bonner, Callum's stepfather, said: "It's childish and immature. At the end of the day it could be another child that loses their life for the sake of a prank. "It's not just a bit of fun, they are playing with people's lives. We lost our home, we lost our son, we lost everything really." Mr Bonner added: "We have our three children and that is it. We have no memories or anything, they have all gone up in the house." Callum's mother and stepfather gave their first interview as police appealed for information about a spate of wheelie bin fires in neighbouring Cambridgeshire. The toddler who was asleep, was unable to escape with the rest of the family when the fire broke out. Ms Fisher, Mr Bonner, and three other children, aged from five months to five years old, managed to escape the blaze. A man aged in his 30s from Wellingborough, who was arrested in April as part of a police investigation into the fire, has now been released without charge. Three people remain on police bail in connection with a series of other fires on Wellingborough's Hemmingwell estate.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6708245.stm | Alliance Boots takeover approved GMT 15:17 Boots takeover approved Alliance Boots says it aims to get a new pensions deal Alliance Boots shareholders have approved an £11.1bn buyout by private equity firm KKR and deputy chairman Stefano Pessina. A total of 96% of Alliance Boots shareholders backed the deal. It is the first time a FTSE 100 company firm has been bought by a private equity firm. The firm expects the takeover to be complete in July, although it remains in talks with pension trustees over future pensions provision. KKR first approached the Boots board in March with an offer for the firm. A bidding war briefly broke out when an investment consortium led by Guy Hands and Terra Firma made an offer for the pharmacy chain, but KKR increased their offer by £500m, which forced their rivals out of the race. Earlier on Thursday, the head of the Alliance Boots pensions fund attacked the firm for backing the deal before an agreement had been reached on future pensions provision. We have made it clear that the borrowings taken on to finance the acquisition will affect the (pension) scheme John Watson, Chairman of the trustees of the Alliance Boots pension scheme John Watson, chairman of the trustees of the health and beauty group's pension scheme, made the comments ahead of the shareholder vote on the takeover. He is worried that the debt being taken on by buyer Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR) may jeopardise the scheme. Alliance Boots said it was urging KKR "to come to some arrangement". "The fact of the matter is that the Boots' pension fund is one of the best run and best funded schemes in the FTSE 100 index," said Alliance Boots chairman Sir Nigel Rudd. "You have my assurance that I will be pressing very hard for an agreement." The pensions scheme's trustees have already intimated that a current review of the fund may show a £305m deficit. They are pushing for KKR to put up to £1bn extra into the scheme. While the trustees have no power to veto the Boots takeover, if an agreement with them is not made it will be the first time that a FTSE 100 company has changed hands without the approval of its pension fund trustees. "We have made it clear that the borrowings taken on to finance the acquisition will affect the scheme," said Mr Watson. The Alliance Boots pension fund has 66,000 members, including 16,000 employees who are still making contributions.

More than 1,800 drivers were found to be over the limit in the year to April 2007, jumping from the figure of 1,107 in the previous year. The new Deputy Chief Constable Adam Briggs described the increase as "a totally unacceptable number". The force is to begin a major crackdown, including surprise checks. Mr Briggs said: "Driving plus drink or drugs equals deadly danger. It is as simple as that." He said the 1,834 drivers and riders found over the limit in the county last year was unacceptable. "That means that every day there are five drivers or riders who feel they have the right to gamble with other people's lives. That attitude cannot be tolerated." Throughout next week officers will be breath-testing all drivers and riders involved in crashes, mounting extra patrols and setting up surprise stop-checks across the county. sport, chat and more from the BBC website for North Yorkshire NORTH YORKSHIRE STORIES Big rise in drink-drive figures Man quizzed over woods sex attack UK beach hygiene hailed in report

Can I create my own BBC News feeds? What are News Feeds? News feeds allow you to see when websites have added new content. You can get the latest headlines and video in one place, as soon as its published, without having to visit the websites you have taken the feed from. Feeds are also known as RSS. There is some discussion as to what RSS stands for, but most people plump for 'Really Simple Syndication'. In essence, the feeds themselves are just web pages, designed to be read by computers rather than people. How do I start using feeds? In general, the first thing you need is something called a news reader. This is a piece of software that checks the feeds and lets you read any new articles that have been added. There are many different versions, some of which are accessed using a browser, and some of which are downloadable applications. Browser-based news readers let you catch up with your RSS feed subscriptions from any computer, whereas downloadable applications let you store them on your main computer, in the same way that you either download your e-mail using Outlook, or keep it on a web-based service like Hotmail. Once you have chosen a news reader, all you have to do is to decide what content receive. For example, if you would like the latest BBC News Entertainment stories, simply visit the Entertainment section and you will notice an orange button on the left hand side. If you would like the latest BBC News World video stories, visit the Video and Audio section of the BBC News Website (www.bbc.co.uk/newsvideoaudio ) and click on the button at the bottom of the World section. If you click on the RSS button you can subscribe to the feed in various ways, including by dragging the URL of the feed into your news reader or by cutting and pasting the same URL into a new feed in your news reader. Most sites that offer feeds use a similar orange button, but some may just have a normal web link. Some browsers, including Firefox, Opera and Safari, automatically check for feeds for you when you visit a website, and display an icon when they find one. This can make subscribing to feeds much easier. For more details on these, please check their websites. Other News Readers (GOOGLE) do I get a news reader? There is a range of different news readers available and new versions are appearing all the time.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6707775.stm | Europe | Excerpts: Lugovoi news conference GMT 14:29 Lugovoi news conference Andrei Lugovoi, the man suspected of poisoning ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, has held a news conference in Moscow. Here are excerpts of his statement. ON THE BRITISH SECRET SERVICES' ALLEGED INVOLVEMENT IN THE POISONING "It's hard to get rid of the thought that Litvinenko was an agent who got out of the secret service's control and was eliminated. Even if it was not done by the secret service itself, it was done under its control or connivance." Asked if there was evidence of their direct participation, Lugovoi said: "There is." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING RECRUITED AS A BRITISH SPY Mr Lugovoi said in 2005 Mr Litvinenko invited him to London where he proposed the idea of starting a joint business. Mr Lugovoi went on to say that he was paid too much money for giving minor consultations to British business partners. "It became clear that the fee was aimed at gradually engaging me in co-operation. The talks were becoming more open. The British started to show interest in everything: my connections, financial opportunities, if I had direct access to the Russian president's administration, as well as contacts with officers of the Federal Security Service, the Federal Bodyguard Service and the Foreign Intelligence Service. They were especially interested in an opportunity to get information about the FSB activities in the so-called English direction. "They openly begun to recruit me as a British intelligence agent. The British, in essence, suggested that I gather any discrediting information about President Vladimir Putin and members of his family. For example, it was proposed that I gather information about a state official, through whom they intended to get discrediting information about the president. In particular, they intended to lure this state official to London in order to get discrediting information about the president in exchange for silence about his personal bank accounts. I will tell investigators of the prosecutor-general's office who I'm talking about. "For maintaining an undercover connection, I was given a British mobile phone, which I was supposed to use for calling from Moscow to London. From bad to worse: Litvinenko gave me an edition of Yevgeny Grishkovets' book Rubashka and told me that now we have to use cipher like in spy movies and to encode a text using numbers of pages, paragraphs and lines. "One has to be a complete idiot not to understand that under the pretext of developing a joint business, a banal recruiting was going on with concrete political and intelligence goals with regard to Russia and its president. "I do not regard myself a passionate supporter of President Putin and I have my personal reasons for that, which many can guess about. But I was taught to defend the motherland, not to betray it. During another meeting with Litvinenko, I told him straight everything I thought about that and said that I was not interested in such business." ON ALLEGEDLY BEING MADE A SCAPEGOAT Mr Lugovoi said the British had already made up their minds that he was guilty of killing Mr Litvinenko. "For a long time I was constrained by my obligations to the Crown Prosecution Service. I was willingly co-operating with the crown prosecutor's office and I was answering every question. I was also answering all the questions that the Scotland Yard investigators were asking me. Even then I had a feeling that all the questions were just a formality and the accused were already determined, that is myself and Dmitry Kovtun. But I tried to keep all the obligations... and I was made a scapegoat." He said the British had hoped he would stay silent, but that he was not going to allow them to push their agenda. "Just think of it: they have found a Russian James Bond, who enters into nuclear centres and in cold blood poisons a friend of his and, at the same time, poisons himself, his friends, children and wife. And all that was done single-handedly by the terrorist Lugovoi. Who - as a result - loses his business and clients. And the main question: what for? Where is the motive for my crime? "London was hoping that I would keep silent as I have not been extradited... and that all the questions would resolve themselves: I would be branded as a criminal; Berezovsky would get a very good reason not to be extradited to Russia; Scotland Yard and the British special services would save face in the eyes of their taxpayers; while Russia and its leadership would be discredited for a long time. "Only none of this will happen. I am prepared to lose even more money, but I will fight for my honest name. I understand that if I went to London, I - for the sake of preserving somebody's professional honour - would be convicted, no matter what. That is why in the very near future, as we have done before, I will hire serious lawyers in London in order to defend my honest name in the British law-enforcement agencies. "If the British authorities refuse to conduct a fair trial, I will be prepared to appeal to the international court in The Hague." ON WHY HE BELIEVES THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM ARE WRONG "Now I would like to return to the issue of [Litvinenko's] death. First, I don't think you have to be a lawyer to understand that a motive is needed to carry out a crime like this. Sasha [Litvinenko] was not my enemy. I did not have any opinion on what he was doing in London, which books he was writing and who he was criticising. I have been a businessman for a long time now, and this didn't really interest me. "Second, for some reason all British newspapers are saying that the poisoning took place on 1 November, but Litvinenko and I met twice in October. Moreover, we met in his home in summer, when his wife Marina was away. By the way, Berezovsky didn't know of that meeting. It was almost the ideal place for a poisoning. However, when conditions were ideal, it didn't happen. But in a bar with a lot of people, when he could have failed to turn up, in the presence of dozens of witnesses, it happened. This means that someone wanted us to be seen together in the Millennium Bar. "Third, those who know Sasha can confirm that he never drank or smoked. Neither I nor Dima [Dmitry Kovtun] can remember whether he ordered anything, tea or water, because we were preparing to go to a football game at the time and, since it was cold, had drunk a good amount of spirits. What kind of idiot poisoner would it take to act in such a primitive way? Again, somebody wanted to set us up. "Fourth, if the poisoning took place on 1 November, then how did the polonium leave traces [changes track], I underline, it only left traces in places in London where I and Litvinenko met in October. And why was the polonium found in aircraft on which Dima and I returned to Moscow and Germany respectively in October 2006? My only conclusion is that we were purposely marked with polonium in order to use us in a political scandal later. "[Fifth,] I came to London with my wife and children to go to a football game. As a consequence, all of them were checked for polonium poisoning and the results were not comforting. They were tested together with me in the hospital. What kind of monster would you have to be to expose the lives of your children and your wife to such threats? "Sixth, already in summer 2006 Litvinenko started giving me various little gifts. When I was tested in the hospital, all my things were checked. It turned out that souvenirs and a number of documents which Litvinenko had given me long before 1 November were splattered with polonium. I told our investigators in the Prosecutor-General's Office about this, but they said that their British colleagues weren't interested for some reason. It is possible that Litvinenko himself left the traces (of polonium), but this theory was unacceptable to the British justice from the very beginning. "Seventh, it is no longer a secret that all my meetings with Litvinenko were thoroughly followed by the UK secret services. Why didn't they follow up Litvinenko's poisoning and allow all of us to leave Britain without punishment? Why has the address where we met British agents, [names omitted], not been included among the dozens of places in London mentioned in the media where polonium has been found? I would like to know whether polonium traces was found in that office, which is in essence one of their secret meeting places."

In the last two years the authority has adopted 30 roads, at a cost of £2.6m. A further £5.2m has been set aside for the next four years. After a street is adopted - with the approval of at least 50% of residents - the council takes responsibility for its future maintenance. The council said the move would see road standards improve dramatically. Councillor Andrew Cater, who is responsible for highways, said: "This investment programme is a clear signal of the council's intent to improve the road network across the city. "The success of the programme has meant there is now a waiting list for roads to be adopted but we are working as quickly and efficiently as we can to complete as many as soon as possible." travel, leisure and much more from the BBC website for Leeds WEST YORKSHIRE STORIES Five consortia lodge Leeds intent City's £8m pledge to fix potholes Lindsay website gets 7,000 hits
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/6707621.stm | Africa | Zambia's Chiluba 'to stand trial' GMT 14:47 Chiluba 'to stand trial' Mr Chiluba's suits were paid by public funds, a UK judge has said Zambia's ex-President Frederick Chiluba is to stand trial on corruption charges in Zambia, a Lusaka court has ruled. Magistrate Jones Chinyama rejected arguments that Mr Chiluba, 64, was too ill to be prosecuted for stealing $488,000 during his time in office. He suffers from a heart condition and was discharged from hospital on Tuesday after collapsing at his home last week. Earlier in May, a UK court ordered Mr Chiluba to pay back $39m of state funds he allegedly took while in power. The civil action was brought in Britain because the allegedly stolen money passed through bank accounts in London. UK Judge Peter Smith said Zambians should know that when the former president appeared wearing his trademark designer clothes, they were paid for with public funds. Mr Chiluba, who served two terms as Zambia's president from 1991 to 2001, denounced the verdict in the civil case as "racist" and "obscene". His handpicked successor, President Levy Mwanawasa, has been pursuing an anti-corruption drive against Mr Chiluba's former government. The president has offered to pardon Mr Chiluba if he admits the allegations and returns 75% of the cash he allegedly stole, but the ex-leader has always denied the allegations. The court said Mr Chiluba's trial should go ahead after doctors recently examined him in hospital. Last November, the trial was postponed to allow Mr Chiluba to travel to South Africa for medical treatment. is 'stable' in hospital 25 Chiluba attacks 'racist' UK court 10 Zambia's Chiluba guilty of graft 04 Zambia's Chiluba unfit for trial 17 Nov 06 | Africa Chiluba fury at seizure of suits 14 Mar 05 | Africa Chiluba's legacy to Zambia 19 Dec 01 | Africa 29 Nov 02 | Country profiles issues Africa action call Nigeria militants set conditions Zambia's Chiluba 'to stand trial'
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/scotland/6708135.stm | Alex Salmond makes hot seat debut GMT 14:45 Salmond makes hot seat debut BBC Scotland news website Alex Salmond faced questions from political rivals You know the old saying - ask a stupid question . . . And so was the case as Scotland's new leader Alex Salmond made his debut in the hot seat at First Minister's Question Time. During his grilling in the Scottish Parliament on all the hot issues of the day, those seemingly pointless questions normally asked by rival party leaders began to take on a new meaning. Former First Minister Jack McConnell got the first crack at his successor, who now sits in the Scottish Labour leader's old seat. Mr McConnell, who now sits in Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon's old seat, began by asking when the next cabinet would meet, a traditional FMQ opening shot. Mr Salmond, who has yet to receive a congratulatory call from Tony Blair on his new job, replied: "I thank Jack McConnell for not asking me when I last met the prime minister". Someone had to ask the question though, and it was indeed posed by Scottish Tory leader Annabel Goldie, who by the way has not changed seats. Alex Salmond said he had been congratulated by the queen Mr Salmond lamented: "He never phones, he never writes . . . " "The first minister's Downing Street dancing partner is nothing if not coquettish," offered Miss Goldie. In fact, Mr Salmond went on to say he had been congratulated by a variety of people, from Her Majesty the Queen to the Rev Ian Paisley. Once the questioning got under way, Mr McConnell, in a mocking echo of the SNP's campaign slogan, told Mr Salmond: "It's time - it's time for clarity." Mr McConnell, who put in a good performance considering his new circumstances, accused the first minister of failing to answer questions on transport, adding that Scotland had endured "a week of spinning" by the SNP on a variety of issues. But Mr Salmond hit back at his arch political rival, quipping to MSPs: "Jack's questions are longer than his answers used to be." The new first minister was in his element, but perhaps slightly more subdued than he has previously been seen - but a glimpse of the old Alex was still there. appeal after hit-and-run Death driver 'was visiting grave' OAP billed for home's demolition
