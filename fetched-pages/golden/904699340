http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/somerset/6707869.stm | Open verdict in punch death case GMT 13:38 verdict in punch death case Mr Toogood suffered fatal brain injuries A coroner has apologised to the family of a man who died after a fight with youths as he put out his bins. Alan Toogood, 50, suffered fatal brain injuries from a punch to his neck outside his Yeovil flat last September. An open verdict was recorded as there was insufficient evidence to find any other verdict, the inquest at Wells Coroners' Court was told. Coroner Tony Williams apologised to Mr Toogood's family, saying he was unable to come up with another verdict. Mr Toogood's eldest daughter, Yvonne Merrett, said the family was "disappointed". "We are still left with questions and it is upsetting, she said. "It is fair to say we are disappointed with the verdict but accept the coroner had no other option." The inquest heard Mr Toogood had confronted a group of teenagers because he was fed up with loud music outside his home. A 15-year-old youth, a boy and a girl, both 16, and an 18-year-old man were originally arrested on suspicion of murder. The Crown Prosecution Service did not press charges because of a lack of evidence. A 15-year-old boy, who admitted throwing a punch, refused to answer any questions at the inquest. But in a police statement read at the hearing, he admitted hitting Mr Toogood because he was being held by the throat.

Kate and Gerry McCann, from Rothley in Leicestershire, spoke briefly to the Pope as he met selected worshippers after his weekly audience. Afterwards, Mr McCann said the meeting had been a positive experience for him and his wife. Madeleine disappeared during a family holiday in Portugal on 3 May. Her parents, who are devout Catholics, flew to Rome from the Algarve resort of Praia da Luz in tycoon Sir Philip Green's private jet. The general audience given by Pope Benedict XVI takes place every Wednesday and is held in St Peter's Square during the summer months. About 25,000 people were at the audience attended by the McCanns. Mrs McCann showed the Pope a photograph of Madeleine when she met him, which he blessed. He put his hand on the arms of both parents during the emotional meeting. In ordinary circumstances it would be a highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope At a later press conference, Mr McCann said: "Today, meeting the Pontiff was an experience that has caused very mixed emotions for us. "In ordinary circumstances it would be a highlight for any Catholic to meet the Pope. Of course it's saddened by the marked realisation that our daughter is still missing. "We know people everywhere are praying for our daughter and that helps sustain our belief that we can get her back safely." Mr McCann said the goodness that had been generated by "one evil act" had restored his faith. The McCanns reiterated their appeal for information on Madeleine and urged people to visit their website, www.findmadeleine.com. The McCanns, both 38, are staying at the residency of the British ambassador to the Holy See, Francis Campbell. They have left their two-year-old twins in the Algarve with Mr McCann's sister, Trish Cameron, and her husband Sandy, deciding they were too young to take on the trip to Italy. The couple are also due to visit Spain, the Netherlands, Morocco and Germany to raise awareness of their daughter's disappearance. This week the family released the last video clips taken of their daughter before her abduction. Meanwhile, Portuguese police have received hundreds of calls after they released a description of a man seen near the McCanns' holiday flat. But the family said on Tuesday that police had got a crucial fact wrong in the description of the man. The height of the man given on the Portuguese press release was 170cm (5ft 7in) but it mistakenly appeared as 5ft 10in in the English version. meets parents of Madeleine Giant Madeleine poster unveiled Suspect details 'too vague' Sighting significant say family 'No-one feels more guilt' What next for the Portuguese police inquiry?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/devon/6703331.stm | Ex football club chairman jailed 30 May 2007, 17:47 GMT 18:47 football club chairman jailed John Russell (l) and Mike Lewis pleaded guilty The ex-chairman of Exeter City Football Club has been jailed for 21 months for fraudulent trading. John Russell, 51, from West Yorkshire, and his deputy Michael Lewis, 65, from Swansea, both pleaded guilty to fraud. Before being appointed chairman in 2002, Russell falsely claimed he had assets which could be used as personal guarantees for the club's debts. Lewis was sentenced at Bristol Crown Court to 200 hours of community work for playing a lesser part in the fraud. Russell, of Cannon Hall Close, Brighouse also pleaded guilty to obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception. A former Scarborough FC chairman, Russell had claimed to own a hotel, property and businesses. Paul Dunkels, prosecuting, said: "He was broke. He had no assets, no money and no bank account and certainly had no money to invest in Exeter City." Russell and Lewis, from Loughor Road, Gorseinon, continued trading and paid themselves generous consultancy fees despite knowing the club was insolvent and unable to repay loans. The court heard how they moved money from accounts to buy themselves time, cheques were bounced and money earmarked for the club's academy was illegally transferred. They left the club £4.5m in debt, but the men blamed the previous regime for the club's position. In sentencing Russell, judge David Ticehurst told him he had betrayed the club's fans and treated it as his own personal domain. During the pair's time in charge, singer Michael Jackson was made an honorary director of the club, and visited the club's St James Park with Uri Geller, who was appointed vice chairman. They said they believed they were caught after Uri Geller reported them to the police. The supporters' trust later took over the club and agreed to pay back 7p in the pound to creditors. leisure, environment Exeter FC trial moved from city 22 Dec 05 | Devon Ex-club chiefs appear in court 18 Feb 05 | Devon Club directors face fraud charges 11 Feb 05 | Devon Michael Jackson's thriller of a Devon visit Devon and Cornwall Police in profits for water company MP fined for disabled parking Waiting over for would-be buyers

The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) review said on balance the powers under the Terrorism Act 2000 are "necessary". More details about how they are being employed, and revised guidelines for Met officers, will be released at a Metropolitan Police Authority meeting. New powers to allow police to stop and question suspects are currently being considered by the government. These powers would be similar to those already used in Northern Ireland and anyone refusing to give their name or explain what they were doing could be fined up to £5,000. STOP AND SEARCH POWERS 22,672 stops were conducted by the Met between September 2005-6 As a result, 27 arrests were made for terrorism-related offences 95% of people stopped are men An Asian person is 30% more likely to be stopped than a white person None of the 19 complaints made since 2000 have been upheld The results of a review into how the police use counter-terrorism stop and search measures in London are to be presented to the Metropolitan Police Authority on Thursday. Members will hear how officers must be able to stop people without reasonable suspicion, in some circumstances. Len Duvall, chair of the MPA, said protecting the capital needed the support of residents as well as the government. He said there was clear evidence that section 44 powers were undermining community trust and reducing understanding of police counter-terrorism work. "While there is profound support across all communities for the police's counter-terrorist effort, there is also a real fragility to public trust in the authorities," he said. "If the Metropolitan Police is to tackle terrorism effectively, it must harness this community support and recognise this fragility." features More stop and quiz terror powers 27 and search powers 'damaging' Rings musical halted by accident

http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/athletics/6707395.stm BBC SPORT | Athletics | Radcliffe contract still unsigned GMT 11:18 contract still unsigned Radcliffe is one of Britain's most successful athletes Paula Radcliffe has still not signed a central contract with UK Athletics (UKA), even though the deadline expired almost a year ago. Radcliffe has not put pen to paper on the deal, meaning she is not eligible for lottery funding or allowed to run in the Norwich Union Grand Prix season. The disagreement relates to Radcliffe's own sponsorship deals, and her wish to choose her own race programme. Rising star Emily Pidgeon, 17, is also still to sign the contract. The complicated deal has several controversial clauses, including a ban on public criticism of UKA officials and athletes. Speaking last year, Pidgeon's father Stephen complained that the contract was weighted in favour of UKA. "If you read the terms of this contract there are parts of it that, as a businessman, I would never sign," he told BBC Gloucestershire. "If somebody brought a contract like this to me I would throw it out because they were being unreasonable." UK Athletics said it is confident of reaching agreement with Radcliffe as negotiations continued. We are not overly fazed by it and I don't expect Paula is either UKA chairman Ed Warner "Paula has a complex range of contractual obligations to a number of sponsors," said UKA chairman Ed Warner. "The standard UKA contract imposes its own contractual obligations and reconciling those is a very important issue for Paula and her team, which I completely respect. "We don't have any other athletes with that level of achievement. And, by extension, we don't have any other athletes with that range of financial commitments that go with her genuinely super-world-class status. "It is always the risk when individual athletes in any sport become mini-business empires. We live in a commercial world and that is the situation here. "We are not overly fazed by it and I don't expect Paula is either." The deadline to sign the contract officially expired on 28 June last year. Meanwhile, it is still unclear when Radcliffe will return to competitive action after she suffered a stress fracture to her spine while giving birth to her daughter Isla in January. "She is a genuine world class athlete. She will race when it is appropriate to do so for her long-term goals - I will certainly not be rushing her back into a GB vest," said UKA performance director Dave Collins. "She will have targets for Beijing and beyond and I will facilitate her in that. "She has committed to performing in Beijing and I am very excited that she has committed to performing in 2012 and it is up to us to give her the framework to do that."

Cowley-based Oxford Speedway has been pulled from the Elite and Conference leagues with "immediate effect" by its owner Colin Horton. Mr Horton said he had lost thousands of pounds since buying the club last year and could no longer bankroll it. The riders of both the Cheetahs and Lions teams are said to have already been looking for new clubs. If I could see even the smallest glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel I would have carried on Mr Horton said it was with "dismay" that he made the decision. But he added that he did not have an endless supply of money to sink into the club, which has been racing since 1939. "I have thought long and hard about this and it really is the toughest thing I have ever had to do," he said. "If I could see even the smallest glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel I would have carried on, but I can't.

Mr Shapps said figures were only available for patients aged over 65.

It follows a fire at the town's fire station in 2006. "The ambulance service nearby must be wondering what is going to happen to them," Nick Herbert said.

Www.lindsayannhawker.com was set up by her parents Bill and Julia, from Brandon, near Coventry. It aims to help catch the only suspect, Tatsuya Ichihashi, 28, who has not been seen since Japanese police approached him at his Tokyo apartment. Miss Hawker's body was found there buried in a bathtub of sand in March. Julia Hawker told BBC News: "The Lindsay Ann Hawker website's been set up both in English and Japanese and basically we're making an appeal to anybody, anywhere in the world, who knows any information as to the whereabouts of Tatsuya Ichihashi, the only suspect in the case." She added: "In real terms somebody can't hide away forever and he must be hiding somewhere. "Lindsay was a fantastic girl. Anybody who knew her and a lot of people did know her, would realise just how important it is to try to bring this man to justice." The Hawker family said most messages received via the website, which was set up on Sunday, had been from British ex-pats living in Japan. Tatsuya Ichihashi "can't hide away forever," Julia Hawker said A spokeswoman for the family said they were hopeful of receiving significant leads once the website was launched in Japan with a series of interviews next week. Any information received will be passed on to the Japanese police via their British counterparts. Miss Hawker, 22, had travelled to Japan to teach English as a foreign language. The Leeds University graduate was strangled and asphyxiated, post-mortem tests suggest. She had also suffered severe injuries to her face and arms. UK police are helping their Japanese counterparts in the search for Mr Ichihashi. Earlier this week, her parents revealed that Mr Ichihashi's father had sent them an apology via Japanese police and had called on his son to "atone for his crime".

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/manchester/6706343.stm | Appeal over vanished businessman GMT 06:26 over vanished businessman Mr Al-Hafeed has not been seen by his family for a year Greater Manchester police have issued a fresh appeal for information about a 38-year-old businessman who disappeared a year ago. Sarwar Al-Hafeed was last seen by wife Dana on the morning of 31 May, 2006, as he was preparing to leave their Didsbury home to go to work. Police fear the Iraqi father-of-three may have been abducted following a dispute with business associates. He had been involved in a dispute over money and title deeds to land in Iraq. In August his wife of 14 years offered a £500,000 reward for information leading to his safe return. On the day that he disappeared, Mr Al-Hafeed was going to Ducie Court, in Manchester city centre, where he worked as executive director of social housing organisation Leadstay. He was wearing a blue denim shirt, black canvas trousers and a khaki jacket when he left the house. Greater Manchester Police said it was extremely out of character for him to go missing and his bank accounts and mobile phone had remained untouched since his disappearance. Detectives are also keen to trace his car - a blue Ford Escort, registration number P87 RWX - which they believe may have been spotted on the day he went missing. We need to give his family some peace of mind to help them to move on with their lives Detective Superintendent Ian Foster It was reported being seen parked next to a white van on Mauldeth Road close to the junction with Parrswood Road. The doors to the van were apparently open and it was parked in such a way that pedestrians may have struggled to get past it. Detective Superintendent Ian Foster said: "It is now a year since Sarwar's family had any contact with him and we are still keen for any information on what happened to him. "Previous appeals have given us some lines of inquiry and we have been following them up, but we are still keen to speak to anyone with any further information on his whereabouts. "We can still not rule out the possibility that Sarwar went away of his own accord, although this would be extremely out of character for him. "I would like to make an appeal to Sarwar, or anyone who knows where he is to come forward with further information. "We need to give his family some peace of mind to help them to move on with their lives."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/6704201.stm | Ambulance service merger approved GMT 12:31 service merger approved Staffordshire ambulance chiefs have formally agreed to merge with the West Midlands service. The move still needs to be ratified by the strategic health authority and the government, but both are expected to be a formality. Both ambulance services were told by the government last year that they must merge at a time to be agreed locally. The merger, which sparked a 5,000 signature petition in protest, is expected to take place on 1 October. Staffordshire Ambulance Trust did not join the West Midlands service when it was created in 2006 amid fears that it would damage its response times. The West Midlands organisation was formed when the Hereford and Worcester, Coventry and Warwickshire, West Midlands trusts, which also covered Shropshire, merged last year. The government had set both trusts certain targets before the merger could be approved. These included responding to 75% of life-threatening incidents within eight minutes and 95% within 19 minutes. They also had to demonstrate clinical performance for heart attack patients, good sickness absence levels among staff and sound finances. Staffordshire Ambulance Service Chairman Robert Lake said: "I recommended that my board approve the merger timetable for a number of reasons. "It is clear that the two trusts are operating at a similar level of performance and are now the top two performing services in the country in terms of response targets. "Where there are areas of difference the gap is closing rapidly and there are action plans in place to ensure that change continues. "The West Midlands has introduced working practices that have proven successful in Staffordshire and vice versa. It is a two way process."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/lincolnshire/6707507.stm | Seized Elvis goods go to auction GMT 11:36 Elvis goods go to auction Julie Wall stole the money over a 10-year period Rare Elvis records, Christmas cards and magazines bought by a former council employee who embezzled almost £600,000, are to go on sale in Derbyshire. Julie Wall, 47, from Rippon Drive in Sleaford, Lincs, was jailed in October 2005 for three years for stealing the money from North Kesteven Council. The Crown Prosecution Service said the money raised from the sale would go back to the council as compensation. The sale takes place on 10 June at the Derby Auction Rooms. Wall stole nearly £598,000 over a 10-year period when she was working as a cashier for the local authority, sometimes pocketing up to £10,000 a month. The crime only came to light when an internal audit revealed more than £500,000 was missing from council funds. The Elvis memorabilia was seized under the Proceeds of Crime Act and the CPS has organised the auction. "Our message to all those who commit any crime for financial gain is that when they are caught, they not only run the risk of a prison sentence but they will also be stripped of the full profits of their crimes," said Gary Balch, head of the CPS confiscation unit. "Ms Wall paid approximately £500,000 for the collection but she was prepared to pay anything she was asked to for the items and sometimes the prices were a little silly. "It's unlikely we'll recoup the full amount owed but all items have been valued for auction and we're confident we'll get the best possible price for them."
