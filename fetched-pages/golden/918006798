http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/world/europe/31naples.html garbage dumps anger rises as fast as May 29 — Business at Pizzeria Napoli Nord is down 70 percent, and no one has the slightest doubt why: The reasons include eggshells, scuzzy teddy bears, garlic, hair that looks human, boxes for blood pressure medicine, moldy wine bottles — all in an unbroken heap of garbage, at places 6 feet high, stretching along the curb to the pizzeria’s doorstep. Skip to next paragraph you see all this trash, you don’t have much desire to eat,” said the owner, Vittorio Silvestri, 59, who, like most people in and around Naples these days, is very angry at his leaders. For a dozen years, Naples and surrounding towns like this one have periodically choked on their refuse, but the last two weeks have flared into a real crisis, as much political as sanitary: trash began piling high in the streets as places to dump it officially filled up. Then, on Saturday, the last legal dump closed. As the piles rose and the stench spread, fires burned some nights — one of many trash-related protests that included, inevitably, mothers clutching rosaries on railroad tracks. And while a patchwork of emergency measures has eased the crisis in the past few days, even the beleaguered men whose job it is sympathized. “The people are right,” said Guido Lauria, in charge of sanitation for a large section of the city, including the Soccavo neighborhood, where his workers cleared away heaps of garbage. “You smell this. People have children, but animals come, then insects. And then they complain.” The problems around Naples, a city long defined by both its loveliness and its squalor, are complicated, raising worries about tourism, inequity in southern Italy and the local mafia, the Camorra. But put simply, the bottom line seems the failure of politics, never a strong point here. As trash dumps filled over the years, it proved impossible to find new places or ways to get rid of garbage, largely because of local protests or protection by one politician or another. But years of postponing the problem finally caught up with Naples (and by bad luck just as the temperature rose, creating as much stink as unsightliness). “This is a situation that is tied to the incapability of the political structure,” said Ermete Realacci, an environmental expert and member of Parliament for the center-left Daisy Party. Namely, he said, politicians of all stripes have been unwilling “to make strong choices” to build new dumps or incinerators. And so, as the world’s news media fixed on trash fires burning in the streets, the nation’s president, Giorgio Napolitano, issued an unusual “extremely energetic appeal” to all levels of government and to politicians of the left, right and center finally to solve the crisis. At stake was not just public order, he said, but “the image of the country.” The president’s office normally holds itself above daily politics. But in this case Mr. Napolitano, a courtly native of Naples, used his prestige to persuade the residents of one town — led by one devout and praying woman called La Passionaria di Parapoti — to allow a closed local dump to be reopened for a brief 20 days. That, combined with several other temporary measures, is allowing Naples and the surrounding communities to finally begin digging out — and to lower tempers a little, too. Already the center of Naples, amid worry about the risk to a tourist trade it depends heavily on, seems largely clean, and in the last few days, the sanitation department has clicked into an emergency mode that has cleared away an impressive amount of trash. But the dumps are temporary, the fires have not stopped and much trash remains, compounding longstanding problems in the poorer south of Italy, especially in the peripheral neighborhoods of dingy high-rises already plagued by drugs and the Camorra. On Tuesday in Scampia, most dangerous neighborhoods, drug dealers sat across the street from a Dumpster spilling over with construction debris and unidentifiable mushy rot. “It’s never been like this — I can’t tell you why,” said Sabato D’Aria, 37, owner of a small grocery nearby. Politicians, he said, only “talk, talk, talk, but in the end you see very little.” “Unfortunately, here in the south we are always more penalized. Italy is divided.” There is also the problem of the Camorra, which profits extraordinarily in the endless crisis over trash, much as arms dealers thrive in war.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/world/middleeast/31haditha.html PENDLETON, Calif., May 30 &#151; Two Marine junior officers, in testimony made public on Wednesday, said they had no reason to suspect a possible war crime when they inspected the human carnage, women and children, after an infantry attack that killed 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha in 2005. But First Lt. Alexander Martin, suggested that killing of civilians &#151; which followed a roadside bomb blast that killed one marine and wounded two others &#151; was that Haditha residents became noticeably more helpful, if not quite friendly, to the Americans. &#8220;After 19 November,&#8221; Lieutenant Martin said in videotaped testimony, referring to the day the civilians were killed in 2005, &#8220;I had people coming up to me to tell me where the I.E.D.&#8217;s were.&#8221; I.E.D. stands for improvised explosive device, or officer testifying, First Lt.

Frank, offered a detailed and gruesome accounting of the human remains &#151; children and two women on one bed &#151; that the officers saw in three homes that had been attacked by a squad of infantryman searching for insurgents whom they suspected of detonating the introduced on Wednesday, both videotaped in March because the officers were to return to Iraq, came at a hearing for Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, a former commander of the Third Battalion, First Marines, who is one of four officers charged with dereliction of duty for failing to investigate the Haditha killings properly. In his own videotaped testimony, Marine prosecutor that each of the eight bodies he found on the bed had &#8220;multiple holes&#8221; in it, and that one child&#8217;s head was missing. But Lieutenant Frank repeatedly said in his testimony that he had never considered the possibility that a war-crime violation had occurred, the legal threshold under Marine Corps regulations that compels an episode to be reported to a superior officer. &#8220;It was unfortunate what happened, sir,&#8221; marine prosecutor, Lt. Col. Sean Sullivan, &#8220;but I didn&#8217;t have any reason to believe that what they had done was on purpose,&#8221; he said who killed the civilians in a house-to-house attack after coming under fire from insurgents. He said he and other officers had agreed to portray the deaths to Haditha town leaders as an unfortunate and unintended result of local residents&#8217; allowing insurgent fighters to use family homes to shoot at passing American patrols. After returning to the Marine base near Haditha on the evening of Nov. 19, 2005, Lieutenant Frank said, another officer, First Lt. Adam P. Mathes, told him that the Marines should not issue an apology for wrongfully killing civilians but offer a less conciliatory statement. Lieutenant Frank said Lieutenant Mathes, the company&#8217;s executive officer, advised a Marine major assigned to a civil affairs unit that &#8220;the best way to explain this to the Iraqi people&#8221; would be to tell them, &#8220;It&#8217;s an unfortunate thing that happens when you let terrorists use your house to attack our troops.&#8221; Lieutenant Frank, who testified after being granted immunity from prosecution in the Haditha case, said he complained to the company commander about the way that marines were forced to photograph and collect the 24 bodies. The marines had only four or five body bags at the base and used them of the dead civilians, said Lieutenant Frank. The children&#8217;s remains were placed in trash bags, he said. When the marines&#8217; four-Humvee convoy carrying the bodies arrived at a local hospital morgue that evening, Iraqi workers reacted in horror and some vomited at the sight, he testified. on Haditha Panel Peer Into Fog of War Marine Refused Staff's Advice On Iraq Deaths, Major Testifies Says Civilian Toll In Haditha Was a Shock Dropped Against Marine United States Armament and Defense
