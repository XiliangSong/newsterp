http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7746867.html Ford predicts rise in retail sales predicts rise in retail sales AM PDT DETROIT (AP) - A Ford Motor Co. official predicts that his company's overall U.S. sales will drop in May, but its retail sales to individual buyers will show a year-over-year monthly increase for the first time since October of 2006. George Pipas, Ford's top sales analyst, told reporters Tuesday that the increase, which includes only the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands, would be fueled largely by rising sales of new crossover vehicles. He said overall sales, which include those made to rental car companies and other fleet buyers, would drop by a single-digit percentage when compared with May of last year. Ford is trying to cut low-profit sales to rental car companies, and Pipas said that would drop about 20 percent in May from the same month last year. Pipas based his retail sales prediction on data collected through Monday night, but he would not predict the size of the increase. "The way things are progressing, it could well be our highest level of retail sales since August of last year," when the company was trying to clear out vehicles at the end of a model year, he said. The better retail sales results are due to rapidly rising sales of the Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX crossovers, which are vehicles that can do the things a truck-based sport utility vehicle can but are more fuel efficient because they are built on car underpinnings. The two new crossovers should help Ford's crossover sales grow 70 percent when compared with last May, when Ford, Lincoln and Mercury had only three crossovers, the Ford Escape and Freestyle and the Mercury Mariner, Pipas said. Pipas also predicted that U.S. sales will rebound a bit from a low April, due largely to increased sales of crossovers and small cars because of high gasoline prices. Automakers will release their May sales data on Friday. Most others do not comment until the data is released.

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7746882.html Ex-Ernst & Young partners accused of tax fraud conspiracy & Young partners accused of tax fraud conspiracy AM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - Four current and former partners of the giant accounting firm Ernst & Young were charged Wednesday with tax fraud conspiracy and other crimes relating to tax shelters that helped the wealthy escape taxes on incomes exceeding $10 million. All four worked in a group set up by the company in 1998 to develop tax shelters, according to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. They allegedly defrauded the Internal Revenue Service from 1998 through 2004 by designing, marketing and selling fraudulent tax shelters. U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement that the indictment targets "tax professionals whose deceit costs this country untold millions in tax revenues." An Ernst & Young spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. It was not immediately known who would represent the four men at court appearances later Wednesday. The indictment said the partners knew that if the IRS detected use of the tax shelters by their clients, it would aggressively challenge the claimed tax benefits. To hide the tax fraud from the IRS, the defendants created documents containing false and fraudulent descriptions of the clients' motivations for entering into the transactions, the indictment said. The partners enticed clients to participate in the shelters by getting law firms to provide letters claiming that the tax shelter losses or deductions would "more likely than not" survive IRS challenge, the court papers said. The four knew the opinions were based on false and fraudulent statements but believed they would undermine the ability of the IRS to determine the clients' tax liabilities and decide whether penalties should be imposed, according to the indictment. The partners were seeking entry into the highly lucrative tax shelter market that was already being explored by other companies, the indictment said. Those charged were identified as Robert Coplan, 54, a Plano, Texas, lawyer who once was a branch chief in the IRS' Legislation and Regulations Division; Martin Nissenbaum, 51, of Brooklyn, a lawyer; Richard Shapiro, 58, of Rye Brook, N.Y., also a lawyer, and an accountant, Brian Vaughn, 39, of Calhoun, La. They were charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS, tax evasion, making false statements and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the IRS.

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7746917.html Qatar Airways signs new contract for more A350 jets Airways signs new contract for more A350 jets AM PDT PARIS (AP) - Qatar Airways extended a much-needed boost to Airbus on Wednesday, ordering another 20 A350s to become the European jetmaker's largest customer for the wide-body jet with a total order of 80 planes worth a listing price of $16 billion. The agreement was signed by Qatar Airways President Akbar Al Baker beside new French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Qatari Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. The A350 is Airbus' challenger to Boeing Co.'s 787 long-range, mid-sized aircraft. "It's one of Airbus' biggest ever orders," said Airbus Chief Executive Louis Gallois, also present at the signing. He said that other orders could be in the pipeline. The Qatar Airways agreement for 20 A350-800s, 40 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s, as with most large orders, would likely come with deep discounts from the listing price. The agreement replaces an earlier one for 60 A350s signed in 2005. Airbus has been losing customers for mid-sized jets to U.S. rival Boeing and was forced last year to launch a costly redesign of the planned A350 to compete with Boeing's 777 and 787 Dreamliner, due to enter service in 2008. The European planemaker has bet heavily on future demand for superjumbos to serve increasingly congested airports worldwide. Yet its large A380 craft has been beset by legal, technical and managerial problems. Two years of accumulated delays to the 555-seater A380 have wiped more than 5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) off Airbus' profit forecasts for 2006-2010. It also has also been suffering from a falling dollar - the currency in which it sells its planes. The commitment for 20 extra planes brings Airbus' total orders for the A350 to 268. Of those, there are firm orders for 71 A350-800 and 33 A350-900. Airbus is forecasting the first commercial delivery of the A350 will be in 2013. Gallois said Tuesday that Qatar has expressed an interest in investing in Airbus parent European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. NV. Sarkozy has vowed his government will seek new investors for EADS, seeking changes to the shareholder pact as existing shareholders Lagardere SCA and DaimlerChrysler AG try to reduce their holdings. The French state owns 15 percent of EADS, while Paris-based Lagardere owns 7.5 percent. Their combined stake is balanced by German holdings of Stuttgart-based DaimlerChrysler and a consortium of private and state-run investors. Qatar, in the Persian Gulf, sits atop the world's largest field of natural gas. Natural gas exports are financing a rapid expansion of the capital, Doha, and bankrolling the state-owned airline. A tourism boom in the Middle East is contributing to the region's air traffic growth. Airbus claims its A350, made from carbon fiber wings and composites will be lighter per seat and more economical than existing crafts. Boeing's 787 is expected to enter commercial service next May. To date, Boeing has racked up 568 orders for the 787, which it says will be 20 percent more fuel-efficient than comparable jets. Shares in EADS fell 1.1 percent to 22.98 euros ($30.94) in Paris.

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7751992.html Ballmer: Microsoft won't make a cell phone Microsoft won't make a cell phone PM PDT PM PDT NEW YORK (Dow Jones/AP) - Microsoft Corp. has no plans to create a cell phone, preferring to focus on expanding its share of the market for cell-phone software, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said Wednesday. "I don't actually think it will make sense for us to make a cell phone," Ballmer said, speaking at The Wall Street Journal's "D: All Things Digital" conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Though he conceded that he once said the same thing about creating a music player, Ballmer said the better strategy for Microsoft is to partner with major handset makers. "There will be an operating system that sits in every phone," he said. "Will they come from us or someone else?" Apple Inc. is expected to introduce its first cell phone, the iPhone, soon. Ballmer said the company "is very committed" to its music player, the Zune. The device launched in November, but has so far failed to make much of dent in Apple's domination of the market for digital music players. Ballmer said the company will expand the Zune line, which he characterized as bare-bones, in an effort to get into the market quickly. "We'll have a lineup this Christmas that will be more exciting," he said.

AM PDT DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said Thursday that it ordered 27 Boeing 737-800s valued at $1.9 billion. All of the new single-aisle Boeing Co. aircraft will be fitted with technology that reduces fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions. They will be delivered between September 2009 and March 2010.

The order brings Ryanair's total firm orders for Boeing 737-800s to 308 and total fleet size - including planned disposals - to 262 by 2012.

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7765342.html Wachovia to buy A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion in cash and stock to buy A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion in cash and stock AM PDT CHARLOTTE, N.C (AP) - Wachovia, the nation's fourth-largest bank, said Thursday it would acquire A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion in cash and stock in a deal to form the second-largest retail brokerage firm in the United States. The combined brokerage unit will operate as Wachovia Securities, headquartered in St. Louis, and will have more than 3,300 brokerage locations nationwide, more than $1.1 trillion in client assets and nearly 15,000 financial advisers. Other A.G. Edwards businesses, including research, underwriting, investment banking, mutual funds and trust, will be consolidated into Wachovia's existing operating lines. "We believe A.G. Edwards is the premier independent brokerage company in the United States," Ken Thompson, Wachovia's chairman and chief executive, told analysts on a morning conference call. "When you combine A.G. Edwards with Wachovia Securities, we truly have an endgame player in the brokerage business." Wachovia Corp. said A.G. Edwards shareholders would get 0.9844 Wachovia shares and $35.80 in cash for each A.G. Edwards share held. That offer values A.G. Edwards Inc. at $89.50 per share based on Wednesday's closing prices, a 16 percent premium. Wachovia shares fell 30 cents to $54.25 in morning trading. A.G. Edwards shares jumped $10.66, or nearly 14 percent, to $87.81. "The long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia, and we have long expressed our interest in growing this business both organically and through acquisition," Thompson said. The deal continues a string of high-profile acquisitions engineered by Charlotte, N.C.-based Wachovia, including First Union, Prudential Securities and, most recently, Golden West Financial Corp. That $24.2 billion deal, which closed in October, expanded Wachovia's mortgage business, an industry that had slowed at the time of the buyout, and gave the company a foothold in California, a state where it had just a handful of branch offices. By adding A.G. Edwards, Wachovia will gain thousands of brokerage customers they can target for traditional banking products, including mortgages, deposit accounts, auto loans and credit card services. "The demand for our clients to have one-stop financial services ... this is critical as we move into the future," said A.G. Edwards Chairman and CEO Robert Bagby. The transaction, which is expected to close in October, with full integration by early 2009, makes Wachovia the second-largest American retail brokerage by number of brokers, after Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., and propels Wachovia past Citigroup Inc.'s Smith Barney. Wachovia Securities will become the third-largest brokerage by assets and number of branches. "While Wachovia has made strides to be among the top retail brokerages with its acquisition of the Prudential brokerage operation, it was never considered in the big leagues with Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney & Morgan Stanley," said Robert Ellis, senior analyst at Celent, a Boston-based financial research and consulting firm. "So, like most acquisitions, this one has an aspect of ego attached." Several analysts questioned Wachovia's ability to retain A.G. Edwards' financial advisers, who have the existing relationships with the customers that Wachovia is after. "We believe Wachovia's willingness to move Wachovia Securities headquarters to St. Louis may have overcome a sticking point for A.G. Edwards with other potential suitors and could help alleviate some of the cultural challenges that arrive through the deal," wrote Banc of America Securities analyst John McDonald in a research note to clients. Over the past four years, Wachovia has lost about 3 percent of its advisers through attrition. The bank said it does not see that number changing, but has set aside more than $1 billion for broker retention over the next six years, said David Carroll, head of Wachovia's capital management group. "We have a lot to offer our brokerage advisers and we think we can make it economical for them," Carroll said in an interview. Wachovia said Daniel J. Ludeman, currently president and chief executive of its Wachovia Securities unit, will keep those roles at the combined brokerage unit. Bagby will be chairman of the brokerage.

"The demand for our clients to have one-stop financial services ... this is critical as we move into the future," said A.G. Edwards Chairman and CEO Robert Bagby. The transaction, which is expected to close in October, with full integration by early 2009, makes Wachovia the second-largest American retail brokerage by number of brokers, after Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., and propels Wachovia past Citigroup Inc.'s Smith Barney. Wachovia Securities will become the third-largest brokerage by assets and number of branches. "While Wachovia has made strides to be among the top retail brokerages with its acquisition of the Prudential brokerage operation, it was never considered in the big leagues with Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney & Morgan Stanley," said Robert Ellis, senior analyst at Celent, a Boston-based financial research and consulting firm. "So, like most acquisitions, this one has an aspect of ego attached." Several analysts questioned Wachovia's ability to retain A.G. Edwards' financial advisers, who have the existing relationships with the customers that Wachovia is after. "We believe Wachovia's willingness to move Wachovia Securities headquarters to St. Louis may have overcome a sticking point for A.G. Edwards with other potential suitors and could help alleviate some of the cultural challenges that arrive through the deal," wrote Banc of America Securities analyst John McDonald in a research note to clients. Over the past four years, Wachovia has lost about 3 percent of its advisers through attrition. The bank said it does not see that number changing, but has set aside more than $1 billion for broker retention over the next six years, said David Carroll, head of Wachovia's capital management group. "We have a lot to offer our brokerage advisers and we think we can make it economical for them," Carroll said in an interview. Wachovia said Daniel J. Ludeman, currently president and chief executive of its Wachovia Securities unit, will keep those roles at the combined brokerage unit. Bagby will be chairman of the brokerage. sitter accused of raping baby boy The Schrammie: Michael Schreck, time to fess up Two dead in Eatonville crash Police: 'Missing' naval officer not missing Microsoft shows off 'coffee table of the future' Ken Schram: I'm sorry School evacuated after plumber finds body in air conditioning duct Miss USA booed at Miss Universe pageant Rosie O'Donnell says she may never speak to Elisabeth Hasselbeck again 'King of spam' arrested in Seattle
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7765367.html Smaller, trimmer Northwest Airlines steps out of Chapter 11 protection trimmer Northwest Airlines steps out of Chapter 11 protection AM PDT MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Northwest Airlines Corp. is emerging from Chapter 11 a little smaller, a lot more efficient, and with some of the lowest costs among the major carriers. Northwest shares were set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday morning, with CEO Doug Steenland ringing the opening bell, marking the end of a wave of airline bankruptcies that began after the Sept. 11 attacks. Northwest has slashed debt by $4.2 billion, cut $400 million a year in the cost of its fleet, and trimmed unprofitable routes. It cut labor costs by $1.4 billion a year, too, in a bruising four-year fight with its unions that did nothing to erase Northwest's reputation for terrible labor relations. On Wednesday, flight attendants and pilots in St. Paul protested executive pay by rallying around a giant inflatable rat clutching bags of money in its paws. Northwest's 400 top managers are set to get a collective 5 percent equity stake in the reorganized company worth an estimated $297 million. "They're going to have dramatically different economics post-bankruptcy, which is the good news," said Vaughn Cordle, who runs number-crunching firm Airline Forecasts and is an airline pilot. "The bad news is they've beaten down labor so much that they've got morale problems." Like the rest of the airline industry, Northwest has been on a roller coaster the past decade. On Sept. 10, 2001, the airline industry was coming off the 1990s economic boom, as business travel rose and fuel prices stayed low. U.S. airlines raked in around $5 billion a year in profits from 1997 through 1999 and almost $2.5 billion in 2000, according to government statistics compiled by the Air Transport Association. But Sept. 11, the slowing economy, and the run-up to the Iraq war hurt business travel, and rising fuel prices hurt airline profitability. Northwest was also hurt by the SARS scare in Asia, where it and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines are the two largest U.S. carriers. Eagan-based Northwest and Delta Air Lines Inc. both filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 14, 2005, putting four of the nation's seven largest carriers into Chapter 11. At the end of 2005, Northwest's costs were higher than every other airline except U.S. Airways Group Inc., according to government figures. By the end of 2006, when most of the airline restructuring was finished, Northwest's costs were lower than those at U.S. Airways, Delta, and Continental Airlines Inc., though still higher than costs at AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and arch-competitor United. Labor costs per mile flown, meanwhile, are now lower than at those carriers and only slightly higher than at Southwest Airlines Co., Cordle said. (Southwest workers still make more on average than Northwest employees.) Cordle said Northwest has done an excellent job reducing its costs in bankruptcy. But he worries that Northwest's debt, while lower than it was, is still higher than is healthy - especially considering that Northwest's fleet is old and that it will soon be spending money to upgrade it. Northwest plans to emerge from bankruptcy with roughly $9.2 billion in debt. But it also plans to spend $1.4 billion this year and almost $1.8 billion next year adding to its fleet, including the addition of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner next year. "Northwest may have shed $4 billion in debt, but they're still an over-leveraged airline," Cordle said. Moody's Investors Service rated Northwest's debt one notch higher than Delta's when Delta emerged from bankruptcy last month. Moody's analyst George Godlin said Northwest's routes in Asia and its relative dominance in the Midwest justified that. Delta, meanwhile, is reshuffling its domestic routes and adding international flights, including new routes to Africa, which may take time to become profitable, he said. "We felt that sticking to the knitting and doing things that they do really well" will give Northwest an advantage, he said. One advantage Northwest will have is that its new labor contracts lock workers into lower pay rates and more company-friendly work rules through the end of 2011, longer than any of its U.S. competitors. Flight attendants, for instance, now see their pay top out at about $35,400 a year, down from $44,190 before Northwest filed for bankruptcy protection, according to the union. Flight attendants Trevor and Amanda Olson of Andover, Minn., have felt that pinch. They met on a Christmas shift on a DC-10 and began dating a few months later. "Northwest has been good to us in that one regard," said Amanda, who is now on maternity leave. "In every other regard we've been having things taken away and taken away and taken away." "We're both considering new careers and looking for new jobs," she said at the rally Wednesday over executive pay. "One of us has to leave. We just have decided we both can't stay. It's not within our budget to both be here. We're worth more than what we're being paid." Steenland acknowledged that workers are upset in a hot line message to employees earlier this month. "For many, these prospects in the restructuring are bittersweet, because as exciting as they are, they have been made possible only at significant cost," he said. "We must honor these sacrifices through a careful and caring stewardship of our airline and its future." Even with the restructuring by the major carriers over the past five years, it's still a volatile business and no one is ruling out future trips to Chapter 11. "I can see that the next economic downturn may not be as severe as Sept. 11, but it's going to put a lot of pressure on them again," airline consultant Alan Sbarra said of the industry in general. "I think the big lesson everyone should learn from this is that the industry has not fundamentally changed."

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7765397.html Economy grows by just 0.6 percent grows by just 0.6 percent AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) -The economy nearly stalled with growth slowing to a pace of just 0.6 percent. That was the worst three-month showing in over four years. The new reading on the gross domestic product, released by the Commerce Department Thursday, showed that economic growth in the January-through-March quarter was much weaker. Government statisticians slashed by more than half their first estimate of a 1.3 percent growth rate for the quarter. The main culprits for the downgrade: the bloated trade deficit and businesses cutting investment in supplies of the goods they hold in inventories. "We are still keeping our head above water - barely," said economist Ken Mayland of ClearView Economics. For nearly a year, the economy has been enduring a stretch of subpar economic growth due mostly to a sharp housing slump. That in turn has made some businesses act more cautiously in their spending and investing. The economy's 0.6 percent growth rate in the opening quarter of this year marked a big loss of momentum from the 2.5 percent pace logged in the final quarter of last year. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke doesn't believe the economy will slide into recession this year, nor do Bush administration officials. But ex Fed chief Alan Greenspan has put the odds at one in three. The first-quarter's performance was the weakest since the final quarter of 2002, when the economy recovering from a recession. At that time, GDP eked out a 0.2 percent growth rate. Economists were predicting the first-quarter performance this year would be downgraded, but not as much as it did. They were calling for a 0.8 percent growth rate pace. GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced in the United States. It is considered the best measure of the country's economic fitness. In more encouraging economic news, the Labor Department reported that fewer people signed up for unemployment benefits last week. New filings dropped by 4,000 to 310,000. That suggests the employment climate is weathering well the economy's sluggish spell. Many economists believe the first quarter will be the low point for this year. They expect growth will improve but still be sluggish. The National Association for Business Economics predicts the economy will expand at a 2.3 percent pace in the April-to-June quarter. In the first quarter, there was a larger trade deficit than first thought. That ended up shaving a full percentage point from the GDP. Businesses cut back on inventory investment as they tried to make sure unsold stocks of goods didn't get out of whack with customer demand. That lopped off nearly a percentage point to first quarter GDP. Those were the biggest factors behind the government slicing its initial GDP estimate released a month ago by as much as it did. The sour housing market also restrained overall economic activity. Investment in home building was cut by 15.4 percent, on an annualized basis, However, that wasn't as deep a cut as the 17 percent annualized drop initally estimated. And, it wasn't as severe as the 19.8 percent annualized drop seen in the final quarter of last year. Even so, there is no doubt that troubled housing market is one of the biggest problems for the economy. Although some businesses tightened the belt consumers did not. That helped to prevent the economy from stalling out altogether. Consumers boosted their spending by a 4.4 percent growth rate the most in a year. Consumer spending accounts for a major chunk of economic activity. Some economists wonder how much interest consumers will have in continued brisk spending, however, given rising gasoline prices that have topped $3 a gallon in many markets. More money spent filling up the gas tank leaves less to spend on other things. One of the reasons consumers have stayed so resilient even as the housing market has been stuck in a rut for a year is because the job market has been good.

An inflation gauge tied to the GDP report and closely watched by the Fed showed that core prices - excluding food and energy - rose at a rate of 2.2 percent That was unchanged from its initial estimate but up from a 1.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been at 5.25 percent for nearly a year. Many economists predict the rate probably will stay right where it is through the rest of this year.

(AP) - Warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. said Thursday its fiscal third-quarter profit declined 4.9 percent due to a charge, but sales advanced at a double-digit pace. Income for the quarter ended May 13 slid to $224 million from $235.6 million. Per-share earnings were flat at 49 cents. The latest quarter includes a $30.3 million charge to reflect the reduced gross margin on estimated future returns recorded in the increased sales return reserve. Excluding the item, earnings per share were 56 cents, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to a Thomson Financial survey. Sales rose 10 percent to $14.34 billion from $13.01 billion but were shy of the consensus estimate of $14.68 billion. Costco booked a reserve to increase its sales returns reserve balance that trimmed sales in the most recent quarter by $228.2 million. Excluding the reserve, sales rose 12 percent to $14.57 billion. Quarterly same-store sales rose 7 percent, reflecting a 7 percent domestic increase and 10 percent international growth. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, are a key measure of retailer performance, because they measure growth at existing stores rather than from newly opened ones. Costco shares were up 66 cents to $57.23 at the open of trading Thursday.

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7814872.html New CEO takes over telecom giant AT&T CEO takes over telecom giant AT&T Jun 3, 2007 at 2:46 PM PDT Jun 3, 2007 at 2:46 PM PDT SAN ANTONIO (AP) - After an acquisition binge that transformed the smallest Baby Bell into a telecommunications heavyweight, AT&T Inc. is undergoing another change Sunday: a new chief executive. Randall Stephenson, 47, rose through the ranks of AT&T and previously served as its chief financial officer and chief operating officer. He is credited with helping position the company so it could afford the buying spree that turned it into the nation's largest provider of traditional phone, wireless and broadband services. Stephenson takes over for Edward Whitacre Jr. in time for what might be the most hyped telecommunications device launch in a generation, Apple Inc.'s iPhone. AT&T - whose wireless division was formerly known as Cingular - will be the exclusive carrier for the combination cell phone, portable music player and Web device when it launches in the U.S. later this month. ''Whatever your expectations are from this device, they are probably too low,'' Stephenson said in a recent interview. ''It changes how we think about the PDA (personal digital assistant), the iPod and the cell phone interacting.'' More than 1 million people have signed up through AT&T's Web site for a call when the iPhone becomes available, Stephenson said. It will be available in two models, priced at $499 or $599. It's not clear how many of the devices will be available at launch, but Stephenson said, ''I'll be really disappointed if there's not a shortage.'' AT&T plans to grow through wireless, using that business segment to drive sales of its traditional phone, high-speed Internet and other services. ''The company is going to be positioned as a wireless-centered company,'' Stephenson said. ''Once you have mom and dad and the kids on wireless, then you get them on broadband and television.'' He said he doesn't plan major departures from the path San Antonio-based AT&T is following, after takeovers of BellSouth Corp., the Cingular Wireless business and the AT&T long-distance business. The BellSouth acquisition gave it full control of Cingular. Most of the major consolidation in the telecommunications business is done, he said. ''No hard left or right turns. We've set the direction of this business over the last two to three years,'' he said. AT&T's stock has been trading at five-year highs, but despite the excitement around the iPhone, Stephenson still faces significant challenges. He'll have to finish the integration of BellSouth, an $86 billion purchase, and the AT&T long-distance business, bought for $16 billion in 2005, while trying to grow revenue in a wireless business that's facing heavy competition. More competition will continue to come from cable, which is selling phone service along with TV and Internet. AT&T has responded with its U-verse television service, though the rollout has been slow and it won't be available in any of the old BellSouth territory until later this year. Analysts say the rapid, wide-scale changes in the telecommunications business give Stephenson the reins of a company vastly different from the one run by Whitacre. ''It's not the same marketplace,'' said industry analyst Jeff Kagan, noting the 1984 breakup of the old AT&T Corp. - Ma Bell - was followed by an avalanche of new competitors and then consolidation. ''He's inheriting a company that is a brilliantly put together company, and it's very profitable. But they're going into head-to-head competition with new companies that are also very profitable and very strong.'' Kent Custer, an analyst for A.G. Edwards & Sons, said Stephenson, who began at Southwestern Bell in 1982, eventually rising to chief financial officer in 2001, has long been an influential force at AT&T. He became the chief operating officer of the company, then called SBC Communications, in 2004. Since that time, the company has better positioned itself for growth, Custer said. Traditional phone service remains under attack from wireless carriers and cable competition, but ''generally, the business is in better standing than it was two or three years ago,'' he said. Stephenson will have big shoes to fill. Whitacre, an executive who pushed change and managed deals others thought wouldn't get done, was an enormous force in the telecommunications business during his 17 years at the helm of AT&T. ''I've learned a lot from him,'' Stephenson said. ''If you want to move the needle in this business, you have to think big.'' Whitacre, a famously blunt Texan, offered Stephenson one piece of advice after the executive change was announced.

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7824657.html Orders to factories post weakest advance in 3 months to factories post weakest advance in 3 months Jun 4, 2007 at 9:00 AM PDT Jun 4, 2007 at 9:00 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - Orders to U.S. factories posted a weaker-than-expected gain in April as declines in demand for cars, planes and boats offset strength in business investment. The Commerce Department reported Monday that factory orders increased by 0.3 percent in April, the weakest showing in three months. It was less than half of the 0.8 percent increase that analysts had been expecting. Still, economists were encouraged that orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft - a category considered a good proxy for business investment - was up a strong 2.1 percent in April following an even larger 4.6 percent rise in March. The lower-than-expected overall reading reflected a 1.6 percent drop in orders for transportation equipment, an extremely volatile category that had soared by 13.6 percent the previous month. Orders for motor vehicles and parts fell by 3.3 percent, reflecting continuing problems that domestic automakers are having with sagging demand in the face of soaring gasoline prices. Orders for commercial aircraft plunged by 10.7 percent after having posted huge gains in the past two months. Demand for ships and boats was down 23.4 percent, a reversal after a large 13.3 percent increase the previous month. The 0.3 percent increase in orders followed a big 4.1 percent jump in March that had been powered by the strength in commercial airplane orders. Even with the slower April showing, analysts believe that manufacturing is beginning to revive after a slowdown that reflected the weakness in the overall economy. The gross domestic product, a measure of the economy's total output, rose at a barely discernible 0.6 percent in the first three months of the year, reflecting continuing troubles in the nation's housing industry. However, many economists believe that figure will represent the low point for the slowdown. They are expecting gradually stronger numbers as the year progresses, although they caution that this outlook could prove too optimistic if the housing slump deepens further. Orders for durable goods, items expected to last three or more years, rose by 0.8 percent, slightly better than the 0.6 percent increase initially reported. One of the biggest declines for durable goods was a 31.5 percent plunge in construction machinery, reflecting continued troubles in home-building, where contractors are slashing building plans in the face of slumping demand. Orders for non-durable goods edged down 0.2 percent in April as oil refineries continue to struggle with unexpected shutdowns. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder

The law requires insurance companies and other businesses to notify customers who are charged more because of their credit ratings. In a unanimous decision, the justices said Geico General Insurance Co. did not violate the law and that Seattle-based Safeco might have, but did not do so recklessly. The insurance industry said a decision against it could have subjected companies to billions of dollars in punitive damages for failing to notify customers. Thirteen state insurance commissioners said that a lower threshhold for proving liability would motivate compliance with the law. To find liability, a company's conduct must be more than "merely careless," wrote Justice David Souter. Souter said that a company's conduct must entail an unjustifiably high risk of harm that is either known to a company or is so obvious that it should have been known.

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7824632.html India delays WTO probe of its tariffs on American wine, spirits delays WTO probe of its tariffs on American wine, spirits Jun 4, 2007 at 8:59 AM PDT Jun 4, 2007 at 8:59 AM PDT GENEVA (AP) - India blocked a World Trade Organization investigation of import duties on American wine and spirits Monday, delaying a U.S. complaint alleging that the country discriminates against products like wines from Napa Valley and Jack Daniel's whiskey. India is one of the largest markets for alcohol in the world and has huge potential for growth. The Geneva-based trade referee is already reviewing a European legal challenge of wine and liquor restrictions in a number of Indian states. A second investigative panel examining Washington's complaint will almost certainly be established later this month. Under WTO rules, a second request for a formal investigation is automatically approved. A case can result in punitive sanctions, but panels take months, and sometimes years, to reach a decision. "The layers of customs duties India applies to U.S. products, in particular to wine and distilled spirits, are not in line with its WTO commitments," U.S. Trade Representative Susan Schwab said last month. "We must ensure a level playing field for U.S. products around the world." India's basic import duties on wine are 100 percent, while the tariff on spirits is 150 percent, both within WTO limits. However, government surcharges take the tariffs up to levels reaching as high as 550 percent. The United States, the European Union and Japan, by contrast, allow nearly all spirits to enter their markets duty-free. China tacks a 10 percent charge to foreign liquor. India on Monday criticized Washington's decision to bring the case to the WTO as "unfortunate and disappointing." India said it is reviewing its own trade rules to resolve the dispute, a claim it also made in criticizing Brussels' decision to bring the case to the WTO. The U.S. said wine sales in India through special duty-free rules, such as at airports and luxury hotels, grew by 350 percent between 2000 and 2005. The growth was 200 percent for American liquors. But high import duties imposed on the vast majority of American wines and spirits means total exports remain low, the U.S. says. The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States estimates that all foreign liquors together account for less than 1 percent of the Indian market. The 27-nation EU, in making its complaint, said India bought $31.3 million worth of European spirits in 2004 - from French cognac to Finnish vodka - and $5.4 million worth of Bordeaux, Chianti, Rioja and other European wines. That compares with global European spirits exports amounting to $6.7 billion and wine exports of $6.1 billion each year. It is unclear if the U.S. and the EU will combine their cases against India before the WTO. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7814182.html 'Piggybacking' roils credit industry roils credit industry Jun 3, 2007 at 12:02 PM PDT Jun 3, 2007 at 12:02 PM PDT Only a low credit score stood between Alipio Estruch and a mortgage to buy a $449,000 Spanish-style house in Weston, Fla., a few miles west of Fort Lauderdale. Instead of spending several years repairing his credit rating, which he said was marred by two forgotten cell phone bills and identity theft, the 37-year-old real estate agent paid $1,800 to an Internet-based company to bump up his score almost overnight. The result was a happy ending for Estruch, but the growing practice is sending shivers through the mortgage industry. Federal regulators are also reviewing the practice. And after being contacted by The Associated Press for this story, Fair Isaac Corp., the developer of the widely used FICO score, said it will change its credit scoring system beginning later this year in a way it contends will end this little-known but potentially high-impact mortgage loan loophole. Instantcreditbuilders.com, or ICB, helped Estruch boost his score by arranging for him to be added as an authorized user on several credit cards of people with stellar credit who were paid to allow this coattailing. Parents also use this practice when they add their children to their credit cards to help them build solid credit. The pitch to those who are essentially renting their credit history for pay is seductive: You don't need to worry about users of this service receiving duplicate copies of your credit cards, account numbers or any of your personal information. It's essentially free money, they are told. Brian Kinney, 44, a retired Army officer in Glendale, Calif., pulls in more than $2,500 a month by lending out 19 credit card spots on two old Citibank cards with strong payment histories. Kinney, whose FICO score is above 800 on the scale of 300 to 850, quit his job working at a Farmers Insurance agency and uses the ICB income to tide him over until he starts his own insurance agency. Lenders are worried, however, that they're taking on greater default risks by unknowingly offering lower interest rates than they otherwise would to applicants who artificially boost their credit scores. Their trade group has complained to the Federal Trade Commission and is talking with the credit reporting bureaus in case the practice becomes more widespread. Estruch paid $1,800 in December for three credit card spots, and by January, his FICO score jumped from 550 to 715. In mid-March, he closed on his four-bedroom beige stucco house after obtaining a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage from a unit of American Home Mortgage Investment Corp. It carried a 7.5 percent interest rate and required no down payment. ''Everything now is score driven. I had a great mortgage history, but I got hurt because of my credit score,'' said Estruch, who also works as a mortgage broker, had bought and sold two houses previously, and currently owns another home in New York. Estruch said he's current on his mortgage payments. Companies like Largo, Fla.-based ICB are sprouting on the Internet with little overhead and no-frills marketing. They post ads on community Web sites like Craigslist and have sponsored links on Google and Yahoo. Competitors of ICB have even reached out to mortgage brokers, lenders and real estate agents, flooding their e-mail with advertisements. Jason LaBossiere, who founded ICB a year and a half ago, said his company receives 100 to 150 new leads daily - a number that has been growing - and those inquiries lead to 10 to 20 new clients a week. ICB charges $900 for the first credit card account, with a discount for additional ones. The cardholder allowing the piggybacking on his or her credit history can receive $100 to $150 per slot, depending on the age and credit limit of each card. ICB pockets the rest. The effect on a credit score can vary depending on what else is in a client's report. But one borrowed credit card account can increase a score between 30 and 45 points, two between 60 and 90 points, and five between 150 and 205 points, according to ICB. That's because the computer program that calculates scores is essentially tricked into believing the credit renter has a better repayment history when it sees the added accounts, and that helps lift the credit score. Once the credit card company files an updated report to credit bureaus - leading to a higher FICO score - the credit renter is removed from the account of the person allowing the piggybacking. However, the credit card's payment history remains on the authorized user's credit report forever, and lenders have no way of knowing how the credit borrower is related to the cardholder. A higher credit score can save a consumer an enormous amount of money because it usually means a lower mortgage interest rate. It also can mean the difference between qualifying for a loan or not, as in Estruch's case. According to Fair Isaac, lenders would probably demand about a 9.8 percent interest rate on a $300,000, 30-year fixed mortgage for an applicant with a credit score between 500 and 579. That would translate into a $2,585 monthly payment for principal and interest. But a borrower with a score between 760 and 850 seeking the same loan would qualify for about a 6 percent rate that would cost just $1,796 a month for principal and interest. That savings of $789 each month would total $284,040 over 30 years. Kinney, the retired Army officer in California, said those borrowing his good credit history don't get his personal information, full credit card number or credit card expiration dates. Any sensitive data is handled through ICB, and Kinney adds the users himself by calling his credit card company. ICB also destroys any duplicate cards that are issued to the credit renter, according to its contract. Instead of being worried about risks he may be assuming, Kinney said borrowers are the ones vulnerable to scammers posing as do-gooders. Those seeking a credit hike give the cardholder their names and Social Security numbers, which, in the wrong hands, could lead to identity theft. Kinney said he also receives credit card offers in the mail for the credit borrowers on his accounts, opening up another possibility for fraud, but he throws them away. ''I know the whole thing sounds kind of odd and not very legitimate, but it is for now,'' Kinney said. ''I don't know how long before someone will decide it's illegal. But I'm not counting on this for the long-term.'' Ginny Ferguson, a mortgage broker in Pleasanton, Calif., and a credit expert for the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, considers the practice mortgage fraud, and the trade organization is about to release a policy statement against it. ''These companies are encouraging consumers to commit fraud. On a standard home loan, there's a clause that says the consumer is not omitting pertinent facts that could impact his or her ability to repay the loan,'' Ferguson said. ICB's LaBossiere said he sees his business as a second chance for the consumer who has had little financial education to make good decisions. ''People who are our clients are spending an incredible amount of money to get their finances back in order,'' he said. ''They've learned through a school of pain that it's such an important aspect of regaining control of their lives again.'' So far, federal authorities have yet to make a ruling on the practice. ''What I've gathered from attorneys here is that it appears to be legal'' technically, said FTC spokesman Frank Dorman. ''However, the agency is not saying that it is legal.'' Lenders, who depend on credit scores to assess a person's ability to pay back a loan, are closely watching the practice's growth. It also comes at a time when the industry is reeling from the a soaring default rate on subprime mortgages, home loans for people with bad credit. As a result, they've tightened lending standards, but the credit-renting practice threatens to undermine their efforts to reduce exposure to risky borrowers. Ninety percent of the largest U.S. banks base their loan decisions on FICO scores, which currently includes authorized user accounts. However, after discussions with lenders and industry officials, Fair Isaac said it intends to announce this week that all future versions of its FICO score methodology will no longer consider authorized user accounts, said Tom Quinn, Fair Isaac's vice president of scoring solutions. The next version is slated to roll out in September to one of the three main credit reporting agencies - Equifax Inc., Experian Information Solutions Inc. or TransUnion LLC - with the other two agencies receiving the new version some time in 2008. The change won't be a quick-fix for lenders trying to weed out credit renters. Corey Carlisle, senior director of government affairs for the Mortgage Bankers Association, said it takes time for lenders to transition from one scoring system to another. ''All lenders have their own guidelines and parameters on how to use and incorporate the FICO score. It would take time to understand what's in a new credit score,'' Carlisle said. Quinn also noted that some lenders generate their own scores using authorized user accounts in their calculations, so the practice may not be easily negated. ''It's an industrywide issue and there are other scores out there,'' he said. This is a phenomenon that impacts more than just FICO scores.'' Other consumers besides credit renters stand to lose with the change, namely those for whom authorized user accounts were designed: college students on their parents' cards and spouses with little to no credit of their own. But there's no way to distinguish these from the latest crop of strangers trying to augment their scores. Lenders who want to find out more information about others on credit card accounts are hindered by the Fair Credit Reporting Act and privacy laws. ''As with any decision, there's a trade-off,'' Quinn said. ''The many honest consumers who learn good credit skills with the help from a family member, that feature will be removed. But the challenge for us is maintaining the integrity of the FICO score.'' arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder

(AP) - Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. said Monday its first-quarter loss for fiscal year 2008 widened as the doughnut maker continued its recovery from a bad stumble several years ago. For the quarter ending April 29, the doughnut maker said its net loss was $7.4 million, or 12 cents per share, compared with a net loss of $6 million, or 10 cents per share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $110.9 million, down from $119.4 million a year earlier. The results include a $9.6 million charge related to a prepayment fee and the write-off of deferred financing costs. The company also received a $14.9 million credit due to the decrease in the fair value of securities it issued in connection with the settlement of litigation. Wall Street expected earnings of 5 cents per share on $115.7 million of sales, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial. "While Krispy Kreme still faces some longstanding challenges, we continue to advance the turnaround," said Chief Executive Daryl Brewster in a statement. Krispy Kreme executives were expected to speak with shareholders Monday during the company's annual meeting in Winston-Salem. Krispy Kreme stumbled badly three years ago as it placed its famed doughnuts on grocery store shelves and expanded rapidly. While sales slipped, Krispy Kreme executives were forced to sort out an accounting mess. A stock that once traded at more than $50 bottomed out last year at about $4, and the company's board ousted two former executives it said were trying to "manage earnings" to meet Wall Street expectations. Krispy Kreme has since worked to bring its financials up to date with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company filed its last overdue financial statement in January. Krispy Kreme shares fell 22 cents to $8.45 at the open of trading Monday. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7806547.html Report: SEC is supporting Enron shareholders in high court case SEC is supporting Enron shareholders in high court case Jun 2, 2007 at 3:14 PM PDT Jun 2, 2007 at 3:14 PM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - The Securities and Exchange Commission has decided to support shareholders suing Wall Street banks for damages over Enron's collapse in a significant case before the Supreme Court, according to a newspaper report Saturday. The Enron shareholders' $40 billion lawsuit contends that Merrill Lynch & Co., Barclays PLC and Credit Suisse Group should be held equally liable as Enron Corp. as participants in the energy company's massive accounting fraud. Thirty states took the shareholders' side, and the SEC's widely awaited position has been viewed by some observers as a key test of the agency's leanings on questions of investor protection under Chairman Christopher Cox. The SEC has asked the Justice Department's solicitor general, who represents the government's view in Supreme Court cases, to file a court brief in support of the Enron shareholders' position, The Washington Post said, citing unnamed people familiar with the SEC's decision. SEC spokesman John Nester declined to comment Saturday. In recent weeks, unions, state regulators and plaintiffs' attorneys have been pressing the SEC to intervene in the case on the side of the Enron shareholders. The shareholders appealed to the Supreme Court after a federal appeals court in New Orleans ruled in March that they cannot proceed with their class-action lawsuit. The high court is expected to hear arguments in the case in its next term that begins in October. Dan Newman, a spokesman for Enron plaintiffs' law firm Lerach Coughlin, said Saturday the firm had not been informed of the SEC's intention to support the shareholders' position. "But if it's true that the SEC has affirmed their long-standing opinion that all fraudsters can be held accountable, it's a positive step for investors, taxpayers, financial markets and victims of corporate misconduct," Newman said. Enron, once the nation's seventh-largest company, filed bankruptcy in December 2001 when accounting tricks could no longer hide billions of dollars in debt. The collapse wiped out thousands of jobs, more than $60 billion in market value and more than $2 billion in pension plans. The attorneys representing the shareholders argue that the Wall Street investment banks played key roles in Enron's "scheme to defraud." Under a 1995 law, a single defendant can be held liable for paying the entire amount of damages if the judge determines that the defendant knowingly violated the securities laws. The SEC's position in the case appears to be in line with its legal arguments in recent years in lower courts. The agency has said that an investment bank may be deemed a "lead violator" if it intentionally engaged in a deceptive act in a scheme to defraud shareholders. The idea expounded by the SEC was that sort of deception can be made by acts as well as words. Still, a number of union leaders, investor advocates and politicians voiced concern in recent months that the SEC could refrain from taking a stance in the case or side with the investment bank defendants. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7827277.html Airbus rival to Boeing 787 to enter service in 2013 rival to Boeing 787 to enter service in 2013 Jun 4, 2007 at 11:36 AM PDT Jun 4, 2007 at 11:36 AM PDT TOULOUSE, France (AP) - Airbus, the ailing European planemaker, will be producing its delayed A350 XWB plane at a rate of 13 per month by 2016, making it the fastest made wide-bodied plane at Airbus, Chief Engineer Gordon McConnell said Monday. The revamped plane enters into service in 2013 - five years after U.S. rival Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, expected to be a top competitor along with the 777. Delivery would be at 13 per month in 2017. Airbus has been losing customers for mid-sized planes to Boeing and was forced last year to launch a costly redesign of the planned A350. Boeing has not disclosed monthly production rates it is projecting for the 787, but has said it would deliver 112 planes for the first two years. Alan Pardoe, Airbus director of product marketing, said that despite the delay, Airbus hoped to grab a "good 50 percent" of the market for wide-bodied planes up to 400 seats, and estimated that would amount to 5,300 planes over 20 years. The two officials spoke with a small group of reporters. Airbus claims its A350 XWD, made from carbon fiber wings and composites, will be lighter per seat and more economical than existing aircraft. McConnell, the chief engineer, strongly denied media reports that carriers including Qatar Airways, Singapore Airlines Ltd., Emirates and the International Lease Finance Corp. were pressing Airbus for changes to the A350's fuselage design. Airbus' decision to use four long panels "allows us to optimize our design of the fuselage," he said. "It gives us a better trade-off of weight versus cost." Airbus got a much-needed boost last week from Qatar Airways, which ordered an extra 20 A350 XWD. The European planemaker has 155 pledges on its books for the new model, of which 13 are firm commitments. Including orders for the old model, which Airbus is having to renegotiate with customers, there are 268 pledges. That's still far behind the 584 orders Boeing has for its equivalent 787 Dreamliner, due to enter commercial service next May. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7806097.html Bid for Journal is talk of Wall Street for Journal is talk of Wall Street Jun 2, 2007 at 1:16 PM PDT Jun 2, 2007 at 1:16 PM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - Financial analyst Edouard Morin slid from his lunch seat at the swanky Harry's Cafe around the corner from Wall Street and sized up the latest merger talk that has the business world abuzz. ''The Journal is an American icon,'' he said. But this is Wall Street after all, so he added an important caveat: ''Everything is for sale these days, at the right price.'' Some on Wall Street said Rupert Murdoch's attempt to buy The Wall Street Journal was a bad idea, while others said it was merely capitalism - you have to do what's best for the business. The Bancroft family, which controls Dow Jones & Co., says it is warming to the idea of selling the company, with Murdoch being the most visible suitor. His media conglomerate, News Corp., includes the New York Post, Fox News, and MySpace. The Journal, founded in 1889, has a daily circulation of about 2 million, and is one of the world's most venerable papers. A cheeky list of who-reads-what that has made the rounds on the Internet says that The Wall Street Journal is read by the people who run the country. And that the Post is read by people who don't care who's running the country - as long as they do something really scandalous, preferably while intoxicated. But Murdoch has promised that if his company buys the Journal, he would ensure its editorial independence. One young man looking to enter the stock market said he doesn't want Murdoch to transfer his brand of tabloid journalism to the Journal. ''I get all my financial news from the Wall Street Journal,'' said Rhudy Correa, 21, as he sat on the steps of the historic Federal Hall overlooking the New York Stock Exchange - a quick lunch-hour perch of choice for many Wall Street employees. A college student working as a summer intern with Oppenheimer Funds, Correa said he wants the Journal to stay as it is. ''I wouldn't advise making changes in it - that would be kind of touchy.'' His friend, Christian Goodspeed, balanced a takeout container of Chinese food in one hand as he dug into it with a fork - offering his opinion of the Murdoch bid between bites. ''I go to the Wall Street Journal if I need investment news,'' said Goodspeed, 20, an intern at another Wall Street firm, Stoever Glass & Co. ''It's a cornerstone, and it can't change. I wouldn't like that.'' Even if Murdoch controlled the Journal, Goodspeed predicted there wouldn't be major changes. But at least one person on Wall Street believes the Post has something to teach the stalwart Journal. ''If Murdoch can do for the Journal what he's done for the Post, he'd be doing a great thing,'' said Bob Dolin, who has worked for 27 years in his family newspaper stand on Wall Street, a few steps from the exchange. ''The Post has a very good variety of writers, plus sports and interesting articles. The whole format makes it very desirable,'' said Dolin, standing behind a display of Friday's Post, its front page touting a woman allegedly seen with Yankees star Alex Rodriguez - not his wife. Dolin doesn't sell the Journal any more. The truck driver who delivers it refuses to walk the papers from the Wall Street corner where his truck stops to Dolin's stand. Every day, the vendor sells about 60 copies of the Post - mostly to Wall Street employees.

http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7824572.html Flextronics buys Solectron for $3.6 billion in cash and stock buys Solectron for $3.6 billion in cash and stock Jun 4, 2007 at 8:56 AM PDT Jun 4, 2007 at 8:56 AM PDT MILPITAS, Calif. (AP) - Singapore's Flextronics International Ltd. will buy rival contract electronics maker Solectron Corp. for about $3.6 billion in cash and stock. Solectron shares climbed more than 14 percent in morning trading. Under the deal announced Monday, Solectron will become a subsidiary of Flextronics, with Solectron shareholders holding a stake of between 20 percent to 26 percent. Solectron will nominate two people to the board of the combined company, subject to approval by Flextronics. Flextronics Chief Executive Mike McNamara said the deal will give Flextronics increased scale to extend its market reach and save on costs. Flextronics, whose customers include Casio Computer Co., Dell Computer Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., Ericsson Telecom AB, Hewlett-Packard Co., Microsoft Corp., Motorola Inc., Nortel Networks Ltd., Sony-Ericsson and Xerox Corp., expects the deal to add at least 15 percent to its earnings. Solectron, based in Milpitas, Calif., operates in more than 20 countries and had sales from continuing operations of $10.6 billion in fiscal 2006. Its customers include Cisco Systems Inc., International Business Machines and Sun Microsystems Inc. as well as Ericsson, Motorola, Nortel Networks and Hewlett-Packard. The buyout is expected to close by the end of the year with the approval of shareholders and regulators. Solectron shareholders will be able to convert each of their shares into either 0.3450 shares of Flextronics shares or $3.89 per share in cash. The agreement allows only 50 percent to 70 percent of Solectron shares to be converted to Flextronics shares. The cash being offered represents a premium of about 15 percent over Solectron's closing price of $3.37 on Friday, while the stock portion represents a 20 percent premium based on Flextronics' closing price on Friday. Solectron shares rose 49 cents, or 14.5 percent, to $3.86 in morning trading, while Flextronics shares fell 25 cents to $11.45. Citigroup Global Markets Inc. has committed a $2.5 billion seven-year senior unsecured term loan to fund the deal, according to Flextronics, including the refinancing of Solectron's debt if needed. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
