Republican lawmakers rushed to Gonzales' defense as the attorney general denied anew that the firings last year were improper. The mostly muted five-hour hearing in front of the House Judiciary Committee was a sharp contrast to Gonzales' sometimes testy appearance three weeks ago when Senate Republicans questioned his competence to run the Justice Department. One senator at that session joined a small GOP chorus saying he should step down. "I will work as hard as I can, working with this committee and working with DOJ employees, to reassure the American people that this department is focused on doing its job," Gonzales said Thursday. That did not satisfy exasperated Democrats, who accused Gonzales of being evasive. "Your reputation is on the line, Mr. Attorney General. What do you have to say for yourself?" asked Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., adding that the "buck stops at the top." "I accept responsibility," Gonzales answered. President Bush steadfastly has stood by Gonzales, his longtime counselor and friend. Even career Justice Department staffers angered by the attorney general's response to the firings acknowledge Gonzales appears to have beaten back calls to leave. The latest lawmaker to urge Gonzales to quit was Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. "I hope you will resign because the department is broken and I don't think you're the one to fix it," Schiff told him. Republicans sought to portray the controversy as losing steam. They pushed Democrats to wrap up the congressional probe that has dogged the department since the beginning of the year. "The list of accusations has mushroomed, but the evidence of wrongdoing has not," said Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, top Republican on the committee. "If there are no fish in this lake, we should reel in our lines of questions, dock our empty boat and turn to more pressing issues." Gonzales acknowledged low morale at the department. Career prosecutors have said it is stunting hiring. Private defense lawyers say it has led to government hesitation and indecisiveness in some courtrooms. Gonzales contended the department's independence is intact. "Contrary to being gun shy, this process is somewhat liberating in terms of going forward," he said. Gonzales repeatedly said he was unaware of many of the factors leading up to the dismissals because he relied on his former chief of staff, Kyle Sampson, to carry them out. He also said he could not clarify parts of the firing process that remain murky in his own mind while investigations of the dismissals continue. He said he has "no basis to believe" that Todd Graves, the former prosecutor in Kansas City, Mo., left in early 2006 because Graves refused to endorse department allegations about voter fraud in Missouri. Gonzales praised the work of Debra Yang, formerly the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, who resigned in October to take a higher paying job at a private firm. Graves and Yang were not among the eight prosecutors whose dismissals are being investigated. But questions about their resignations have recently surfaced. Gonzales denied that Bush's political adviser, Karl Rove, demanded last fall's ouster of then-New Mexico prosecutor David Iglesias. But the attorney general acknowledged that Rove had complained about stagnant voter fraud cases in three districts, including New Mexico, and noted those concerns were echoed by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. Those complaints spurred suspicions that Iglesias was improperly fired because he refused to target Democrats. On the other side, GOP Rep. James Sensenbrenner leaned on Gonzales on Thursday to speed the department's corruption investigation of Democratic Rep. William Jefferson of Louisiana. "Congressman, you know I cannot talk about that," Gonzales told Sensenbrenner, R-Wis. "Well, everybody's talking about it except you," Sensenbrenner answered. "The people's confidence in your department has been further eroded, separate and apart from the U.S. attorney controversy, because of the delay in dealing with this matter." The House committee also released a portion of closed-door testimony from Sampson suggesting that the Justice Department spared U.S. Attorney Steven M. Biskupic in Milwaukee to avoid angering Sensenbrenner. Thursday's hearing served up more political bickering but few new facts about the firings. At one point, as many as nine Capitol Police officers escorted a half-dozen protesters from the room out of concern they would disrupt the hearing. Despite Committee Chairman John Conyers' plea that the hearing focus on the fired prosecutors, Republicans asked Gonzales about a range of topics, including terrorism and intellectual property theft. Gonzales mostly stuck to a script of accepting responsibility and pushing beyond the controversy - to Democrats' obvious skepticism. "You have a situation where most people believe that you didn't tell the truth about the U.S. attorneys," said Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y. "If most people believe that the United States attorney general has not told the truth about why these U.S. attorneys were fired, how can they have confidence in your job?" "I don't believe that's an accurate statement," Gonzales responded. "And what I'm trying to do in appearances like this is to set the record straight." &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

The lobbying push targeted Republicans and Democrats alike, but focused primarily on those considered influential on the war debate. On Thursday, hours before the House voted to limit funds for the war, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Barham Saleh met with more than 30 House Republicans and more than a half-dozen senators, including Sens. Harry Reid, D-Nev., John Warner, R-Va., and Hillary Rodham Clinton, D-N.Y. "He understands that American patience is waning," said Sen. Norm Coleman, after eating lunch with Saleh, Iraqi Ambassador Samir Shakir al-Sumaidaie and Sen. Saxby Chambliss. But the lobbying by the Iraqis isn't the only pressure-point being applied in Washington. Clinton said Friday she considered it "promising" that several Republican House members went to the White House and told President Bush they believe the continuing war is adversely affecting the party. She said the GOP lawmakers told Bush pointblank that "he has to change course in Iraq." But she also said she didn't think that Bush was ready to reverse course. "I think we're going to go back and forth on this for a while longer," Clinton said in an interview Friday on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program with Joe Scarborough. "It is clear that whatever the mission used to be, it is either accomplished or over," she said. "If there are remaining American interests, then let's spell them out." Baghdad's ability to sell members like Coleman, R-Minn., and Chambliss, R-Ga., on the war effort is critical if the Iraqi government wants U.S. troops to stay. Coleman in recent months has become deeply skeptical of the president's decision to send additional troops to Iraq and says patience on the war in general is limited. Coleman, Chambliss and Sen. John Sununu, R-N.H., who met separately with Saleh, will be up for re-election next year - facing voters who have grown tired of a war in its fifth year and that has killed more than 3,380 troops. While Republicans have been reluctant to intervene, many say President Bush has until September to tell if the troop buildup in Iraq is working before they demand another approach. With the clock ticking, Saleh - a Kurdish politician highly regarded by U.S. officials and who speaks impeccable English - said he came to Capitol Hill to convey the "imperative of success" in Iraq. "Iraq is a central battleground in this historic conflict" against terrorism, he said in a brief interview after meeting with Reid, the Senate majority leader. His trip came on the heels of a visit by Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser to Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, along with three other senior advisers, according to the Iraqi embassy. The New York Times first reported al-Rubaie's visit on Tuesday. The timing of these meetings is no mistake. This month, Congress is expected to send Bush legislation that funds the war in Iraq but requires the Baghdad government meet certain political and security reforms. In question is what consequences the Iraqis should face if they fail. Democrats want U.S. troops to leave, Republicans say they don't want to force redeployments, but some say they would be open to withholding more than $5 billion in foreign aid. The House voted 221-205 Thursday for a stronger measure that would fund the war only through July, giving Congress the option of cutting off money after that. The bill is unlikely to survive in the Senate, although it indicates the war's unpopularity among members and their frustration with the lack of progress in the Iraqi parliament. The most recent irritant among U.S. lawmakers was a report that Iraqi officials would break for two months this summer. "Our armed forces are up to 150,000 troops; we're over $600 billion appropriated for this, lost 3,300 lives, 25,000 wounded fellow citizens. ... And the Iraqi answer? We're taking a summer off. Goin' fishing," said Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill. Saleh said he expects the vacation to be shortened by at least a month, although nothing had been decided. He added that Iraqis value being independent and do "not take kindly of (U.S. officials) telling us when to recess." Democrats seemed to consider these meetings with Iraqi officials as beneficial - if only to convey their frustration to Iraqi officials in person. Reid's spokesman Jim Manley said the senator told Saleh that "U.S. patience, blood and treasure were not unlimited and that the Congress would be taking a more decisive role in the coming weeks and months." "Salih understood the point, and said he would deliver the message to the Iraqi cabinet," Manley added. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Global Warming? Gay Marriage? See Where the Candidates Stand COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday refused to stop a Republican presidential debate scheduled for next week, turning down a bid by a long-shot candidate who wanted to share the stage with front-runners in the 2008 race. John Cox, a Chicago businessman, had filed a lawsuit accusing the debate's organizers of rigging the criteria they used to decide who could take the stage for the May 15 debate in Columbia. Fox News Channel and the South Carolina Republican Party had said that candidates who earned 1 percent of support in state and national polls would be invited; 10 candidates are expected to attend. Cox claimed he was unfairly excluded because the two organizations arbitrarily chose a poll that did not mention his name when respondents were asked about different candidates. He had asked to be included in Tuesday's debate, or for the debate to be halted. U.S. District Judge Joe Anderson ruled the state party has a right to choose who is going to be in the debate. He said that while state law gives the party the authority to conduct its own primary, that does not require the GOP to function as though it is a government entity in its sponsorship of the debate. "It's not the primary. That's the point," GOP lawyer Larry Richter said after the ruling. Cox lawyer Chris Oakes said he was disappointed with the decision but happy with the Anderson's quick action. "We believe he gave us a fair opportunity to be heard," Oakes said. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

The move postponed - at least for a day - what was shaping up as a partisan clash over immigration after weeks of negotiations between the White House and senators in both parties designed to strike a broad compromise. With that agreement still elusive, Reid is planning to force debate next week on an immigration measure that passed the Senate last year with wide Democratic backing but opposition by a majority of Republicans. GOP senators have promised to block that move, saying they will only accept a new bipartisan compromise. "Some of the senators feel that there's a breakthrough that could take place" in talks over the weekend and early next week, said Reid, D-Nev., adding that he would "reluctantly" postpone the test-vote, which he had set for Tuesday. He has now set the vote for next Wednesday. Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the move would "give us the maximum opportunity to piece back together the bipartisan agreement that we thought we almost had a week or so ago." Talks are continuing on the possible deal, which would first secure the U.S.-Mexico border and implement an elaborate high-tech identification system for immigrant workers, and only then give millions of illegal immigrants a chance at legal status - after waits as long as 13 more years. Many Democrats and Republicans are wary of such an agreement, which also would limit immigrants' ability to bring their families to the U.S. Democrats fear it will be rejected as too punitive by their liberal base, while Republicans are concerned about alienating conservatives by appearing to treat illegal immigrants too leniently. President Bush plans to use his Saturday weekly radio address to urge Congress to reshape immigration laws. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The former New York City mayor has struggled in the last week to explain his personal opposition to terminating pregnancies with his long record of favoring a woman's right to choose. He has defended his positions - and some say contradictory comments - on late-term abortion, public funding for abortions and the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. "Everybody's got to make a choice," Giuliani told about 500 students, faculty and staff crammed into an auditorium at Houston Baptist University. "How important are the differences and how important are the other issues we may agree on." Giuliani emphasized his conservative credentials on tax cuts, crime and the war in Iraq before clarifying his support for abortion rights, a position he acknowledged was unlikely to be shared by those listening. Describing his belief that abortion was "morally wrong," Giuliani said he has opposed it all his life. But he said he believes the decision should ultimately be left to individuals and that their decisions should be respected. "In a country like ours ... I believe you have to respect their viewpoint and give them a level of choice. I would grant women the right to make that choice," he said. Several students praised Giuliani's speech, but said it was unlikely to make them support his candidacy. "Overall, I thought it was a great speech," said Erik Mignault, a 25-year-old political science major. "I think it was a good political stance to take. He's sitting right in the middle." But Mignault and several other students said they were strictly anti-abortion and likely to support a more conservative candidate. Giuliani's appearance was greeted warmly, and he appeared playful at times, hoisting a child with an "I Love New York" T-shirt and laughing at boos when he spoke of his love for the New York Yankees, the team that this week acquired Houston Astros star pitcher Roger Clemens. But Giuliani told the audience at the small Christian school that they should support a candidate who could protect America from terrorism and from Democratic assaults on the economy. He acknowledged that abortion was the issue that most divided them. "I have profound respect for your views," he said. "I have profound respect for your education, and I have profound respect for your religion." But, he said, it is uniquely American to disagree on some political issues while agreeing on many others. "We understand how to respect each other's differences," he said. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/D/DEMOCRATS_LABOR?SITE=TNKNN&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	KnoxNews: News from the Associated Press View all of the AP's breaking news stories Email this page to a friend May 11, 12:41 PM EDT Democratic candidates woo firefighters Buy AP Photo Reprints PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopefuls told unionized firefighters Friday that they would stand behind them and provide the resources they deserve - and that Republicans would not. "They'll praise your work in speeches, they'll honor you as heroes in words, but when it comes to deeds, they make it harder for you to do your job," Sen. Barack Obama said, speaking by phone to the International Association of Fire Fighters leadership convention. "Instead of making your job easier, they create other kinds of fires you have to put out." The Illinois senator was the second of six 2008 Democratic hopefuls to address the powerful union's leaders during a two-day meeting in the state with the earliest primary. Obama said he wanted to attend, but was in Iowa, another early voting state. Later Friday, Connecticut Sen. Chris Dodd told the firefighters in person that increased union membership would narrow the wage gap and be a boon for the middle class. "The middle class in this country didn't occur miraculously," Dodd said. "I happen to believe the disparity in income in our country has been created by the decline in union households." Delaware Sen. Joe Biden used his turn at the podium to repeat his personal appreciation for firefighters. "It was the well-trained firefighter with the Jaws of Life ... who were able to save my two sons," Biden said, referring to an automobile accident that killed his wife and daughter. He warned that President Bush has "waged a war on labor." "With you guys out of the way, the barbarians can go through the gates, man," Biden said. Later Friday, union leaders were slated to hear in person from New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton and former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards. On Thursday, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson told the group that, unlike some other contenders, he has a strong record of supporting unions. "There are a lot of candidates who will come up and take a picture with you and make you promises, but when it's time to deliver, maybe they'll be with you. ... I'll always be with you," Richardson said. Two months ago, 11 candidates spoke to more than 1,000 union members in Washington. The New Hampshire convention involved only a few dozen union leaders from around the country, a move they hope will allow them to evaluate the candidates more informally. The union will not endorse anyone until August, at the earliest. An IAFF survey after the March gathering showed high marks for Clinton, Edwards, Dodd and Biden, along with Richardson. Delegates were decidedly unimpressed by Obama. "It was a reflection of one performance on one day," said IAFF President Harold Schaitberger. Obama said Friday his March remarks were somber, but shouldn't be construed as a lack of excitement to work with firefighters. "If I need to fire folks up, I can do it," Obama said. "I've heard I can give a pretty good speech." The union backed John Kerry in 2003. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Max Baucus: The AP Interview Mark Foley Scandal Timeline Harry Reid Land Deal Congressional Leadership Financial Disclosure Harry Reid's Ties to Abramoff DeLay and Blunt: Following the Money Congress Goes to Bat for Tribes Buy AP Photo Reprints WASHINGTON (AP) -- People think the Democratic-led Congress is doing just as dreary a job as President Bush, following four months of bitter political standoffs that have seen little progress on Iraq and a host of domestic issues. An AP-Ipsos poll also found that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is a more popular figure than the president and her colleagues on Capitol Hill, though she faces a gender gap in which significantly more women than men support her. The survey found only 35 percent approve of how Congress is handling its job, down 5 percentage points in a month. That gives lawmakers the same bleak approval rating as Bush, who has been mired at about that level since last fall, including his dip to a record low for the AP-Ipsos poll of 32 percent last January. "It's mostly Iraq" plus a lack of progress in other areas, said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., who heads the House GOP's campaign committee. "These are not good numbers for an incumbent, and it doesn't matter if you have an 'R' or a 'D' next to your name." Democrats agree that the problem is largely Iraq, which has dominated this year's session of Congress while producing little more than this month's Bush veto of a bill requiring the withdrawal of U.S. troops. It has also overshadowed House-passed bills on stem cell research, student loans and other subjects that the White House opposes, they say. "People are unhappy, there hasn't been a lot of change in direction, for example in Iraq," said Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., chairman of House Democrats' campaign effort. Rising gasoline prices could also be a factor, lawmakers said. In another measure of popular discontent, the survey found that 71 percent say the country is on the wrong track - about even with the 73 percent who said so last May, the worst level since the AP-Ipsos poll began in December 2003. The survey was taken Monday through Wednesday, before Bush offered to seek compromise with congressional Democrats over a war spending bill setting benchmarks for progress in Iraq. Bush told reporters Thursday that if pollsters had asked his opinion about Iraq last fall, "I'd have said I disapprove of what was going on in Iraq. They could have put me down as part of the disapproval process." That was before his decision to send nearly 30,000 additional troops to Iraq, which "would more likely cause me to approve of what's going on in Iraq," he added. Overall approval of Bush was steady from last month, but fell to 69 percent among Republicans, about 7 percentage points below where it had been in April. Earlier this week, a group of GOP moderate House members warned Bush that the status quo in Iraq could mean Republican election losses next year. "If the war doesn't begin to turn around, Republicans will have problems," said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., who said he supports Bush's Iraq policy. White House spokesman Tony Snow declined to comment on the poll. Congress' approval rating this week was 10 points higher than a year ago, when Republicans were in control. But after bumping up in April, this month's drop left lawmakers' job approval where it was when the year began. April saw Congress defy Bush and send him a bill financing the war and requiring a troop withdrawal, which he vetoed May 1. "People wanted change in Washington" on many issues, not just Iraq, said Rep. Rahm Emanuel, D-Ill., a member of the House Democratic leadership. "I'm not surprised about where people are. They're hearing only about Iraq." Congress' reduced appeal was evident in several categories of people. Only 48 percent of Democrats said they approved of Congress, down from 55 percent last month. That included a 12 percentage point drop among Democratic women, though support from Democratic men remained steady. Approval by minorities also fell a dozen points to 39 percent, with a similar reduction among people whose family incomes exceed $75,000. By region, the steepest drop was in the Midwest, where approval fell by 10 percentage points to 28 percent. Congress' highest approval was in the Northeast, where four in ten gave it a positive rating. As for Pelosi, D-Calif., her overall approval of 45 percent stood 10 points higher than Bush's and Congress'. She was seen favorably by 52 percent of women, but only 39 percent of men. While whites are closely split about her, minorities approve of her job by a 15-point margin. Pelosi's numbers are about where she was last month but slightly lower than in January. In the last month, she has lost significant support from younger voters, college-educated women and Westerners. "Voters are frustrated by the fact that the president refuses to change direction on Iraq," said Pelosi spokesman Brendan Daly. Bush's approval ratings are lowest for his handling of Iraq and domestic issues including health care, with about one-third seeing him favorably. About four in 10 like the job he is doing on the economy and foreign policy. Men give the president higher grades than women do, whites higher than minorities, and married people higher than singles. The AP-Ipsos survey involved telephone interviews with 1,000 adults. It has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Global Warming? Gay Marriage? See Where the Candidates Stand Latest Photos of John McCain McCain says Bush's numbers hurt GOP McCain: Tough for abortion rights rivals McCain criticizes Clinton's Iraq move McCain favors a 'League of Democracies' GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate John McCain said Thursday he believes President Bush's low approval ratings are hurting the GOP yet won't affect the party's 2008 nominee. "I don't think there's any doubt that when the president's polling numbers are low that it harms the Republican Party in general, but I think that when it comes election time that the overwhelming majority of Americans will choose their candidate on the basis of that individual candidate's qualifications, vision and record," McCain said in an interview with The Associated Press. The president's numbers have fallen largely because of his stewardship of the Iraq war. On Tuesday, 11 moderate House Republicans met with Bush at the White House and bluntly told him that the war was unsustainable without public support and that it was damaging GOP political fortunes. McCain, a four-term Arizona senator, said that despite what he called Bush's mismanagement of the war, "there's no doubt that, in my view, the president's not given credit for a healthy economy" or that there hasn't been another terrorist attack on the United States since Sept. 11, 2001. "But life isn't fair," McCain said as he relaxed with a cup of coffee in the lobby of a hotel near the Gerald R. Ford International Airport. He campaigned in Michigan on Wednesday and Thursday before heading to Chicago on his way back to Washington. He said voters not only consider candidates' qualifications and experience but also their performances in presidential debates. McCain, without mentioning him by name, chided former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney during a Republican presidential campaign debate last week over comments Romney made earlier about terrorist leader Osama bin Laden. Romney had said "it's not worth moving heaven and earth, spending billions of dollars, just trying to catch one person" and advocated a broader strategy to defeat Islamic jihadists. McCain called the bin Laden comment "naive." At the debate, Romney defended himself, saying "it's more than Osama bin Laden. But he is going to pay and he will die." McCain shot back that bin Laden was responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent Americans and "we will bring him to justice and I'll follow him to the gates of hell." "We cannot allow a person to slaughter innocent Americans and not be dedicated to doing whatever is necessary to bring that person to justice," McCain said Thursday, explaining his debate comment. The Rev. Al Sharpton, a former Democratic presidential candidate, said Monday that "those of us who believe in God" will defeat Romney for the White House. Sharpton denied he was questioning the Mormon's own belief in God but Romney, while campaigning Wednesday in Iowa, called the remark "bigoted." Asked whether he agreed with Romney about what Sharpton said, McCain said, "I don't usually examine" Sharpton's comments, adding that he doesn't believe Romney's religion is a factor in the race. "I do not believe that the fact that Governor Romney is a Mormon will have the slightest impact - nor should it have any impact - on the judgment of the American people as to who their president should be," said McCain, an Episcopalian. "I soundly reject that notion." McCain also reiterated that he believes it should be up to states to decide the legality of marriage and civil unions for gay couples, which he personally opposes, but that it is all right for such couples to "engage in legal agreements and contracts." These could include agreements in which one partner can make health decisions in the event the other one becomes too ill to do so. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Global Warming? Gay Marriage? See Where the Candidates Stand Latest Photos of John Edwards John Edwards' big ideas costly Edwards discusses time at hedge fund Edwards touts husband's record for women Analysis: Calif. boosts political clout WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential candidate John Edwards is offering more policy proposals than any other candidate in the primary and his ideas are winning loud applause from Democratic audiences. The question is whether other voters will cheer when they see the price tag - more than $125 billion a year. Edwards is quick to acknowledge his spending on health care, energy and poverty reduction comes at a cost, with more plans to come. On Friday, he proposed an $8 billion college scholarship program, an outgrowth of his "College for Everyone" idea in 2005. All told, Edwards' proposals would equal more than $1 trillion if he could get them enacted into law and operational during two White House terms. To put the number in perspective, President Bush has dedicated more than $1.8 trillion to tax cuts. The cost of the Iraq war is nearing $450 billion. And this year's federal budget is about $2.8 trillion. Edwards says fixing the country's problems takes precedence over eliminating the deficit or offering middle-class tax relief like he proposed when running for president in the last election. "I think for me, as opposed to the additional tax relief for the middle class, what's more important is to give them relief from the extraordinary cost of health care, from gasoline prices, the things that they spend money on every single day that are escalating dramatically," Edwards said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. To pay for some of his priorities, Edwards would roll back Bush's tax cuts on Americans making more than $200,000 a year. He also said he would consider raising capital gains taxes to help fund his plans and raise or eliminate the $90,000 cap on individual earnings subject to Social Security taxes to help cover the projected shortfall in the system. Edwards also has proposed spending cuts such as cutting subsidies for the banks that make student loans for a savings of $6 billion a year. He would also save money by trimming the number of Department of Housing and Urban Development employees, negotiating Medicare prescription drug prices and cutting agricultural subsidies for corporate farms, although the campaign did not yet have estimates of how much that would bring in. Edwards' ideas have already opened him to accusations of being just another tax-and-spend liberal, a label put on Walter Mondale, the 1984 Democratic presidential nominee who said he would raise taxes and then lost 49 states to President Reagan. The Republican National Committee accused Edwards of making his first campaign promise to raise taxes. "Edwards' America Will Pay More Taxes," said a news release from the conservative Club for Growth on the day Edwards announced a plan for universal health care that would cost $90 billion to $120 billion. The cost estimate came from Ken Thorpe, an Emory University researcher who provides outside analysis on health care plans for presidential candidates. The estimate he gave the Edwards campaign was $105 billion to $145 billion in 2010 dollars - the year Edwards' plan would go into full effect. However, the campaign changed it to 2007 dollars. His plan would require employers to provide insurance or contribute to the coverage of every worker - and it would require every citizen to get coverage. The government would pay for insurance for lower income Americans and tax credits to help subsidize what other families would have to pay for coverage, funded by abolishing Bush's tax cuts for people who make more than $200,000 a year and by having the government collect more back taxes. Among other annual spending: -$15 billion-$20 billion to help achieve his goal of ending poverty in the U.S. within 30 years. That includes $4.2 billion to increase the earned income tax credit, which refunds payroll and income taxes to low-income people; $4 billion to create 1 million short-term jobs to help the unemployed climb out of poverty; and $3 billion for $500 work bonds to help low-income workers save. -$13 billion energy fund to develop and encourage more efficiency and renewable energy use. That includes $3 billion in tax credits for the production of renewable energy and $1 billion to help the U.S. auto industry modernize with the latest fuel-efficient technology. He said the fund would be paid for by selling $10 billion in greenhouse pollution permits and by ending $3 billion in subsidies for big oil companies. -$1 billion rural recovery plan with initiatives like increased investment in rural small businesses, education, health care and resources to fight methamphetamine abuse. -$5 billion in foreign aid to combat international poverty, including $3 billion to help pay for primary education for every child in the world. Edwards also has promoted other ideas he has in the works, such as an education plan that includes his goal of eliminating financial barriers to college, a border security plan and federal spending on stem cells. But he's yet to announce details or costs. Still, Edwards has been the most forthcoming Democratic candidate when it comes to describing the details of how he would like to run the country. His chief rivals - Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama - have offered few hints about their policy proposals. The ideas are the centerpiece of Edwards' plan to position himself as the party's true progressive in the primary. He hopes the big ideas will attract the liberal Iowa caucus goers, online energy and labor endorsements that he's counting on to propel him to the nomination, said Democratic strategist Chris Lehane. "If the costs become a real issue, it will be a good problem to have for him because the only folks likely to make a real argument against it would be the Republicans, which means his strategy succeeded and he was the nominee," said Lehane, who worked in the Clinton White House and for Al Gore's candidacy in 2000. Edwards said his spending proposals also would take precedence over eliminating the more than $200 billion deficit. He said he would work to lower the deficit and would not let it grow. "Those things cost money, and there's a balance between that and the need to reduce the deficit," said the former North Carolina senator. "And so the threshold question is where is the priority? ... If we're going to do those things, I think it's very difficult to eliminate the deficit - in the short term, impossible." He said he supports House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's requirement that legislation to cut taxes or boost federal benefit programs must be paid for with tax increases or other benefit cuts. But Edwards has yet to explain how he would pay for all his proposals. That will come later this year when he offers his tax plan, the campaign said. "There's definitely a lack of numbers in some of his proposals," said Paul Weinstein Jr., chief operating officer at the centrist Progressive Policy Institute. "I think you should be commended for wanting to provide universal health care and to eliminate poverty. I think it would be more legitimate if he would identify some of the ways in which he would pay for these things." John Edwards campaign Web site: &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FIRED_PROSECUTORS?SITE=TNKNN&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	KnoxNews: News from the Associated Press View all of the AP's breaking news stories Email this page to a friend May 11, 1:05 PM EDT Judge OKs immunity deal in firings probe Buy AP Photo Reprints List of Sampson Documents Withheld from Congress Part I: Sampson-Miers e-mails Part II: Sampson-Miers e-mails Judge OKs immunity deal in firings probe Gonzales deflects Democrats' criticism Excerpts from Gonzales hearing WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge approved an immunity deal Friday allowing former Justice Department aide Monica Goodling to testify before Congress about the firing of eight federal prosecutors. Goodling, who served as the department's White House liaison, has refused to discuss the firings without a guarantee that she will not be prosecuted. Congress agreed to the deal, Justice Department investigators reluctantly agreed not to not oppose it and U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan gave it final approval Friday. "Monica Goodling may not refuse to testify," Hogan began his brief order, which said that Goodling could not be prosecuted for anything other than perjury in connection with her testimony. Lawmakers want to question Goodling as part of an inquiry into whether the Justice Department played politics with the hiring and firing of department officials. What began as an inquiry into whether U.S. attorneys were fired for political reasons has grown to include the role of the White House in the firings and whether the Justice Department officials misled Congress about them. Goodling's lawyer has said that, with an immunity deal, she would cooperate and testify honestly. Justice spokesman Dean Boyd confirmed earlier this month that the department's inspector general and Office of Professional Responsibility were investigating Goodling's role in hiring career attorneys - an unusual responsibility for her to have had. Investigators are trying to determine whether Goodling "may have taken prohibited considerations into account during such review," Boyd told the AP. "Whether or not the allegation is true is currently the subject of the OIG/OPR investigation." Three government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Goodling appears to have sought information about party affiliation while vetting applicants for assistant U.S. attorneys' jobs. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
