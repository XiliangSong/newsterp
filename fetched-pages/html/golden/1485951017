Blair Choreographs End to a Stewardship Dogged by Iraq Then, Mr. Blair set off on what seemed a first stage of a lengthy and closely-scripted goodbye tour, even as Mr. Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, planned an equally busy campaign to persuade Britons of his suitability for the job of prime minister. As a first step to becoming prime minister, Mr. Brown announced his candidacy in the race for the Labor Party leadership, although it is doubtful that he will face serious opposition. Most Labor Party heavyweights who might have challenged Mr. Brown signaled their reluctance to do so in the weeks leading to Mr. Blair’s announcement on Thursday that he would step down on June 27. Two Labor left-wingers who said they would challenge Mr. Brown have failed to reach a deal on which of them should stand, apparently because of a lack of support among Labor lawmakers. Mr. Brown appeared before a crowd of cheering, youthful Labor Party supporters in central London to make his announcement today. “Today I announce that I’m a candidate to be leader of the Labor Party and to lead a new government,” he said. In a clear effort to distance himself from Mr. Blair, he promised greater government accountability, new procedures to allow parliament a voice in going to war and a greater stress on what he called “hearts and minds” alongside military efforts to combat terrorism and promote security. “Tony Blair has led our country for 10 years with distinction, with courage, with passion and with insight and in the weeks and months ahead my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people,” Mr. Brown said. “Today there are new priorities and I offer a new leadership for this new time.” Mr. Brown launched his campaign with a new slogan — “Gordon Brown for Britain” — and a personal manifesto that ranged from his views on society to his plans to visit British troops in Iraq. “Let me set out simply my core belief,” he said. “The Britain I believe in is a Britain of fairness and opportunity for all British citizens — every British citizen with every chance to make the most of themselves, every community fair to every citizen. If you work hard you are better off, if you save you are rewarded, if you play by the rules we will stand by you. “These are for me the best of British values: responsibilities required in return for rights, fairness not just for some but for all who earn it,” he said. “With the challenge of terrorism unlike anything that we have faced, the people of Britain want us strong in defense and security, succeeding not only militarily but also opening a new front, working with our allies to win the battle of hearts and minds at home and abroad,” he went on. He added: “Just as my first act as Chancellor of the Exchequer was to give away power to the Bank of England to restore trust in economic policy, so one of my first acts as Prime Minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament — for example, in decisions about peace and war.” Mr. Brown continued: “In the next few weeks I will also visit our Armed Forces and the Middle East so we learn the lessons we have to learn from the last few years and we focus on the best ways to achieve lasting stability.” And he offered politics of conciliation without the star-dust that marked Mr. Blair’s early years. “I will form a government of all the talents, bringing people together, to listen, to learn and solve problems building on a broad sense of national purpose,” he said. “I do not believe politics is about celebrity,” he said. “When you put yourself forward for leadership, the country has a right to know where you come from, what you believe in and what you want to achieve. My father was a minister. For me, my parents were, and their inspiration still is, my moral compass. It’s a compass which has guided me through each stage of my life. They taught me the importance of integrity and decency, of treating people fairly and of duty to others.” “I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place, where I will always strive to be -- and that’s on people’s side,” he said. But Mr. Brown did not go into detail about foreign policy, particularly his view of the United States. Reluctant to be seen as a lame duck prime minister, Mr. Blair met at 10 Downing Street early today with Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, who praised him at a brief news conference as a “great leader” — a markedly different assessment from that of many British adversaries who criticize his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Blair also pledged to “still do everything I can” to work for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Then he planned to visit outgoing President in Paris, according to British media reports. But during the news conference, he broke away from pondering European and Middle East issues to answer a question from a reporter who wanted to know whether he would support Mr. Brown as his successor. “I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister and to endorse him fully,” Mr. Blair said. “He is an extraordinary and rare talent and it’s a tremendous thing if it’s put at the service of the nation as it now can be. He has shown, as perhaps the most successful Chancellor in our country’s history, that he’s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great Prime Minister,” Mr. Blair said. “I know he’s absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade. I also believe that, as someone who has known him for over 20 years as a friend and a colleague, he can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good,” he said. “I wish him well and, as I say, I’m delighted to support him and endorse him fully,” said Mr. Blair, choosing words Mr. Brown has reportedly been waiting to hear since the two men struck a leadership pact over dinner in 1994 — three years before Labor came to power.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/nyregion/11cnd-dix.html	6 Charged in Fort Dix Plot Held Without Bail - New York Times 6 Charged in Fort Dix Plot Held Without Bail Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 CAMDEN, N.J., May 11 — Six Muslim men from New Jersey and Philadelphia charged with plotting to attack Fort Dix with automatic weapons were ordered held without bail today by a federal magistrate here. The men were arrested on Monday night after a 15-month investigation in which the and two informers who had infiltrated the group taped them training with automatic weapons in rural Pennsylvania, conducting surveillance of military bases in the Northeast, watching videos of and the 9/11 hijackers and trying to buy AK-47 assault rifles. The authorities have described the suspects as Islamic extremists and have said they represent the newest breed of threat: loosely organized domestic militants unconnected to — but inspired by — or other international terror groups. Prosecutors argued today that the men, all of whom were born outside the United States, should be denied bail because they posed a flight risk. Only one of the men, Mohamad Shnewer, requested bail, with his family offering to put up four properties worth $580,000 and requesting that he be placed under house arrest with an electronic monitoring bracelet. An assistant United States attorney, Stephen R. Stigall, argued that house arrest offered no protection to the public because Mr. Shnewer “was living in that same house” as the plan to attack Fort Dix was being put together. United States Magistate Joel Schneider ordered that Mr. Shnewer, along with the five others, be held without bail. They have been held in a detention center in Philadelphia since their arrest. Five of the men — Mohamad Shnewer, 22; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir Duka, 23 — are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. The sixth man, Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He will have a more detailed bail hearing later this week. After the hearing, Michael Huff, the attorney for Dritan Duka, said that defending terror suspects is challenging, “This is post-9/11,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “This is one of the No. 1 things on the public’s mind.” Troy Archie, the lawyer for the defendant Eljvir Duka, complained about the conditions under which his client is being held. Mr. Archie said that Mr. Duka “is basically just sitting in a cell in solitary” and that he had not been allowed to talk to his family. Mr. Archie also said that Mr. Duka’s request for a Koran had been ignored. The defense lawyer also raised questions about the confidential informer who prosecutors said was central to the case. “I just don’t understand how someone could infiltrate an alleged terrorist organization, and my emphasis is on allege , within 30 days of meeting them,” Mr. Archie said. He also questioned the informer’s background, which he said included a criminal record. “Everyone in the community knew him,” Mr. Archie said, “and he was bad news.” More Articles in New York Region &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph Doug Mills/The New York Times Representative Charles B. Rangel, above, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has led negotiations to complete the trade deals along with Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative. Trade Deficit Hits a Six-Month High The New York Times The unusual agreement, which came after weeks of negotiations, would guarantee workers the right to organize, ban child labor and prohibit forced labor in trading-partner countries. It would also require trading partners to enforce environmental laws already on their books and comply with several international environmental agreements. While the understanding was a victory for Democrats, it also represented a shrewd compromise by the White House. The agreement is the first major bipartisan economic deal to emerge since Democrats took control of Congress in January. It has immediate importance for four countries — — that are seeking to enter into trade pacts with the United States. But officials in Washington predicted that the agreement’s effect would go beyond those countries and could be a template for all trade deals, including a possible worldwide accord. Administration officials are hoping that the agreement will cause many Democrats to support future trade deals. They hope that enough Democrats will join with , who generally support such measures, to make passage of the agreements probable, if only narrowly. The negotiations were led on the administration side by Susan C. Schwab, the top trade envoy, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , and on the House side by Representative , Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “I think today is a recognition of the results of the November election,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. “It doesn’t mean that this paves the way for trade agreements where we have other obstacles. But where it comes down to labor standards and environment, this is enormous progress.” Ms. Schwab said that the agreement would send a message to trading partners that the United States was prepared to provide new impetus to the faltering talks for a global trade accord. Democrats have been pressing for worker, environmental and other protections on trade deals without success since President Bush took office in 2001. The absence of such protections has meant that when lawmakers passed measures that lowered trade barriers, they generally did so without the support of Democrats. In the 1990s, President was able to get only 40 percent of his fellow Democrats to endorse the North American Free Trade Agreement, and about 60 percent to support a global trade agreement. Since then, many Democrats have soured on measures to lower trade barriers. The breakthrough came as the politically sensitive trade deficit jumped in March to $63.9 billion, or 10 percent more than February’s revised deficit of $57.9 billion, putting the imbalance at its highest level in six months. The report, issued by the , followed a trend that economists have observed for months: even as growth slows in the United States, expanding economies abroad are creating a need for American exports. In March, exports totaled $126.2 billion, up $2.2 billion from February. Those gains were not enough to offset an $8.2 billion rise in imports, which totaled $190.1 billion. Thursday’s compromise affects four trade deals pending before Congress, two of them signed and two with negotiations that are nearly complete. All four countries would have to accept the provisions agreed to with the Democrats, but trade officials said they expected no major problems. Peru and Panama are considered most likely to win early Congressional approval. Colombia is more problematic, because Democrats are demanding that, besides the new measures, more protections be added to prevent violence against activists trying to organize workers. The South Korea accord, if put in place, would lead to the largest amount of increased trade. But it is opposed in its current version by Democrats who want greater access to that country’s markets for American beef, automobiles and auto parts. National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups hailed the understanding, but said they wanted to study its provisions before endorsing its details. Democrats have been most wary of two administration trade priorities: concluding the global negotiations known as the Doha round, named after the city in Qatar where the talks began six years ago; and extending Mr. Bush’s power to negotiate trade deals on which Congress gets only an up-or-down vote. This negotiating authority, known in Washington shorthand as fast track, has been vigorously opposed by Democrats, who say that they cannot imagine giving Mr. Bush open-ended negotiating authority. But Mr. Rangel said he could imagine a limited extension of such negotiating authority if the Doha round talks looked as if they were shaping up to be a good deal for the United States.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/washington/11cong.html	President Open to Benchmarks in Iraq Measure - New York Times President Open to Benchmarks in Iraq Measure Stephen Crowley/The New York Times President Bush, who visited the Pentagon, said he would agree to setting firm goals for the Iraqi government in the spending bill that is being debated in Congress. Though he had agreed to benchmarks before, Mr. Bush was unwilling to link them to financing or troop withdrawal. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 — Hours before the House approved a plan on Thursday to finance the war only through midsummer, President Bush offered his first public concession to try to resolve the impasse on war spending, acknowledging rising pressure from his own party and the public. After a briefing at the Pentagon, Mr. Bush said he had instructed , the White House chief of staff, to reach “common ground” with lawmakers of both parties over setting firm goals, or benchmarks, to measure progress in Iraq. Mr. Bush had previously insisted that he wanted about $95 billion for the military with no strings attached. “It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward,” Mr. Bush said, even as he threatened to veto the House plan, approved on a 221-to-205 vote Thursday night, which would require him to seek approval in two months for the balance of the war money. Still, Congressional leaders say the plan may never reach his desk, because the Senate is likely to take a different approach. Before the vote on Thursday, House Democrats demonstrated their opposition to continuing the war when 169 of them voted for a separate plan that would have required the withdrawal of American troops to begin in 90 days, with most forces out within another six months. joined in that effort, which failed by a 255-to-171 vote. Still, the plan attracted more support than anticipated. Speaker was among those voting in favor of it. Fifty-nine Democrats, including Representative of Maryland, the majority leader, opposed the proposal along with 196 Republicans. “We finally got to vote for what we believed in,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the withdrawal plan. The bill approved by the House would provide $42.8 billion total, with about $30 billion directed to the war effort for the next two months. It requires the president to report by July 13 on how the Iraqi government is performing in building its military and moving toward achieving political unity. Congress would then vote a second time on whether to give the administration the remainder of the money — about $50 billion — to maintain operations in Iraq through Sept. 30 or to restrict that money to deployment. “No more,” said Mr. Hoyer, who backed the plan. “No more blank checks.” Republicans derided the Democratic approach as war on the installment plan, and they and Mr. Bush said the two-stage financing was unworkable. Once the Senate is through with its negotiations, lawmakers say, a final measure may be ready for the White House by the end of the month. Mr. Bush, who on Tuesday received a blunt assessment from Republican moderates about rising voter unrest over Iraq, acknowledged the public’s impatience with the war. But he said he could not allow political considerations like “the latest opinion poll, or how we can get our members elected” to drive his thinking. “My message to the members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let’s make sure our troops get funded, and let’s make sure politicians don’t tell our commanders how to conduct operations,” Mr. Bush said. Though Republicans voted solidly with the president, many made it clear that the administration had until September — the deadline for a progress report from Gen. , the commander in Iraq — to prove its war strategy was working. While it was Republican moderates who took their complaints directly to the president this week, others in the party expressed similar misgivings on Thursday. “There is a significant undercurrent that is looking for a reasonable way forward in Iraq,” said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a conservative Republican of Nebraska, adding that the war is a leading concern for his constituents. “People are very conflicted in their hearts.” Several Republicans are considering bipartisan legislation aimed at changing the war’s course. Senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and of Tennessee have introduced separate proposals aimed at bringing a gradual end to the war. “We are troubled by the current policy,” Ms. Snowe said Thursday. “The White House needs to hear it.” While the White House has not opposed setting general goals for progress in Iraq, they have resisted any effort to tie financing or troop withdrawal plans to the benchmarks. On Thursday, Democrats welcomed the president’s new willingness to authorize negotiations on benchmarks but said any failure by Iraq to meet specified goals must result in penalties or they would be meaningless. “There is a recognition that things are not going well,” said Senator , Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader. “The only person who doesn’t believe there needs to be a change is the president.” The Senate hopes to consider its version of the war spending measure sometime next week, and Democrats have not made public many of their ideas. Lawmakers and senior administration officials say the most likely course is that the Senate would approve a new measure dropping the withdrawal date Mr. Bush objected to in vetoing the initial legislation but retaining other restrictions, while providing the president the ability to waive them. The White House has not been receptive in the past to proposals for such waivers. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior White House official disputed the notion that Mr. Bush’s agreement to consider signing a bill with specific benchmarks for the Iraqis to meet was tied to Republican complaints that more pressure be brought to bear on the Iraqi government to make faster progress toward political reconciliation. “We’ve said all along there’s going to be a compromise,” he said. The official said the president understood that if General Petraeus delivered a bad assessment of conditions in Iraq in September, it would make it hard for some Republicans to continue supporting the war. For all of the administration’s complaints about the Democratic approach, officials concede that the lawmakers’ efforts to impose a timetable for American withdrawal may at least have helped emphasize the president’s point to the Prime Minister that American patience is wearing thin and Iraq needs to act more urgently toward political reconciliation. Some White House officials privately expressed displeasure Thursday that the concerns the Republican moderates raised with the president became public. Vice President did not mince words in an interview with the Fox News Channel. “We didn’t get elected to be popular,” Mr. Cheney said. “We didn’t get elected to worry just about the fate of the Republican Party.” Some lawmakers said they had lost patience not only with the war in Iraq, but also with the continuing legislative and political conflict in Congress as the two parties maneuver over the war. “The Republicans should not be saying the Democrats don’t support the troops, nor should the Democrats be calling Republicans warmongers,” said Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri and one of the 11 moderates who met with Mr. Bush on Tuesday. “Politics have taken over, and our soldiers deserve better.” Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

The men were arrested on Monday night after a 15-month investigation in which the and two informers who had infiltrated the group taped them training with automatic weapons in rural Pennsylvania, conducting surveillance of military bases in the Northeast, watching videos of and the 9/11 hijackers and trying to buy AK-47 assault rifles. The authorities have described the suspects as Islamic extremists and have said they represent the newest breed of threat: loosely organized domestic militants unconnected to — but inspired by — or other international terror groups. Prosecutors argued today that the men, all of whom were born outside the United States, should be denied bail because they posed a flight risk. Only one of the men, Mohamad Shnewer, requested bail, with his family offering to put up four properties worth $580,000 and requesting that he be placed under house arrest with an electronic monitoring bracelet. An assistant United States attorney, Stephen R. Stigall, argued that house arrest offered no protection to the public because Mr. Shnewer “was living in that same house” as the plan to attack Fort Dix was being put together. United States Magistate Joel Schneider ordered that Mr. Shnewer, along with the five others, be held without bail. They have been held in a detention center in Philadelphia since their arrest. Five of the men — Mohamad Shnewer, 22; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir Duka, 23 — are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. The sixth man, Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. He will have a more detailed bail hearing later this week. After the hearing, Michael Huff, the attorney for Dritan Duka, said that defending terror suspects is challenging, “This is post-9/11,” he said, according to The Associated Press. “This is one of the No. 1 things on the public’s mind.” Troy Archie, the lawyer for the defendant Eljvir Duka, complained about the conditions under which his client is being held. Mr. Archie said that Mr. Duka “is basically just sitting in a cell in solitary” and that he had not been allowed to talk to his family. Mr. Archie also said that Mr. Duka’s request for a Koran had been ignored. The defense lawyer also raised questions about the confidential informer who prosecutors said was central to the case. “I just don’t understand how someone could infiltrate an alleged terrorist organization, and my emphasis is on allege , within 30 days of meeting them,” Mr. Archie said. He also questioned the informer’s background, which he said included a criminal record. “Everyone in the community knew him,” Mr. Archie said, “and he was bad news.” More Articles in New York Region &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. Back Story With The Times's David Sanger ( Little of what Mr. Cheney said in the cavernous hangar bay of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, one of two carriers whose strike groups are now in the Persian Gulf, was new. Each individual line had, in some form, been said before, at various points in the four-year-long nuclear standoff with Iran, and during the increasingly tense arguments over whether Iran is aiding the insurgents in Iraq. But Mr. Cheney stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration’s most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran’s coast was unmistakable. It also came just a week after Secretary of State talked briefly and inconclusively with Iran’s foreign minister, a step toward re-engagement with Iran that some in the administration have opposed. Mr. Cheney’s sharp warnings appeared to be part of a two-track administration campaign to push back at Iran, while leaving the door open to negotiations. It was almost exactly a year ago that the United States offered to negotiate with Iran as long as it first agreed to halt enriching uranium, a decision in which Mr. Cheney, participants said, was not a major player. Similarly, the speech today was not circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered, a senior American diplomat said. “He kind of runs by his own rules,” the official said. When President Bush ordered the two carriers into the Gulf late last year, senior administration officials said it was part of an effort to gain some negotiating leverage over the Iranians. At about the same time, American military personnel began capturing some Iranians in Iraq, and some of them are still held there. American officials have also been pressing Europeans banks and companies to avoid doing business with Tehran, in an effort to make it more difficult for the country to recycle its oil profits. Oil seemed to be on Mr. Cheney’s mind today, when he told an audience of 3,500 to 4,000 American service members on the Stennis that Iran would not be permitted to choke off oil shipments through the waters of the region. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open. We’ll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We’ll disrupt attacks on our own forces. We’ll continue bringing relief to those who suffer, and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom. And we’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Some experts on Iran have questioned whether the threats that administration officials occasionally deliver to Iran aid or undercut the diplomacy with the country. “The problem with the two-track policy is that the first track — coercion, sanctions, naval deployments — can undercut the results on the second track,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic” (Henry Holt, 2006). “There are some in Tehran who will look at Cheney on that carrier and say that everything Rice is offering is not real. What’s real, to their mind, are the coercive policies Cheney is describing. “This is a case where we are trying to get through negotiations what, so far, we couldn’t get through coercion.” The symbols of coercion were part of the backdrop on the Stennis: Mr. Cheney spoke in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes. But mindful of the lasting imagery of President Bush on another carrier a little more than four years ago, there were no signs proclaiming success, much less “Mission Accomplished.” Instead, Mr. Cheney repeated his arguments about the danger of early withdrawal from Iraq. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” Mr. Cheney is on a weeklong visit to the Middle East, and made Iraq his first stop on Wednesday and Thursday. He spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its uranium-enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful nuclear energy, but which America and its Western allies say is intended instead to produce atomic weapons. Administration officials have also said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that insurgents may be getting training in bomb-making and bomb-placing techniques in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq. He also visited Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where the president of Iran, , is expected to arrive in the next few days. Mr. Cheney’s tour is also scheduled to include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad, and Graham Bowley contributed from New York.

Skip to next paragraph Doug Mills/The New York Times Representative Charles B. Rangel, above, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has led negotiations to complete the trade deals along with Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative. Trade Deficit Hits a Six-Month High The New York Times The unusual agreement, which came after weeks of negotiations, would guarantee workers the right to organize, ban child labor and prohibit forced labor in trading-partner countries. It would also require trading partners to enforce environmental laws already on their books and comply with several international environmental agreements. While the understanding was a victory for Democrats, it also represented a shrewd compromise by the White House. The agreement is the first major bipartisan economic deal to emerge since Democrats took control of Congress in January. It has immediate importance for four countries — — that are seeking to enter into trade pacts with the United States. But officials in Washington predicted that the agreement’s effect would go beyond those countries and could be a template for all trade deals, including a possible worldwide accord. Administration officials are hoping that the agreement will cause many Democrats to support future trade deals. They hope that enough Democrats will join with , who generally support such measures, to make passage of the agreements probable, if only narrowly. The negotiations were led on the administration side by Susan C. Schwab, the top trade envoy, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , and on the House side by Representative , Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “I think today is a recognition of the results of the November election,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. “It doesn’t mean that this paves the way for trade agreements where we have other obstacles. But where it comes down to labor standards and environment, this is enormous progress.” Ms. Schwab said that the agreement would send a message to trading partners that the United States was prepared to provide new impetus to the faltering talks for a global trade accord. Democrats have been pressing for worker, environmental and other protections on trade deals without success since President Bush took office in 2001. The absence of such protections has meant that when lawmakers passed measures that lowered trade barriers, they generally did so without the support of Democrats. In the 1990s, President was able to get only 40 percent of his fellow Democrats to endorse the North American Free Trade Agreement, and about 60 percent to support a global trade agreement. Since then, many Democrats have soured on measures to lower trade barriers. The breakthrough came as the politically sensitive trade deficit jumped in March to $63.9 billion, or 10 percent more than February’s revised deficit of $57.9 billion, putting the imbalance at its highest level in six months. The report, issued by the , followed a trend that economists have observed for months: even as growth slows in the United States, expanding economies abroad are creating a need for American exports. In March, exports totaled $126.2 billion, up $2.2 billion from February. Those gains were not enough to offset an $8.2 billion rise in imports, which totaled $190.1 billion. Thursday’s compromise affects four trade deals pending before Congress, two of them signed and two with negotiations that are nearly complete. All four countries would have to accept the provisions agreed to with the Democrats, but trade officials said they expected no major problems. Peru and Panama are considered most likely to win early Congressional approval. Colombia is more problematic, because Democrats are demanding that, besides the new measures, more protections be added to prevent violence against activists trying to organize workers. The South Korea accord, if put in place, would lead to the largest amount of increased trade. But it is opposed in its current version by Democrats who want greater access to that country’s markets for American beef, automobiles and auto parts. National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups hailed the understanding, but said they wanted to study its provisions before endorsing its details. Democrats have been most wary of two administration trade priorities: concluding the global negotiations known as the Doha round, named after the city in Qatar where the talks began six years ago; and extending Mr. Bush’s power to negotiate trade deals on which Congress gets only an up-or-down vote. This negotiating authority, known in Washington shorthand as fast track, has been vigorously opposed by Democrats, who say that they cannot imagine giving Mr. Bush open-ended negotiating authority. But Mr. Rangel said he could imagine a limited extension of such negotiating authority if the Doha round talks looked as if they were shaping up to be a good deal for the United States.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-cheney.html	On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran - New York Times On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 BRUSSELS, May 11 — Vice President used the deck of an American aircraft carrier just 150 miles off ’s coast as the backdrop today to warn the country that the United States was prepared to use its naval power to keep Tehran from disrupting off oil routes or “gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Skip to next paragraph Vice President Dick Cheney on board the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. Back Story With The Times's David Sanger ( Little of what Mr. Cheney said in the cavernous hangar bay of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, one of two carriers whose strike groups are now in the Persian Gulf, was new. Each individual line had, in some form, been said before, at various points in the four-year-long nuclear standoff with Iran, and during the increasingly tense arguments over whether Iran is aiding the insurgents in Iraq. But Mr. Cheney stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration’s most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran’s coast was unmistakable. It also came just a week after Secretary of State talked briefly and inconclusively with Iran’s foreign minister, a step toward re-engagement with Iran that some in the administration have opposed. Mr. Cheney’s sharp warnings appeared to be part of a two-track administration campaign to push back at Iran, while leaving the door open to negotiations. It was almost exactly a year ago that the United States offered to negotiate with Iran as long as it first agreed to halt enriching uranium, a decision in which Mr. Cheney, participants said, was not a major player. Similarly, the speech today was not circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered, a senior American diplomat said. “He kind of runs by his own rules,” the official said. When President Bush ordered the two carriers into the Gulf late last year, senior administration officials said it was part of an effort to gain some negotiating leverage over the Iranians. At about the same time, American military personnel began capturing some Iranians in Iraq, and some of them are still held there. American officials have also been pressing Europeans banks and companies to avoid doing business with Tehran, in an effort to make it more difficult for the country to recycle its oil profits. Oil seemed to be on Mr. Cheney’s mind today, when he told an audience of 3,500 to 4,000 American service members on the Stennis that Iran would not be permitted to choke off oil shipments through the waters of the region. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open. We’ll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We’ll disrupt attacks on our own forces. We’ll continue bringing relief to those who suffer, and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom. And we’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Some experts on Iran have questioned whether the threats that administration officials occasionally deliver to Iran aid or undercut the diplomacy with the country. “The problem with the two-track policy is that the first track — coercion, sanctions, naval deployments — can undercut the results on the second track,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic” (Henry Holt, 2006). “There are some in Tehran who will look at Cheney on that carrier and say that everything Rice is offering is not real. What’s real, to their mind, are the coercive policies Cheney is describing. “This is a case where we are trying to get through negotiations what, so far, we couldn’t get through coercion.” The symbols of coercion were part of the backdrop on the Stennis: Mr. Cheney spoke in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes. But mindful of the lasting imagery of President Bush on another carrier a little more than four years ago, there were no signs proclaiming success, much less “Mission Accomplished.” Instead, Mr. Cheney repeated his arguments about the danger of early withdrawal from Iraq. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” Mr. Cheney is on a weeklong visit to the Middle East, and made Iraq his first stop on Wednesday and Thursday. He spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its uranium-enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful nuclear energy, but which America and its Western allies say is intended instead to produce atomic weapons. Administration officials have also said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that insurgents may be getting training in bomb-making and bomb-placing techniques in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq. He also visited Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where the president of Iran, , is expected to arrive in the next few days. Mr. Cheney’s tour is also scheduled to include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad, and Graham Bowley contributed from New York.

Though he had agreed to benchmarks before, Mr. Bush was unwilling to link them to financing or troop withdrawal. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 — Hours before the House approved a plan on Thursday to finance the war only through midsummer, President Bush offered his first public concession to try to resolve the impasse on war spending, acknowledging rising pressure from his own party and the public. After a briefing at the Pentagon, Mr. Bush said he had instructed , the White House chief of staff, to reach “common ground” with lawmakers of both parties over setting firm goals, or benchmarks, to measure progress in Iraq. Mr. Bush had previously insisted that he wanted about $95 billion for the military with no strings attached. “It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward,” Mr. Bush said, even as he threatened to veto the House plan, approved on a 221-to-205 vote Thursday night, which would require him to seek approval in two months for the balance of the war money. Still, Congressional leaders say the plan may never reach his desk, because the Senate is likely to take a different approach. Before the vote on Thursday, House Democrats demonstrated their opposition to continuing the war when 169 of them voted for a separate plan that would have required the withdrawal of American troops to begin in 90 days, with most forces out within another six months. joined in that effort, which failed by a 255-to-171 vote. Still, the plan attracted more support than anticipated. Speaker was among those voting in favor of it. Fifty-nine Democrats, including Representative of Maryland, the majority leader, opposed the proposal along with 196 Republicans. “We finally got to vote for what we believed in,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the withdrawal plan. The bill approved by the House would provide $42.8 billion total, with about $30 billion directed to the war effort for the next two months. It requires the president to report by July 13 on how the Iraqi government is performing in building its military and moving toward achieving political unity. Congress would then vote a second time on whether to give the administration the remainder of the money — about $50 billion — to maintain operations in Iraq through Sept. 30 or to restrict that money to deployment. “No more,” said Mr. Hoyer, who backed the plan. “No more blank checks.” Republicans derided the Democratic approach as war on the installment plan, and they and Mr. Bush said the two-stage financing was unworkable. Once the Senate is through with its negotiations, lawmakers say, a final measure may be ready for the White House by the end of the month. Mr. Bush, who on Tuesday received a blunt assessment from Republican moderates about rising voter unrest over Iraq, acknowledged the public’s impatience with the war. But he said he could not allow political considerations like “the latest opinion poll, or how we can get our members elected” to drive his thinking. “My message to the members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let’s make sure our troops get funded, and let’s make sure politicians don’t tell our commanders how to conduct operations,” Mr. Bush said. Though Republicans voted solidly with the president, many made it clear that the administration had until September — the deadline for a progress report from Gen. , the commander in Iraq — to prove its war strategy was working. While it was Republican moderates who took their complaints directly to the president this week, others in the party expressed similar misgivings on Thursday. “There is a significant undercurrent that is looking for a reasonable way forward in Iraq,” said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a conservative Republican of Nebraska, adding that the war is a leading concern for his constituents. “People are very conflicted in their hearts.” Several Republicans are considering bipartisan legislation aimed at changing the war’s course. Senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and of Tennessee have introduced separate proposals aimed at bringing a gradual end to the war. “We are troubled by the current policy,” Ms. Snowe said Thursday. “The White House needs to hear it.” While the White House has not opposed setting general goals for progress in Iraq, they have resisted any effort to tie financing or troop withdrawal plans to the benchmarks. On Thursday, Democrats welcomed the president’s new willingness to authorize negotiations on benchmarks but said any failure by Iraq to meet specified goals must result in penalties or they would be meaningless. “There is a recognition that things are not going well,” said Senator , Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader. “The only person who doesn’t believe there needs to be a change is the president.” The Senate hopes to consider its version of the war spending measure sometime next week, and Democrats have not made public many of their ideas. Lawmakers and senior administration officials say the most likely course is that the Senate would approve a new measure dropping the withdrawal date Mr. Bush objected to in vetoing the initial legislation but retaining other restrictions, while providing the president the ability to waive them. The White House has not been receptive in the past to proposals for such waivers. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior White House official disputed the notion that Mr. Bush’s agreement to consider signing a bill with specific benchmarks for the Iraqis to meet was tied to Republican complaints that more pressure be brought to bear on the Iraqi government to make faster progress toward political reconciliation. “We’ve said all along there’s going to be a compromise,” he said. The official said the president understood that if General Petraeus delivered a bad assessment of conditions in Iraq in September, it would make it hard for some Republicans to continue supporting the war. For all of the administration’s complaints about the Democratic approach, officials concede that the lawmakers’ efforts to impose a timetable for American withdrawal may at least have helped emphasize the president’s point to the Prime Minister that American patience is wearing thin and Iraq needs to act more urgently toward political reconciliation. Some White House officials privately expressed displeasure Thursday that the concerns the Republican moderates raised with the president became public. Vice President did not mince words in an interview with the Fox News Channel. “We didn’t get elected to be popular,” Mr. Cheney said. “We didn’t get elected to worry just about the fate of the Republican Party.” Some lawmakers said they had lost patience not only with the war in Iraq, but also with the continuing legislative and political conflict in Congress as the two parties maneuver over the war. “The Republicans should not be saying the Democrats don’t support the troops, nor should the Democrats be calling Republicans warmongers,” said Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri and one of the 11 moderates who met with Mr. Bush on Tuesday. “Politics have taken over, and our soldiers deserve better.” Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/europe/11cnd-blair.html	Blair Endorses Gordon Brown as His Successor - New York Times Blair Endorses Gordon Brown as His Successor Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 LONDON, May 11 — A day after announcing that he would step down in June, Prime Minister offered a fulsome if long-delayed endorsement today of as his successor, calling him “an extraordinary and rare talent.” Skip to next paragraph Gordon Brown with his wife, Sarah, and his campaign manager, Jack Straw, left, launching his campaign for leadership of Britain's Labor Party today in London. Blair Choreographs End to a Stewardship Dogged by Iraq Then, Mr. Blair set off on what seemed a first stage of a lengthy and closely-scripted goodbye tour, even as Mr. Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, planned an equally busy campaign to persuade Britons of his suitability for the job of prime minister. As a first step to becoming prime minister, Mr. Brown announced his candidacy in the race for the Labor Party leadership, although it is doubtful that he will face serious opposition. Most Labor Party heavyweights who might have challenged Mr. Brown signaled their reluctance to do so in the weeks leading to Mr. Blair’s announcement on Thursday that he would step down on June 27. Two Labor left-wingers who said they would challenge Mr. Brown have failed to reach a deal on which of them should stand, apparently because of a lack of support among Labor lawmakers. Mr. Brown appeared before a crowd of cheering, youthful Labor Party supporters in central London to make his announcement today. “Today I announce that I’m a candidate to be leader of the Labor Party and to lead a new government,” he said. In a clear effort to distance himself from Mr. Blair, he promised greater government accountability, new procedures to allow parliament a voice in going to war and a greater stress on what he called “hearts and minds” alongside military efforts to combat terrorism and promote security. “Tony Blair has led our country for 10 years with distinction, with courage, with passion and with insight and in the weeks and months ahead my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people,” Mr. Brown said. “Today there are new priorities and I offer a new leadership for this new time.” Mr. Brown launched his campaign with a new slogan — “Gordon Brown for Britain” — and a personal manifesto that ranged from his views on society to his plans to visit British troops in Iraq. “Let me set out simply my core belief,” he said. “The Britain I believe in is a Britain of fairness and opportunity for all British citizens — every British citizen with every chance to make the most of themselves, every community fair to every citizen. If you work hard you are better off, if you save you are rewarded, if you play by the rules we will stand by you. “These are for me the best of British values: responsibilities required in return for rights, fairness not just for some but for all who earn it,” he said. “With the challenge of terrorism unlike anything that we have faced, the people of Britain want us strong in defense and security, succeeding not only militarily but also opening a new front, working with our allies to win the battle of hearts and minds at home and abroad,” he went on. He added: “Just as my first act as Chancellor of the Exchequer was to give away power to the Bank of England to restore trust in economic policy, so one of my first acts as Prime Minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament — for example, in decisions about peace and war.” Mr. Brown continued: “In the next few weeks I will also visit our Armed Forces and the Middle East so we learn the lessons we have to learn from the last few years and we focus on the best ways to achieve lasting stability.” And he offered politics of conciliation without the star-dust that marked Mr. Blair’s early years. “I will form a government of all the talents, bringing people together, to listen, to learn and solve problems building on a broad sense of national purpose,” he said. “I do not believe politics is about celebrity,” he said. “When you put yourself forward for leadership, the country has a right to know where you come from, what you believe in and what you want to achieve. My father was a minister. For me, my parents were, and their inspiration still is, my moral compass. It’s a compass which has guided me through each stage of my life. They taught me the importance of integrity and decency, of treating people fairly and of duty to others.” “I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place, where I will always strive to be -- and that’s on people’s side,” he said. But Mr. Brown did not go into detail about foreign policy, particularly his view of the United States. Reluctant to be seen as a lame duck prime minister, Mr. Blair met at 10 Downing Street early today with Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, who praised him at a brief news conference as a “great leader” — a markedly different assessment from that of many British adversaries who criticize his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Blair also pledged to “still do everything I can” to work for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Then he planned to visit outgoing President in Paris, according to British media reports. But during the news conference, he broke away from pondering European and Middle East issues to answer a question from a reporter who wanted to know whether he would support Mr. Brown as his successor. “I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister and to endorse him fully,” Mr. Blair said. “He is an extraordinary and rare talent and it’s a tremendous thing if it’s put at the service of the nation as it now can be. He has shown, as perhaps the most successful Chancellor in our country’s history, that he’s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great Prime Minister,” Mr. Blair said. “I know he’s absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade. I also believe that, as someone who has known him for over 20 years as a friend and a colleague, he can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good,” he said. “I wish him well and, as I say, I’m delighted to support him and endorse him fully,” said Mr. Blair, choosing words Mr. Brown has reportedly been waiting to hear since the two men struck a leadership pact over dinner in 1994 — three years before Labor came to power.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

Tech Graduation A Virginia Tech student paying his respects at a memorial to the shooting victims before the start of commencement exercises. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 BLACKSBURG, Va., May 11 — Commencement at the was supposed to be a moment for parents to watch their children take a symbolic step. From a youthful safe haven, students would graduate into a larger and less predictable world. Skip to next paragraph Melanie Blanding for The New York Times A memorial to the victims of the shootings at Virginia Tech. But that harsh unpredictability came to the Virginia Tech campus in April with a deadly shooting rampage. And today, as thousands of parents arrived for graduation ceremonies, it was hard to tell the tears of joy from those of sadness. Students shared giddy hugs and tossed their tassels. In quieter moments, they also spoke of feelings of guilt and the uncomfortable celebrity of having survived. Faculty members regaled proud parents with classroom anecdotes. They also said they still struggled to find the right words to capture the conflicting mix of emotions. “This is supposed to be a celebration,” said Bryan Cloyd, who is both a parent of one the slain students and a professor on campus. Mr. Cloyd carried a distinct trepidation into the ceremonies, but overcame an initial reluctance to join the festivities. He will receive an honorary degree for his 18-year-old daughter, Austin, in hopes of helping remove the “emotional cloud” still looming over campus, he said. “We’re also looking for any healing we can get,” he added. Caroline Merrey, a senior, said she hoped that graduation and the promise of summer would lessen her haunting sense of guilt. “There are lots of days when I think I should have gone back and done something,” said Ms. Merrey, who leapt from a classroom window while her professor, , blocked the door, temporarily keeping the gunman at bay. “I’m lucky that I didn’t get shot and I’m still here. But I feel like what I did was a cheap way out.” Professor Librescu died of gunshot wounds. Ms. Merry said she plans to move in the coming weeks to Chicago, where some of her relatives live, and to start looking there for a job in engineering. Distance and a recent haircut may help restore an anonymity and normalcy that was removed by the shootings, she added. “Graduation is hard enough, because you don’t know what happens next,” she said. “It’s even harder with these emotions, all the media, and the reminders everywhere of what happened.” Karan Grewal, a former suitemate of the gunman, , said his mind drifts to questions he would rather avoid. “I think about why he didn’t start with us back at the suite, and why he went to the other dorm instead,” Mr. Grewal said. “But my philosophy has been that if I let those thoughts take over, then Cho won. So, I focus on enjoying graduation and moving forward.” Looking toward Saturday, when individual departments will hold their own ceremonies, Nikki Giovanni, a poet and English Department professor, said it was a difficult time to be a public speaker. “You have this elephant in the room, and you don’t know how to tame it,” said Ms. Giovanni, who was asked by others on the faculty to speak at her departmental ceremony. “You can’t dwell on what happened, but you can’t overlook it either.” Still, she said, her job was easier than others. She would not need to write much new material, because her department asked her to deliver her poem, “We are Virginia Tech,” again. She presented that poem during a convocation in the days after the shooting, and it became an emotional turning point during that ceremony, bringing a somber crowd to its feet in clapping and chanting. Saturday’s commencement address will be the last time she reads the poem publicly, she said, because she does not want it to become the defining voice of the tragedy. More than with sorrow, Dr. Ishwar K. Puri said he finished the year with an overwhelming sense of awe at the generosity of strangers. Dr. Puri, the chairman of the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, said that when the police sealed off Norris Hall, the site of most of the shooting, as a crime scene, his 24 faculty members, 80 doctoral students and 25 master’s students were left blocked from their laboratories. Their research ground to a halt; so did their ability to apply for jobs or for research grants. But offers to help began arriving almost immediately, he said. The Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands invited his whole faculty to work in its laboratories on paid sabbaticals. Dell, the computer manufacturer, donated 30 laptop and 20 desktop computers to replace those left stranded in the inaccessible laboratories. University opened their laboratories for internships. “Really, this has turned into a story of hope, not despair,” he said. He added, however, that as he looked toward the summer, he had to admit there was a small sense of dread, too. As the spirit of Hokie pride subsides on campus with the departure of students and faculty, Dr. Puri said he was not looking forward to facing a painful task he has put off for weeks: the writing of a job announcement to seek replacements for the two professors in his department who were killed. “Doing that strikes you with the finality of it all,” he said. “How, really, do you replace people who were colleagues, friends, individuals? You can’t.” More Articles in National &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Blair Choreographs End to a Stewardship Dogged by Iraq Then, Mr. Blair set off on what seemed a first stage of a lengthy and closely-scripted goodbye tour, even as Mr. Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, planned an equally busy campaign to persuade Britons of his suitability for the job of prime minister. As a first step to becoming prime minister, Mr. Brown announced his candidacy in the race for the Labor Party leadership, although it is doubtful that he will face serious opposition. Most Labor Party heavyweights who might have challenged Mr. Brown signaled their reluctance to do so in the weeks leading to Mr. Blair’s announcement on Thursday that he would step down on June 27. Two Labor left-wingers who said they would challenge Mr. Brown have failed to reach a deal on which of them should stand, apparently because of a lack of support among Labor lawmakers. Mr. Brown appeared before a crowd of cheering, youthful Labor Party supporters in central London to make his announcement today. “Today I announce that I’m a candidate to be leader of the Labor Party and to lead a new government,” he said. In a clear effort to distance himself from Mr. Blair, he promised greater government accountability, new procedures to allow parliament a voice in going to war and a greater stress on what he called “hearts and minds” alongside military efforts to combat terrorism and promote security. “Tony Blair has led our country for 10 years with distinction, with courage, with passion and with insight and in the weeks and months ahead my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people,” Mr. Brown said. “Today there are new priorities and I offer a new leadership for this new time.” Mr. Brown launched his campaign with a new slogan — “Gordon Brown for Britain” — and a personal manifesto that ranged from his views on society to his plans to visit British troops in Iraq. “Let me set out simply my core belief,” he said. “The Britain I believe in is a Britain of fairness and opportunity for all British citizens — every British citizen with every chance to make the most of themselves, every community fair to every citizen. If you work hard you are better off, if you save you are rewarded, if you play by the rules we will stand by you. “These are for me the best of British values: responsibilities required in return for rights, fairness not just for some but for all who earn it,” he said. “With the challenge of terrorism unlike anything that we have faced, the people of Britain want us strong in defense and security, succeeding not only militarily but also opening a new front, working with our allies to win the battle of hearts and minds at home and abroad,” he went on. He added: “Just as my first act as Chancellor of the Exchequer was to give away power to the Bank of England to restore trust in economic policy, so one of my first acts as Prime Minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament — for example, in decisions about peace and war.” Mr. Brown continued: “In the next few weeks I will also visit our Armed Forces and the Middle East so we learn the lessons we have to learn from the last few years and we focus on the best ways to achieve lasting stability.” And he offered politics of conciliation without the star-dust that marked Mr. Blair’s early years. “I will form a government of all the talents, bringing people together, to listen, to learn and solve problems building on a broad sense of national purpose,” he said. “I do not believe politics is about celebrity,” he said. “When you put yourself forward for leadership, the country has a right to know where you come from, what you believe in and what you want to achieve. My father was a minister. For me, my parents were, and their inspiration still is, my moral compass. It’s a compass which has guided me through each stage of my life. They taught me the importance of integrity and decency, of treating people fairly and of duty to others.” “I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place, where I will always strive to be -- and that’s on people’s side,” he said. But Mr. Brown did not go into detail about foreign policy, particularly his view of the United States. Reluctant to be seen as a lame duck prime minister, Mr. Blair met at 10 Downing Street early today with Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, who praised him at a brief news conference as a “great leader” — a markedly different assessment from that of many British adversaries who criticize his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Blair also pledged to “still do everything I can” to work for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Then he planned to visit outgoing President in Paris, according to British media reports. But during the news conference, he broke away from pondering European and Middle East issues to answer a question from a reporter who wanted to know whether he would support Mr. Brown as his successor. “I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister and to endorse him fully,” Mr. Blair said. “He is an extraordinary and rare talent and it’s a tremendous thing if it’s put at the service of the nation as it now can be. He has shown, as perhaps the most successful Chancellor in our country’s history, that he’s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great Prime Minister,” Mr. Blair said. “I know he’s absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade. I also believe that, as someone who has known him for over 20 years as a friend and a colleague, he can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good,” he said. “I wish him well and, as I say, I’m delighted to support him and endorse him fully,” said Mr. Blair, choosing words Mr. Brown has reportedly been waiting to hear since the two men struck a leadership pact over dinner in 1994 — three years before Labor came to power.

Skip to next paragraph Orlando Kissner/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images Pope Benedict XVI celebrating Mass in S&#227;o Paulo today. Pope Addresses Brazil’s Youth and Meets With the President The faithful carrying images of Pope Benedict XVI and Friar Galvao at the canonization ceremony today in Sao Paulo, Brazil, today. Pope Benedict XVI today in Sao Paulo, Brazil. “No effort should be spared in seeking out those Catholics who have fallen away and those who know little or nothing of Jesus Christ,” he told Brazilian bishops this afternoon at the Cathedral da Sé here. “What is required, in a word, is a mission of evangelization capable of engaging all the vital energies in this immense flock.” About 140 million Brazilians regard themselves as Catholics — the largest Roman Catholic population in the world. But many of them do not attend mass regularly, and the share of the population that identifies itself as Roman Catholic has contracted in less than a generation from nearly 90 percent to about two-thirds, thanks to the Protestant advance. The pope made his appeal in his characteristic way: He emphasized competing with the Pentecostal denominations first by meeting people’s spiritual needs with a back-to-basics Catholicism centered on preaching Christ’s message. He did not stint on providing for people’s social and material needs, but suggested, as he has in the past, that the spiritual dimension is more important, and the true work of the church. Even so, he took note of the dire circumstances in which millions of Latin Americans are mired, and signaled his agreement with what the church here calls a preferential option for the poor. When the people missionaries encounter “are living in poverty,” he said, “it is necessary to help them, as the first Christian communities did, by practicing solidarity and making them feel truly loved.” Within the larger strategy of competing with Protestant denominations, the canonization of Friar Antonio Galvão this morning was a way of marking traditional Catholic territory, and differentiating the church from its rivals. Daily life in Brazil is permeated by the presence of saints, from the names of neighborhoods, businesses and cities — including this one — to the plaster statues found in corner bars and the posters and paintings hung on the walls of homes, both humble and grand. Fast-growing Pentecostal groups, however, strongly disapprove of the popular focus on saints, which they regard as a form of idolatry forbidden by the Bible. In the 1990s, one Pentecostal preacher who was prominent on television even smashed an image of the Virgin Mary to bits during one of his programs, shocking many Brazilians and drawing widespread repudiation. “We Brazilians love to venerate the saints, like St. Anthony and St. George, but until now they’ve all been foreigners,” said Bernardo Leite Alves, a 39-year-old bus driver who said he often drives with an image of St. Sebastian on his windshield. As for Friar Antonio Galvão, he said: “This is a saint who is really, truly ours, born and bred here, who looks like us and has a name like ours.” Friar Antonio de Sant’Anna Galvão was born in 1739 about 100 miles from here, in Guaratinguetá, which Benedict will visit Saturday, and he died here in São Paulo 83 years later. During his lifetime, the city council here designated him a “man of peace and charity,” and he also earned a reputation for defending the poor, which stimulated both popular pilgrimages to his tomb and the use of “Frei Galvão’s pills,” which are said by his devotees to have healing powers. “The significance of Frei Galvão’s example lies in his willingness to be of service to the people whenever he was asked,” Benedict said today. “He was renowned as a counselor, he was a bringer of peace to souls and families and a dispenser of charity, especially toward the poor and the sick. He was greatly sought out as a confessor, because he was zealous, wise and prudent.” , who visited Brazil four times, engaged in a conscious strategy of building grass-roots fidelity to the church by naming hundreds of new saints worldwide. Despite his presence in Brazil to canonize Friar Galvão, Benedict himself has been more conservative, and officials say he will name far fewer saints. At the canonization mass this morning, the faithful were exuberant, waving banners with Frei Galvão’s image and chanting both his name and that of the pope. The church and the nation’s leading television network estimated that one million or more people attended the service, held at an airfield in a working-class area, but the police put the number closer to 800,000. “It is important that the pope be here, so that we can give him an injection of Brazilian joy and happiness,” said Rene Vilela, a 40-year-old bank clerk who was part of a group of 70 that flew here from Salvador, 1,200 miles away, to see the pontiff. “He’s a German, a bit cold and reserved, and so he can benefit from some of our oxygen.” Yet for all the affection they demonstrated, it was also clear that some in the crowd disagreed with the pope on fundamental issues. His condemnation of and contraception and his call for chastity at a meeting with young people on Thursday seemed particularly to go against the grain, in a country proud of its tolerance but ashamed of its poverty. “I’ve been in one-room houses in the slums where parents are trying to raise a dozen kids, and so I think his position on abortion is much too rigid,” said Maria Salete Simões, a 70-year-old retired school teacher. “This is a complicated, controversial subject that needs to be debated more, and the church’s position is just that — the church’s, and not that of society.” Romana Coutinho, a 25-year-old student, said she was pleased by the canonization of a Brazilian saint, but that it would not affect her attitude towards mass, which she said she attends “only sporadically.” She said that she had tried Pentecostal churches, but objected to their constant calls for donations, and wanted the Roman Catholic church to be more flexible on questions of both doctrine and liturgy. “God is joy, so the worship service should be more uplifting and animated,” she said. “If Jesus were alive today, I can’t imagine that he would espouse all of the things that are attributed to him, because the world has changed. The church needs to be more up to date.” More Articles in International &#x00bb; Start your 14-day free trial of TimesSelect now.

Dr. Puri, the chairman of the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics, said that when the police sealed off Norris Hall, the site of most of the shooting, as a crime scene, his 24 faculty members, 80 doctoral students and 25 master’s students were left blocked from their laboratories. Their research ground to a halt; so did their ability to apply for jobs or for research grants. But offers to help began arriving almost immediately, he said. The Technical University of Delft in the Netherlands invited his whole faculty to work in its laboratories on paid sabbaticals. Dell, the computer manufacturer, donated 30 laptop and 20 desktop computers to replace those left stranded in the inaccessible laboratories. University opened their laboratories for internships. “Really, this has turned into a story of hope, not despair,” he said. He added, however, that as he looked toward the summer, he had to admit there was a small sense of dread, too. As the spirit of Hokie pride subsides on campus with the departure of students and faculty, Dr. Puri said he was not looking forward to facing a painful task he has put off for weeks: the writing of a job announcement to seek replacements for the two professors in his department who were killed. “Doing that strikes you with the finality of it all,” he said. “How, really, do you replace people who were colleagues, friends, individuals? You can’t.” More Articles in National &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-cheney.html?ex=1336536000&en=e5527828a00da7bb&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss	On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran - New York Times On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 BRUSSELS, May 11 — Vice President used the deck of an American aircraft carrier just 150 miles off ’s coast as the backdrop today to warn the country that the United States was prepared to use its naval power to keep Tehran from disrupting off oil routes or “gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Skip to next paragraph Vice President Dick Cheney on board the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. Back Story With The Times's David Sanger ( Little of what Mr. Cheney said in the cavernous hangar bay of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, one of two carriers whose strike groups are now in the Persian Gulf, was new. Each individual line had, in some form, been said before, at various points in the four-year-long nuclear standoff with Iran, and during the increasingly tense arguments over whether Iran is aiding the insurgents in Iraq. But Mr. Cheney stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration’s most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran’s coast was unmistakable. It also came just a week after Secretary of State talked briefly and inconclusively with Iran’s foreign minister, a step toward re-engagement with Iran that some in the administration have opposed. Mr. Cheney’s sharp warnings appeared to be part of a two-track administration campaign to push back at Iran, while leaving the door open to negotiations. It was almost exactly a year ago that the United States offered to negotiate with Iran as long as it first agreed to halt enriching uranium, a decision in which Mr. Cheney, participants said, was not a major player. Similarly, the speech today was not circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered, a senior American diplomat said. “He kind of runs by his own rules,” the official said. When President Bush ordered the two carriers into the Gulf late last year, senior administration officials said it was part of an effort to gain some negotiating leverage over the Iranians. At about the same time, American military personnel began capturing some Iranians in Iraq, and some of them are still held there. American officials have also been pressing Europeans banks and companies to avoid doing business with Tehran, in an effort to make it more difficult for the country to recycle its oil profits. Oil seemed to be on Mr. Cheney’s mind today, when he told an audience of 3,500 to 4,000 American service members on the Stennis that Iran would not be permitted to choke off oil shipments through the waters of the region. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open. We’ll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We’ll disrupt attacks on our own forces. We’ll continue bringing relief to those who suffer, and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom. And we’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Some experts on Iran have questioned whether the threats that administration officials occasionally deliver to Iran aid or undercut the diplomacy with the country. “The problem with the two-track policy is that the first track — coercion, sanctions, naval deployments — can undercut the results on the second track,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic” (Henry Holt, 2006). “There are some in Tehran who will look at Cheney on that carrier and say that everything Rice is offering is not real. What’s real, to their mind, are the coercive policies Cheney is describing. “This is a case where we are trying to get through negotiations what, so far, we couldn’t get through coercion.” The symbols of coercion were part of the backdrop on the Stennis: Mr. Cheney spoke in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes. But mindful of the lasting imagery of President Bush on another carrier a little more than four years ago, there were no signs proclaiming success, much less “Mission Accomplished.” Instead, Mr. Cheney repeated his arguments about the danger of early withdrawal from Iraq. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” Mr. Cheney is on a weeklong visit to the Middle East, and made Iraq his first stop on Wednesday and Thursday. He spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its uranium-enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful nuclear energy, but which America and its Western allies say is intended instead to produce atomic weapons. Administration officials have also said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that insurgents may be getting training in bomb-making and bomb-placing techniques in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq. He also visited Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where the president of Iran, , is expected to arrive in the next few days. Mr. Cheney’s tour is also scheduled to include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad, and Graham Bowley contributed from New York.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/americas/11cnd-pope.html	Pope Canonizes Brazil&#8217;s First Native-Born Saint - New York Times Pope Canonizes Brazil’s First Native-Born Saint Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 , May 11 — After canonizing Brazil’s first native-born saint and receiving a bracing dose of Brazilian-style religious fervor at an outdoor mass here today, called for more forceful evangelization efforts throughout Latin America to counter growing conversions to Pentecostal Protestant groups. Skip to next paragraph Orlando Kissner/Agence France-Presse - Getty Images Pope Benedict XVI celebrating Mass in S&#227;o Paulo today. Pope Addresses Brazil’s Youth and Meets With the President The faithful carrying images of Pope Benedict XVI and Friar Galvao at the canonization ceremony today in Sao Paulo, Brazil, today. Pope Benedict XVI today in Sao Paulo, Brazil. “No effort should be spared in seeking out those Catholics who have fallen away and those who know little or nothing of Jesus Christ,” he told Brazilian bishops this afternoon at the Cathedral da Sé here. “What is required, in a word, is a mission of evangelization capable of engaging all the vital energies in this immense flock.” About 140 million Brazilians regard themselves as Catholics — the largest Roman Catholic population in the world. But many of them do not attend mass regularly, and the share of the population that identifies itself as Roman Catholic has contracted in less than a generation from nearly 90 percent to about two-thirds, thanks to the Protestant advance. The pope made his appeal in his characteristic way: He emphasized competing with the Pentecostal denominations first by meeting people’s spiritual needs with a back-to-basics Catholicism centered on preaching Christ’s message. He did not stint on providing for people’s social and material needs, but suggested, as he has in the past, that the spiritual dimension is more important, and the true work of the church. Even so, he took note of the dire circumstances in which millions of Latin Americans are mired, and signaled his agreement with what the church here calls a preferential option for the poor. When the people missionaries encounter “are living in poverty,” he said, “it is necessary to help them, as the first Christian communities did, by practicing solidarity and making them feel truly loved.” Within the larger strategy of competing with Protestant denominations, the canonization of Friar Antonio Galvão this morning was a way of marking traditional Catholic territory, and differentiating the church from its rivals. Daily life in Brazil is permeated by the presence of saints, from the names of neighborhoods, businesses and cities — including this one — to the plaster statues found in corner bars and the posters and paintings hung on the walls of homes, both humble and grand. Fast-growing Pentecostal groups, however, strongly disapprove of the popular focus on saints, which they regard as a form of idolatry forbidden by the Bible. In the 1990s, one Pentecostal preacher who was prominent on television even smashed an image of the Virgin Mary to bits during one of his programs, shocking many Brazilians and drawing widespread repudiation. “We Brazilians love to venerate the saints, like St. Anthony and St. George, but until now they’ve all been foreigners,” said Bernardo Leite Alves, a 39-year-old bus driver who said he often drives with an image of St. Sebastian on his windshield. As for Friar Antonio Galvão, he said: “This is a saint who is really, truly ours, born and bred here, who looks like us and has a name like ours.” Friar Antonio de Sant’Anna Galvão was born in 1739 about 100 miles from here, in Guaratinguetá, which Benedict will visit Saturday, and he died here in São Paulo 83 years later. During his lifetime, the city council here designated him a “man of peace and charity,” and he also earned a reputation for defending the poor, which stimulated both popular pilgrimages to his tomb and the use of “Frei Galvão’s pills,” which are said by his devotees to have healing powers. “The significance of Frei Galvão’s example lies in his willingness to be of service to the people whenever he was asked,” Benedict said today. “He was renowned as a counselor, he was a bringer of peace to souls and families and a dispenser of charity, especially toward the poor and the sick. He was greatly sought out as a confessor, because he was zealous, wise and prudent.” , who visited Brazil four times, engaged in a conscious strategy of building grass-roots fidelity to the church by naming hundreds of new saints worldwide. Despite his presence in Brazil to canonize Friar Galvão, Benedict himself has been more conservative, and officials say he will name far fewer saints. At the canonization mass this morning, the faithful were exuberant, waving banners with Frei Galvão’s image and chanting both his name and that of the pope. The church and the nation’s leading television network estimated that one million or more people attended the service, held at an airfield in a working-class area, but the police put the number closer to 800,000. “It is important that the pope be here, so that we can give him an injection of Brazilian joy and happiness,” said Rene Vilela, a 40-year-old bank clerk who was part of a group of 70 that flew here from Salvador, 1,200 miles away, to see the pontiff. “He’s a German, a bit cold and reserved, and so he can benefit from some of our oxygen.” Yet for all the affection they demonstrated, it was also clear that some in the crowd disagreed with the pope on fundamental issues. His condemnation of and contraception and his call for chastity at a meeting with young people on Thursday seemed particularly to go against the grain, in a country proud of its tolerance but ashamed of its poverty. “I’ve been in one-room houses in the slums where parents are trying to raise a dozen kids, and so I think his position on abortion is much too rigid,” said Maria Salete Simões, a 70-year-old retired school teacher. “This is a complicated, controversial subject that needs to be debated more, and the church’s position is just that — the church’s, and not that of society.” Romana Coutinho, a 25-year-old student, said she was pleased by the canonization of a Brazilian saint, but that it would not affect her attitude towards mass, which she said she attends “only sporadically.” She said that she had tried Pentecostal churches, but objected to their constant calls for donations, and wanted the Roman Catholic church to be more flexible on questions of both doctrine and liturgy. “God is joy, so the worship service should be more uplifting and animated,” she said. “If Jesus were alive today, I can’t imagine that he would espouse all of the things that are attributed to him, because the world has changed. The church needs to be more up to date.” More Articles in International &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

But Mr. Giuliani argued that the presidential election should not turn on social issues, but on which party would better protect the nation from terrorism. Mr. Giuliani suggested that his own record as mayor of New York – leading the city after the attacks of Sept. 11 and overseeing a dramatic decline in violent crime during his eight years in Gracie Mansion – made him the most electable of the Republican candidates, no matter his stand on issues like abortion. During last week’s debate among Republicans vying for their party’s 2008 presidential nomination, the former New York City mayor was criticized for his halting and apparently contradictory responses to questions about his views on abortion rights. Critics have said that he is trying to run from a record that is much more liberal than the views of the Republican Party’s core voters on the issue. The speech by Mr. Giuliani reflected a critical strategic decision – other campaigns used the word gamble – as he seeks to overcome what has been one of the fundamental obstacles to winning the nomination: his long history, as a Northeast Republican in a party increasingly dominated by southern and midwestern conservatives, of breaking with much of the party’s base on issues that are of intense importance to them. Mr. Giuliani told his audience today that he knew that some voters might disagree with him. But he urged the party to become a “big tent” that could include people with a range of views on the subject. At the same time, he said he owed it to them to be forthright about his own views. “I should honestly tell you what I believe,” Mr. Giuliani said. “I should honestly tell you the things that I can evolve on, and the things that I can’t, and then you should decide.” He said, as he has before, that he personally opposed abortion but believed in a woman’s right to make her own decisions; that he believes in the right to bear arms, but that as mayor of New York, he favored certain aspects of gun control; and that while he opposes gay marriage, he supports protecting gay rights, something he said he did as mayor. On abortion, he said he was open to seeking ways to limit the procedure, but he was not open to limiting the right to have it. “In a country like ours, where people of good faith, people who are equally decent and equally moral and equally religious, where they come to different conclusions about this, about something so very, very personal, I think you have to respect their viewpoint,” he said. “I would grant women the right to make that choice.” He said that while his views might put him at odds with many in his own party, he said he did not believe many of them would base their votes on a single issue. He asked the crowd to weigh other factors too, including “fighting terrorism effectively, being on offense against terror, having a growth economy, having a fiscal conservative.” Mr. Giuliani’s aides say their polling has found a relatively small number of voters who would base their vote solely on abortion. They have also said that they are counting on the impression many voters seem to have of Mr. Giuliani as a tough leader who helped turn around New York City in the 1990s, and carried it through the attacks of Sept. 11.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-cheney.html	On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran - New York Times On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 BRUSSELS, May 11 — Vice President used the deck of an American aircraft carrier just 150 miles off ’s coast as the backdrop today to warn the country that the United States was prepared to use its naval power to keep Tehran from disrupting off oil routes or “gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Skip to next paragraph Vice President Dick Cheney on board the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. Back Story With The Times's David Sanger ( Little of what Mr. Cheney said in the cavernous hangar bay of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. John C. Stennis, one of two carriers whose strike groups are now in the Persian Gulf, was new. Each individual line had, in some form, been said before, at various points in the four-year-long nuclear standoff with Iran, and during the increasingly tense arguments over whether Iran is aiding the insurgents in Iraq. But Mr. Cheney stitched all of those warnings together, and the symbolism of sending the administration’s most famous hawk to deliver the speech so close to Iran’s coast was unmistakable. It also came just a week after Secretary of State talked briefly and inconclusively with Iran’s foreign minister, a step toward re-engagement with Iran that some in the administration have opposed. Mr. Cheney’s sharp warnings appeared to be part of a two-track administration campaign to push back at Iran, while leaving the door open to negotiations. It was almost exactly a year ago that the United States offered to negotiate with Iran as long as it first agreed to halt enriching uranium, a decision in which Mr. Cheney, participants said, was not a major player. Similarly, the speech today was not circulated broadly in the government before it was delivered, a senior American diplomat said. “He kind of runs by his own rules,” the official said. When President Bush ordered the two carriers into the Gulf late last year, senior administration officials said it was part of an effort to gain some negotiating leverage over the Iranians. At about the same time, American military personnel began capturing some Iranians in Iraq, and some of them are still held there. American officials have also been pressing Europeans banks and companies to avoid doing business with Tehran, in an effort to make it more difficult for the country to recycle its oil profits. Oil seemed to be on Mr. Cheney’s mind today, when he told an audience of 3,500 to 4,000 American service members on the Stennis that Iran would not be permitted to choke off oil shipments through the waters of the region. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said. “We’ll keep the sea lanes open. We’ll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We’ll disrupt attacks on our own forces. We’ll continue bringing relief to those who suffer, and delivering justice to the enemies of freedom. And we’ll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region.” Some experts on Iran have questioned whether the threats that administration officials occasionally deliver to Iran aid or undercut the diplomacy with the country. “The problem with the two-track policy is that the first track — coercion, sanctions, naval deployments — can undercut the results on the second track,” said Ray Takeyh, an Iran scholar at the Council of Foreign Relations and the author of “Hidden Iran: Paradox and Power in the Islamic Republic” (Henry Holt, 2006). “There are some in Tehran who will look at Cheney on that carrier and say that everything Rice is offering is not real. What’s real, to their mind, are the coercive policies Cheney is describing. “This is a case where we are trying to get through negotiations what, so far, we couldn’t get through coercion.” The symbols of coercion were part of the backdrop on the Stennis: Mr. Cheney spoke in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes. But mindful of the lasting imagery of President Bush on another carrier a little more than four years ago, there were no signs proclaiming success, much less “Mission Accomplished.” Instead, Mr. Cheney repeated his arguments about the danger of early withdrawal from Iraq. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” Mr. Cheney is on a weeklong visit to the Middle East, and made Iraq his first stop on Wednesday and Thursday. He spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its uranium-enrichment program, which Iran says is for peaceful nuclear energy, but which America and its Western allies say is intended instead to produce atomic weapons. Administration officials have also said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that insurgents may be getting training in bomb-making and bomb-placing techniques in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq. He also visited Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates, where the president of Iran, , is expected to arrive in the next few days. Mr. Cheney’s tour is also scheduled to include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad, and Graham Bowley contributed from New York.
