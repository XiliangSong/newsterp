(AP) -- After a six-week trial, a federal jury convicted a Chinese-born engineer of conspiring to export U.S. defense technology to China, including data on an electronic propulsion system that could make submarines virtually undetectable. Friends and colleagues knew Chi Mak as an unassuming, brilliant man who worked 12-hour days as an engineer for a defense contractor, rarely went out and scrimped to pay off his 700-square-foot suburban home. Federal prosecutors portrayed Mak as a polished agent for the Chinese who used his low-key lifestyle and good reputation as a cover for his real work - conspiring to pass U.S. secrets for more than two decades. The jury sided with the government, also finding Mak guilty of acting as an unregistered foreign agent, attempting to violate export control laws and making false statements to the FBI. Prosecutors had dropped a charge of the actual export of defense articles. Mak stared straight ahead and seemed to hold back tears as the verdict was read. One of his attorneys gently rubbed his back. Assistant U.S. Attorney Greg Staples said Mak faces up to 45 years in prison when he is sentenced Sept. 10. "We were confident from the start and we're very happy with the verdict," Staples said. The government accused Mak, a naturalized U.S. citizen, of taking thousands of pages of documents from his defense contractor employer, Power Paragon of Anaheim, and giving them to his brother, who passed them along to Chinese authorities over a number of years. Mak was arrested in 2005 in Los Angeles after FBI agents stopped his brother and sister-in-law as they boarded a flight to Hong Kong. Investigators said they found three encrypted CDs in their luggage that contained documents on a submarine propulsion system, a solid-state power switch for ships and a Power Point presentation on the future of power electronics. Mak acknowledged during the trial that he copied classified documents from his employer and kept copies in his office. He maintained he didn't realize that making the copies was illegal. Chi Mak's wife, brother and other relatives also have been indicted and go on trial together on June 5. Staples said the government may use the verdict to try to negotiate plea bargains with Mak's indicted family members, who pleaded not guilty. Defense attorneys Marilyn Bednarski and Ronald Kaye said they would appeal the verdict, insisting the government had manipulated the facts. In many instances, the government was allowed to present classified information to U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney in his chambers, and the defense team was not allowed to view the government's application for a warrant to bug Mak's house and car, Kaye said. "It is so absurd to believe that he has been passing technology for 20 years when they had not one witness and not one piece of paper to corroborate this," Kaye said. The trial featured testimony from FBI agents, U.S. Navy officials, encryption and espionage experts and the engineer himself. Key to the trial was the government's allegation that Mak confessed to the conspiracy - and even named his so-called "handler" and specific restricted documents - during an untaped jailhouse interview two days after his arrest. Mak testified he never confessed during that interview, but admitted on cross-examination that he lied repeatedly in an earlier taped interview about the number of times he had visited China and when he told authorities he didn't have friends or relatives there. He said he felt intimidated during the interrogation. "This is why I lied," he said. "They were pushing me that night." Mak's attorneys focused on a paper he had written on the propulsion system that was found in his brother's luggage at Los Angeles International Airport. Mak said he believed he was doing nothing wrong by giving the paper to his brother to take out of the country because he had written it for Power Paragon and had presented it at an engineering conference in 2004. The government, however, alleged the documents were export-controlled and couldn't fall into foreigners' hands. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Tech Fields Merchandise Requests BLACKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Some families of the 32 shooting victims couldn't bear to attend Virginia Tech's graduation Friday. Others said they had no choice but to come. "We have to. This is right for us," said Peter Read, whose freshman daughter Mary Karen Read was among those killed in the April 16 attack. The school issued diplomas and class rings to him and relatives of the other 26 student victims. Five faculty members were also slain before the gunman killed himself. Read had traveled from Annandale with 15 family members for the ceremony, which he said "recognizes what all of the students were here to do. It validates their choices, and it validates what they were doing." School spokesman Mark Owczarski said security remains high because some families may feel unsettled returning to the campus. Typical to measures for a home football game, bags will be checked before the ceremony, but guests will not pass through metal detectors or undergo more intrusive security measures. Gen. John Abizaid, who oversaw Operation Iraqi Freedom, is the keynote speaker. In Washington, D.C., President Bush issued a statement praising "the compassion and resilient spirit" of the Virginia Tech community and the 3,600 graduating seniors and others earning advanced or associate degrees. "Laura and I salute the Virginia Tech Class of 2007. We also remember the students and teachers whose lives were taken last month," he said. "They will always hold a special place in the hearts of this graduating class and an entire nation." Twins Andrea and Michelle Falletti of Chantilly, Va., said they will not let the shootings overshadow their college memories of , spring breaks, camping trips and partying with friends. Their parents and grandparents will be in the audience, and it will, in many ways, still be the graduation they've long envisioned. "Obviously, what has happened has affected everything in our lives, and it will affect graduation," said Andrea Falletti, 21. "In a way, it's not going to be celebrating us as much; it's more about what we've done as a community. But that's OK. I'm proud of what we've done here." Richard Roopan, a business information technology major who posed for photos Thursday in his cap and gown outside Torgersen Hall, said the atmosphere on campus was "a little bit more somber than celebratory." After nearly four weeks of mourning, Roopan said he hopes there will be some joy. "But you have to remember them, also, and what they could have done and their achievements and how, you know, this moment that we have right now has been taken away from them," he said. Leaving Blacksburg won't be easy, Andrea Falletti said. "It's brought us closer, but in a different way," she said. "We're all kind of having these same feelings now. It's kind of a special thing."

British Police Make 4 Terror Arrests Doctor in Terror Trial Defends Himself Dix Plot Shows Homegrown Radical Threat Video Allegedly Shows Algerian Attack CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) -- Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday night during what the FBI said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. The clerk called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men - Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 - are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The remarks were made on their show Wednesday by a guest the duo call Homeless Charlie. As the name of each woman came up, the guest said he would like to have sex with her - using language not fit for print. Opie and Anthony laughed as they imagined Rice's "horror" while describing a violent sexual encounter in which Rice is punched in the face. Washington-based XM condemned the remarks. "We deplore the comments made on Wednesday's 'Opie & Anthony Show,'" XM spokesman Nathaniel Brown told The Associated Press on Friday. He would not say whether XM planned to take disciplinary action. Opie and Anthony, whose full names are Anthony Cumia and Greg "Opie" Hughes, apologized to listeners on Friday's show. "We apologize to the public officials for comments that we made on our XM show on May 9th. We take very seriously the responsibility that comes with our creative freedom and regret any offense that this segment has caused," they said. Because the show airs on satellite radio, there are no federal restrictions on its content. According to XM's Web site, the radio service has parental controls that allow users to block access to channels that frequently contain explicit language. Those channels are designated with an "XL" notation. The same radio duo was dumped by CBS Radio in August 2002 for running a contest in which they said two listeners had sex in New York's St. Patrick's Cathedral. They were hired by XM in 2004. The remarks could become an issue as XM seeks approval from the Federal Communications Commission to merge with New York-based Sirius Satellite Radio, said Tom Taylor, editor of the trade magazine Inside Radio. "XM and Sirius don't want any regulation," he said in Friday's New York Daily News. "But it's come up in four congressional hearings - and at this point, the merger is such a close call, any issue could become important." &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

School Evacuated Over Odd Bottle Buy AP Photo Reprints TIMONIUM, Md. (AP) -- A high school was evacuated Friday after firefighters found a bottle containing a suspicious liquid in a classroom, and a teacher was taken to a hospital for dizziness. Firefighters could not immediately identify the odor coming from the bottle, which was in a trash can at Dulaney High School in a suburb of Baltimore, said Pierce Jones, a spokesman for the Baltimore County Fire Department. Police said a chemistry lab, a bathroom and a hallway were affected. The ill teacher was taken to a local hospital, Jones said. No other injuries were reported. The fire department's hazardous materials team and members of the county police bomb squad were on the scene as a precaution, Jones said. The incident was reported just before 8 a.m., said Sgt. John Young of the Baltimore County Police Department. Principal Lyle Patzkowsky said he expected the school's 1,850 students to return to the building before noon. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

Peter Berdovsky, 27, and Sean Stevens, 28, said they never expected the stunt to cause any turmoil. "I deeply regret that this incident caused such anguish and disruption to so many people," Berdovsky told the Charlestown District Court. Stevens said he saw the devices simply as "harmless entertainment." "I had no intention of upsetting or alarming anyone," he said. The two were accused of planting about three dozen battery-powered devices in Boston and Cambridge on Jan. 31. The devices, a promotion for Cartoon Network, had lights that created images of a cartoon character making an obscene gesture. Fears of terrorism arose when the devices were discovered in a subway station and on a bridge, among other locations. Bomb squads were deployed, and highways, bridges and some transit stations were temporarily closed. Similar signs were placed in nine other cities around the United States, but only in Boston did they elicit such a response. Berdovsky and Stevens were charged with placing a hoax device and disorderly conduct. In exchange for the community service and public apology, prosecutors agreed not to pursue the criminal case. Berdovsky performed 80 hours of service and Stevens completed 60 hours at the Spaulding Rehabilitation Center in Boston. Attorney General Martha Coakley said it would have been difficult to prove to a jury that the men intended to create panic, and that she did not believe they realized the problems the ads would cause. "We believe this was an appropriate and fair resolution," Coakley said. Berdovsky said he was relieved the case was resolved without a trial. "I am looking forward to what the future has to bring. I'm just going to be working really hard and working on my art and working to build a really peaceful community for all of us to live in," Berdovsky told The Associated Press by telephone after the hearing. At Spaulding, the men designed a cartoon mural that will be painted in a waiting area for children undergoing physical therapy, said Oz Mondejar, Spaulding's vice president of human resources. They also helped patients use computers, cleaned the hospital's sailing docks and helped produce a DVD featuring patients talking about their rehabilitation successes. The contrite apologies offered in court Friday were in contrast to their behavior at their first court appearance in January, when they mugged for the camera and waved to friends in the courtroom. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

Calif. Island Wildfire Fire Threatens Posh, SoCal Resort Island Buy AP Photo Reprints AVALON, Calif. (AP) -- Firefighters working through the night turned back flames that threatened Santa Catalina Island's main city and forced hundreds of people to evacuate amid falling ashes. The wildfire was 4,000 acres, or more than 6 square miles, and was only 10 percent contained early Friday. But worries were eased by the day's favorable weather forecast and the arrival of a massive force of fire trucks and water-dropping aircraft on the narrow, mountainous island 30 miles off Los Angeles. Flames that had menaced the city the night before were no longer visible from Avalon on Friday. A puff of smoke rose from a hillside overlooking the crescent harbor and a layer of ash were reminders of a harrowing night. "The risk has been reduced significantly," Fire Chief Steven Hoefs said. "Most of the structures have been protected." The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon, feeding on dry brush and being fanned by a steady wind into the night. One home and a few small businesses in the canyons outside the city burned. About 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders, and hundreds of residents and tourists lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas to ward off ashes. Resident Kathy Troeger fled with her three children and a friend's daughter, while her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to fight the blaze. "It was like a nightmare when we left," she said after arriving at the mainland port of Long Beach. "You couldn't breathe, and ash was falling like snow." Dozens of fire engines arrived through the night from as far away as Fresno, carried by giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps' Camp Pendleton. Friday's forecast promised better firefighting conditions. Wind that reached 20 mph Thursday were expected to calm to 10 mph and were blowing the fire westward, away from Avalon and toward the island's sparsely populated center. Despite being well offshore, Catalina has been left parched by the lack of rainfall that has made the rest of Southern California particularly susceptible to wildfires like the one in Los Angeles' Griffith Park this week. Firefighters were still working Friday to surround what remained of that fire, which briefly chased people from homes and threatened the park's landmark observatory and zoo. Elsewhere around the country, firefighters battled the second Georgia wildfire to burn more than 100,000 acres as gusty wind spread the fast-moving blaze further into northern Florida and toward the tiny town of Fargo west of the Okefenokee Swamp. Officials said the wildfire, ignited Saturday by lightning, had grown so rapidly that after six days it already rivaled a fire that has scorched 116,480 acres, or 182 square miles, of southeastern Georgia forest and swampland since April 16 - the state's largest wildfire on record. About 570 homes in northern Columbia County, Fla., were evacuated overnight, and heavy smoke blanketed the area. In Minnesota, a wildfire that has already destroyed 45 structures threatened about 200 more structures and closed half of the 57-mile Gunflint Trail. The fire has burned about 45 square miles since it started Saturday at a campsite on remote Ham Lake. No injuries have been reported. In Maryland, a fast-moving fire, whipped by high winds, consumed a large warehouse on the Eastern Shore that served as a food processing plant during both world wars.

Flooding; Parts of River Crest Farmer: Flood 'Very Financially Strapping' More Mo. Flooding; Parts of River Crest Evacuations, Sandbagging in Missouri Buy AP Photo Reprints KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Levee breaks along the Missouri River flooded farms, highways and railroad tracks, and left dozens of homes surrounded by water, as the flooding that has inundated the region was expected to peak in some spots this weekend. Near-record flood levels dropped in parts of Missouri, but rose in northwest and central parts of the state, as worried residents removed valuables from their homes and filled sandbags to protect river communities. A runaway barge on the Missouri River slowed about 25 miles away from the Jefferson City, officials said. A state transportation engineer said a tugboat was on the way to recover the barge before it could reach the capital. Inmates from St. Joseph prison and National Guard members filled sandbags to try to protect a water treatment plant, schools and an ethanol plant near Craig, where the Missouri River dropped a few inches Thursday. The water got within "a hillbilly's whisker from going over in several places," Holt County Sheriff Kirby Felumb said Thursday. Rivers breached or topped dozens of levees across the state, officials said. No serious injuries or deaths had been reported in the flooding, said Brian Hauswirth, a spokesman for the State Emergency Management Agency. Thunderstorms raised rivers and generated tornadoes that claimed 12 lives in Kansas. The most recent levee break occurred Thursday afternoon between the towns of DeWitt and Brunswick, flooding farmland, slowing traffic on U.S. 24 and damaging railroad tracks. Another Carroll County breach south of Norborne had flooded about 15,000 acres of cropland and left about 75 rural homes surrounded with Missouri River water. Big Lake, in Holt County in northwestern Missouri, suffered some of the worst damage in flooding Monday night and Tuesday, after several area levees were breached. Most of the 32 rescues the Missouri State Water Patrol has conducted since flooding began have been in the Big Lake area. By Thursday, rooftops were still all that could be seen of some of the 450 to 475 homes flooded in Big Lake. Authorities spent Thursday taking some residents to rescue their pets and retrieve medication. "We can't do much for the property," Felumb said. "There's no need to let a family pet die if we have resources." Statewide, the flooding has led to the evacuation of several hundred people, including some residents of Levasy and the Ray County town of Hardin, where the 1993 flood surge toppled headstones and unearthed hundreds of caskets. In Levasy, a breached levee left at least 15 homes with up to 8 feet of water in them, said Deputy Ronda Montgomery, a spokeswoman for the Jackson County Sheriff's Department. State officials said two other communities - Rushville and Napoleon - were within 500 feet of levees that were broken or had been topped. But the damage was less extensive, Hauswirth said. Although the river crests were lower than forecast in many areas, residents remained anxious. Many were here for the 1993 floods, among the most costly in U.S. history. The rain-swollen rivers and streams that make up the Missouri River system are causing damage in different spots as the water makes its way eastward toward St. Louis, where the Missouri River meets the Mississippi, said Suzanne Fortin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. In Jefferson City, the Missouri River was expected to crest Sunday at 8.7 feet above flood stage, which could cause flooding at the municipal airport and other low-lying areas below the bluff where the state Capitol sits. During a briefing at the State Emergency Operations Center, Gov. Matt Blunt said joint state and federal damage assessment teams were being dispatched to 17 counties, and about 100 Missouri National Guard members had been deployed around the state. He said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has prepared about 1.2 million sandbags, about 132,000 of which already had been distributed to help fight the flood by Wednesday. Torrential rain Thursday caused flash floods in parts of southern Missouri, closing some roads. Near Gravois Mills, in Morgan County just northwest of the Lake of the Ozarks, authorities said the normally empty Little Proctor Creek filled with 4 to 6 feet of water in 20 minutes. East of Jefferson City, the Missouri State Water Patrol closed a stretch of the swollen Osage River to boaters.

(AP) -- A runaway trailer started a chain-reaction crash on the Chesapeake Bay bridge, killing three people and injuring five others as dozens of vehicles swerved to avoid it, authorities said. As crumpled trucks were hauled away Thursday evening, structural engineers examined the bridge by boat, air and foot and it was found to be structurally sound and safe, said Marcus Brown, chief of the Maryland Transportation Authority Police. Friday morning, all lanes were open again. The bridge, officially known as the William Preston Lane Jr. Memorial Bridge, is the main artery connecting Maryland's Eastern Shore with the rest of the state. With the westbound lanes closed all night, stores on the eastern side were busy. "They can't get across the bridge to go home so they're just hanging out until the bridge opens up. It's good for business, but it's not good for me here all alone," said Melodie Shreve, who was working by herself at the Shore Stop in Stevensville. The Best Western in Grasonville, a few miles from the bridge, sold out by 8 p.m. Melissa Hess, the front desk supervisor, said some guests who had suites even gave up their second room to help stranded motorists. The crash started when a small flatbed trailer being pulled by an SUV came unattached shortly after 4 p.m. at the start of the bridge's westbound span. In all, seven vehicles crashed, including a tanker hauling animal fat and a tow truck. "Other vehicles that were following swerved to avoid a trailer and that's what started this collision," said police Cpl. Jonathan Green. He described it as an "unbelievable crash scene" with vehicles pinned against each other and the railings, but said none went off the bridge. Brown said it was too early in the investigation to say whether charges would be filed. One person was flown to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with life-threatening injuries; four others had less serious injuries, Brown said. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BABY_NAMES_KATRINA?SITE=NJMOR&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	Daily Record - Nation & World Subscribe to our Daily Report newsletter May 11, 11:03 AM EDT Katrina Dips in Popularity As Baby Name Buy AP Photo Reprints Memo sent regarding the defective levee pumps Day at the Depot: Store Becomes Community Hub AP Analysis: Katrina Insurance Katrina Insurance: The Survivors WASHINGTON (AP) -- As baby names go, Katrina isn't in vogue these days. But she isn't persona non grata, either. From its peak in the 1980s - when it regularly ranked among the 100 most popular names that parents chose for their daughters - it had gradually slumped to 247th by 2005, even before Hurricane Katrina smashed the Gulf Coast in late summer of that year. The name's association with the catastrophe has now knocked it out of consideration for most parents, sinking its popularity to the lowest ebb since the 1950s. Only about 850 baby girls in the United States were named Katrina last year, according to new data released Friday by the Social Security Administration, dropping it more than 100 slots on the popularity list. At a rank of 382nd, it now sits just below Brenna. Ironically, the two states that suffered most of Katrina's wrath bucked the trend, if only in small numbers. In Louisiana, the number of babies named Katrina jumped from eight in the 12 months before the storm to 15 in the 12 months after, according to state health officials. In Mississippi, seven babies were given the name from 2004 until the storm hit in August 2005, according to state data. The number climbed to 24 from September 2005 through the end of 2006. Overall, the country's most popular names list hasn't changed much since 2005. Emily and Jacob remain atop the list. Emily has been the top girls' name since 1996; Jacob for boys since 1999. The national trend surprised Cleveland Evans, a psychology professor and names expert at Bellevue University in Nebraska. But he said Katrina isn't likely to go extinct. "This is not going to be a name like Adolf that's going to disappear and be unusable ever again," he said, referring to that name's association with Adolf Hitler. Scarlett and Stephen Billis, a Los Angeles-area couple who named their daughter Katrina last May. Scarlett said the couple was reluctant to use the name less than a year after the hurricane, but her husband had always liked it as a variation of Katherine, a family name. Also, their family is Greek and the name is close to the popular Greek name Katerina. "People ask if we named her after the hurricane," Billis said. "We didn't pick it because of that and we were actually hesitant ... but we do joke that our house looks like a hurricane hit." The Social Security Administration's rankings, released each year just before Mother's Day, are based on some 4.2 million Social Security card applications from 2006. Social Security began compiling the name lists in 1997. The agency offers lists of baby names for each year since 1880 on its Web site: &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
