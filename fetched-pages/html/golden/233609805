The study, published by nine doctors including the medical officer monitoring city firefighters, Dr. David Prezant, found that firefighters and rescue workers contracted sarcoidosis in the year after Sept. 11, 2001, at a rate more than five times higher than the years before the attacks. Unlike previous studies that have linked exposure to the toxic dust cloud that enveloped lower Manhattan after the World Trade Center's collapse to many different respiratory illnesses, this study zeros in on one disease. Sarcoidosis, which can be life-threatening, causes an inflammation in the lungs that deposits tiny cells in the organs, leaving scar tissues that damage them. Several rescue workers and others exposed to trade center dust have claimed they contracted the disease from their work at ground zero. The study compared the rates of contracting sarcoidosis among fire department employees for 15 years before Sept. 11 and for five years after it. It said firefighters who showed symptoms of the disease on chest X-rays underwent more intensive exams. After the trade center attack, 26 firefighters were diagnosed with sarcoidosis, the study found. Thirteen were diagnosed in the first year after the attacks, which represents a rate of 86 per 100,000. In the 15 years before the attack, the rate of sarcoidosis was 15 per 100,0000, the study found. None of the 26 rescue workers, who are in their 30s and 40s, has died of the disease, and about 10 have improved or recovered since their diagnoses, the study found. Two of the firefighters were former smokers, the study found. The study was published this week in the May issue of CHEST Physician, a journal published by the American College of Chest Physicians.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7393916.html	Farmed fish fed contaminated material linked to pet food recall | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Farmed fish fed contaminated material linked to pet food recall Story Published: May 8, 2007 at 11:53 AM PDT Story Updated: May 8, 2007 at 11:53 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - Farmed fish were fed meal spiked with an industrial chemical linked to the ongoing recall of pet foods, though the contamination level was probably too low to pose a danger to anyone who may have eaten the fish, federal health officials said Tuesday. The Canadian-made meal included what was purported to be wheat gluten, a protein source, imported from China. The material was actually wheat flour spiked by the chemical melamine and related, nitrogen-rich compounds to make it appear more protein rich than it was, officials said. After pigs and chickens, the farmed fish mark the third food animal given contaminated feed. The level of contamination is expected to be too low to pose any danger to human health, said Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's assistant commissioner for food protection. It wasn't immediately clear if any of the farmed fish entered the food supply. However, Acheson said at least one firm's fish were still too young and small to be sold. Investigators were visiting other U.S. aquaculture farms that used the contaminated feed. Melamine, a chemical found in plastics and pesticides and not approved for use in pet or human in the U.S., contaminated pet food that either sickened or killed an unknown number of dogs and cats. Since March 16, more than 100 brands of pet food have been recalled because they were contaminated with melamine. Acheson said that fish samples would be screened for signs of melamine. "Depending upon what we find in that testing, that is going to drive the next steps," Acheson said. Canadian officials are aware of the finding, Acheson said. "We used it to make pet food. They used it to make fish meal," he told reporters. Federal health and food officials have said some 20 million chickens and thousands of hogs also were fed feed contaminated by melamine. As with the fish, they said the risk to human health is very low. U.S. investigators also have learned that the purported Chinese wheat gluten and a second ingredient, rice protein concentrate, were actually simple wheat flour. The flour was spiked with melamine and related, nitrogen-rich compounds to make it appear more protein rich than it was. In tests, nitrogen levels are measured to gauge the overall protein content of food ingredients. "What we discovered is these are not wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate but in fact are wheat flour contaminated by melamine," Acheson said. The FDA is considering enforcement options, he added. The ingredients came from two Chinese firms: Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co. and Futian Biology Technology Co. Ltd.

(AP) - Drug maker Purdue Pharma L.P. agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia over its promotion of the powerful painkiller OxyContin, especially to doctors, the company said Tuesday. The states had complained that Purdue had been encouraging physicians to prescribe the drugs for use every eight hours, instead of the every 12-hour dose approved by the Food and Drug Administration. "We're raising the bar on off-label marketing and other promotion tactics that lead to abuse and diversion of prescription drugs," Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said. "Our combined state legal campaign will stop this manufacturer from promote a powerful drug for inappropriate uses. OxyContin offers huge benefits as a highly potent painkiller, but also horrendous risks if abused or diverted." Among other things, the settlement requires Purdue to abide by the warning on its packaging insert, stop marketing the drug for use in ways other than approved by the FDA, and maintain an internal abuse diversion detection program. "It has always been Purdue's written policy that promotion of its products must adhere to FDA-approved prescribing information for those products as well as applicable laws," the company said in a statement. "The company maintains a comprehensive compliance program to ensure its employees and operations comply with its internal policies and all applicable laws and requirements, including the provisions of the agreements announced today." Other states taking part in the settlement are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7393906.html	VA urged to improve testing, compensation for veterans with stress disorder | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health VA urged to improve testing, compensation for veterans with stress disorder Story Published: May 8, 2007 at 11:53 AM PDT Story Updated: May 8, 2007 at 11:53 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - The surge in the number of veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder requires development of better tests to evaluate affected personnel and determine how best to compensate them, a panel of medical experts said Tuesday. "As the increasing number of claims to the VA shows, PTSD has become a very significant public health problem," said Nancy Andreasen, chair of the committee that prepared the report. "Our review of the current methods for evaluating PTSD disability claims and determining compensation indicates that a comprehensive revision is needed," said Andreasen, head of the psychiatry department at Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa. Claims increased from 120,265 in 1999 to 215,871 in 2004 and payments jumped from $1.72 billion to $4.28 billion in the same period, a combined committee from the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council said. "VA is studying the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report to determine actions that can be taken to further enhance the services we provide," VA press secretary Matt Burns said. "VA is a recognized leader in the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD, and we will continue to take steps to ensure veterans have timely and seamless access to compensation for which they are eligible," he added. While the largest share of claims is still coming from Vietnam War veterans, there are expected to be many more claims in future from personnel who served in the first Gulf War and in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the panel said. But the Veterans Affairs Department uses only crude criteria for rating disabilities due to mental illness and is not consistent for relapsing conditions, according to the report, which had been requested by the VA. The panel urged the VA to develop new criteria based on the diagnostic standards of the American Psychiatric Association and to establish certification programs for workers who deal with PTSD claims. The panel said the VA should base compensation decisions on how greatly PTSD affects all aspects of a veteran's daily life, not just his or her ability to be gainfully employed. Andreasen noted that in the case of a paraplegic, compensation is based on both ability to work and quality of life, while in the case of mental illness, currently the ratings are tightly linked to the ability to be employed. The report also noted that PTSD can be triggered by trauma other than combat, such as sexual assault. Female veterans are less likely to receive compensation for PTSD, which may in part be due to the difficulty of substantiating exposure to traumatic events unrelated to combat, including sexual harassment or assaults that occurred during service, the report said. It urged the VA to gather data and provide reference materials to help disability raters better address the management of PTSD claims related to sexual assault during military service. Dr. Robert J. Ursano, chairman of the department of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., a member of the committee, said the recommendations are complex and the VA will have to study how to implement them over time. The Institute of Medicine and National Research Council are branches of the National Academy of Sciences, an independent organization chartered by Congress to advise the government on scientific matters.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7382521.html	Millions of dollars intended for poor probably stayed with insurers, investigators say | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Millions of dollars intended for poor probably stayed with insurers, investigators say Story Published: May 7, 2007 at 9:05 PM PDT Story Updated: May 7, 2007 at 6:20 PM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - Some of the aid intended for the poorest of Medicare's participants - tens of millions of dollars - probably never made it to them during the first year of the new Medicare drug benefit. Some so-called dual-eligibles - seniors and disabled people whose incomes are so low that they also qualify for Medicaid - were never told that they could seek reimbursement for some drug-related expenses, federal investigators say in a report to be released Tuesday. The Bush administration took extra precautions to help the group. It said that the government should cover the cost of medicine for dual-eligibles retroactively - back to the first day of the month when the beneficiary became eligible for Medicaid. The federal government pays the insurers for that retroactive coverage - about $100 million in 2006. Then, the plans are required to reimburse their dual-eligible customers for drug costs incurred during those months when they were eligible for extra help but not yet in their new plan. "Given the vulnerability of the dual-eligible population, it seems unlikely that the majority of these beneficiaries would have contacted their (insurance plan) for reimbursement if they were not notified of their right to do so," the Government Accountability Office said. The agency that oversees the drug benefit, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, recently revised the letter it uses to notify dual-eligibles they've been enrolled in a drug plan. The letter now lets beneficiaries know they may be eligible for reimbursement of previous expenses. Medicare officials said the challenges associated with moving more than 6 million dual-eligibles into the new drug benefit were immense. In that context, the report's recommendations constitute minor refinements for the program, which cost the federal government about $30 billion last year. "We must object to the overwhelmingly negative tone of the findings set forth in this report," said Leslie Norwalk, acting administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. "We believe that an evenhanded report would begin by prominently acknowledging the overall success of CMS' efforts." Norwalk took issue with the investigators' conclusion that CMS put the Medicare program at risk of paying insurers for several months when they are not providing drug benefits. She said the conclusion was unsubstantiated. Indeed, the agency has educated partners that insurers have an obligation to reimburse their customers or other payers for costs that customers incurred during the retroactive period. But senators seemed to side with the investigators. "I'm very disturbed that CMS paid out about $100 million to plans to pay claims for dual eligibles, yet CMS can't say if the plans lived up to their obligations," said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. "Apparently, both the beneficiaries and the government were shortchanged." Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., said the report indicates serious gaps in the information that low-income enrollees are given and the financial help they receive. Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., said the report sheds light on "yet another example of how private plans are being grossly overpaid for services they have not provided." But Karen Ignagni, president and CEO of a trade group representing the insurance industry, said the insurers know about the requirements for reimbursing beneficiaries for retroactive drug expenses, and they are strongly committed to doing so. "There is no confusion within the health plan community about that responsibility," she said. At times, there have been problems with government databases that can cause delays in reimbursement by insurers, she said. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7441506.html	FDA approves patch to treat early Parkinson's symptoms | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health FDA approves patch to treat early Parkinson's symptoms Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 9:00 AM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 9:00 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - The treatment options for patients with early Parkinson's expanded Wednesday with the approval of a new drug in patch form - a first for medicines to treat symptoms of the disease. The once-daily Neupro patch contains a drug called rotigotine, which has not been sold before in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration said. The drug patch, made by Schwarz Pharma AG, is the first for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease results from the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. Dopamine is crucial for the communication between cells that control muscle movement, which explains the trembling commonly seen in Parkinson's patients. Rotigotine works by activating dopamine receptors in the brain, mimicking the neurotransmitter's effect. The most common side effects for Neupro include skin reactions at the patch site, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and insomnia, the FDA said. Most are typical with this class of drugs. Other potential safety concerns include sudden onset of sleep while engaged in activities such as driving or operating machinery, hallucinations and decreased blood pressure when standing up, the agency said. An estimated 1 million people in the U.S. have Parkinson's, with an additional 60,000 cases diagnosed each year. Belgium's UCB bought Germany-based Schwarz Pharma last year.

(AP) - The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin and three of its current and former executives pleaded guilty Thursday to misleading the public about the drug's risk of addiction, a federal prosecutor and the company said. Purdue Pharma L.P., its president, top lawyer and former chief medical officer will pay $634.5 million in fines for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications, U.S. Attorney John Brownlee said in a news release. The plea comes two days after the Stamford, Conn.-based company agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia to settle complaints that it encouraged physicians to overprescribe OxyContin. "With its OxyContin, Purdue unleashed a highly abusable, addictive, and potentially dangerous drug on an unsuspecting and unknowing public," Brownlee said. "For these misrepresentations and crimes, Purdue and its executives have been brought to justice." Privately held Purdue Pharma said it accepted responsibility for its employees' actions. "During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again," the company said in a news release. OxyContin, a trade name for oxycodone, is a time-release painkiller that can be highly addictive. Designed to be swallowed whole and digested over 12 hours, the pills can produce a heroin-like high if crushed and then swallowed, snorted or injected. From 1996 to 2001, the number of oxycodone-related deaths nationwide increased 400 percent while the annual number of OxyContin prescriptions increased nearly 20-fold, according to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2002, the DEA said the drug caused 146 deaths and contributed to another 318. In western Virginia, 228 people died from overdoses of oxycodone from 1996 to 2005, Brownlee said. The fines will be distributed to state and federal law enforcement agencies, the federal government, federal and state Medicaid programs, a Virginia prescription monitoring program and individuals who had sued the company.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7374701.html	Study suggests coping strategies for childhood immunizations | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Study suggests coping strategies for childhood immunizations Story Published: May 7, 2007 at 10:59 AM PDT Story Updated: May 7, 2007 at 10:59 AM PDT CHICAGO (AP) - Some children sob, others scream, and some get so upset they have to be restrained by medical staff. But a new study suggests parents can ease the anxiety about immunizations by telling a joke, reading a book or bringing a favorite toy from home. Other proven distraction techniques include blowing soap bubbles and, for babies under six months, using a pacifier dipped in sugar water. "All of those kinds of things can take children's minds away from the needle poised to go into their arm," said lead author Dr. Neil L. Schechter, the director of the Pain Relief Program at Connecticut Children's Medical Center. The study appears in the May edition of Pediatrics, scheduled for release Monday. Parents who are overly apologetic or excessively reassuring during the procedure can actually cause more distress, the research found. Instead, parents should adopt a "matter-of-fact, supportive, nonapologetic approach," researchers said. The 2007 immunization schedule from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends 10 vaccines for children under the age of 6, with most requiring multiple doses. Schechter's team reviewed hundreds of previous studies regarding pediatric immunizations and referenced about 120 in their article, in which they also make recommendations for doctors. While some may dismiss the shots as a rite of passage, children's fear can interfere with important discussions pediatricians need to have with parents, said Schechter, who is also a professor of pediatrics at the University of Connecticut School of Medicine and a pediatrician at Hartford's St. Francis Hospital. At Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, child life specialist Emily Rogers helps young patients deal with procedures including injections and getting their blood drawn. Rogers said she believed the study was a valuable one. While somewhat surprised with findings that overly empathetic parents can cause more distress, she theorized it's because children became scared and confused when they feel their parents lack control over a situation. She carries a "distraction bag" packed with pinwheels, bubbles, whistles and books, and she also helps young patients practice relaxation and breathing techniques. Rogers said it's important parents not bargain with their child, instead emphasizing while it's OK to feel scared, the medical procedure is designed to help them and the child isn't being punished. "I think kids are pretty smart. They know how to drag something out," Rogers said. "Parents need to emphasize this is something we need to get done." That's how Gina Rubel of Doylestown, Pa., approaches shots with her 4-year-old son, Ford, who received three injections last month. Rubel, who owns a public relations firm, said she and her husband emphasize to Ford and their 7-year-old daughter that the shots "are part of the growing up process, part of staying healthy and taking care of yourself." Still, Rubel remembers as a child kicking her pediatrician in the shins and hiding under a table before an immunization. And during his most recent shots, her son cried and afterward dramatically walked with a limp, complaining of how much the shots hurt. She gave him a hug, then quickly tried to change the focus. "It's very hard for me not to cry when you see your child feeling pain," she said. "I don't know any parent who doesn't get upset." Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

The anti-retroviral drugs are needed by patients who develop resistance to first-line treatment and currently cost 10 times as much as first-line therapy, Clinton said. Nearly half a million patients will require these drugs by 2010. Clinton's foundation negotiated agreements with generic drug makers Cipla Ltd. and Matrix Laboratories Ltd. that he said would mean an average savings of 25 percent in low-income countries and 50 percent in middle-income countries. He said the companies collaborated with the foundation to lower production costs, in part by securing lower prices for raw materials. The reduced-price, once-daily pill combines the drugs tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz. Clinton said the new price of $339 per patient per year would be 45 percent lower than the current rate available to low-income countries and 67 percent less than the price available to many middle-income countries "Seven million people in the developing world are in need of treatment for HIV/AIDS," Clinton said. "We are trying to meet that need with the best medicine available today, and at prices that low and middle-income countries can afford." The Clinton Foundation's activities are being financed by UNITAID, an organization formed by France and 19 other nations that have earmarked a small portion of their airline tax revenues for HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries. UNITAID will provide the foundation with more than $100 million to buy second-line medicines for 27 countries through 2008. "Every person living with HIV deserves access to the most effective medicines, and UNITAID aims to ensure that these are affordable for all developing countries," French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy, chairman of UNITAID's board, said in a statement. Since starting its HIV/AIDS Initiative in 2002, the Clinton Foundation has worked with 25 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia to set up AIDS treatment and prevention programs. The foundation also provides access to lower-priced AIDS drugs in 65 countries. Some 750,000 people are now receiving AIDS drugs purchased through the Clinton Foundation.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7418606.html	Dentists say children's dental health has not improved | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Dentists say children's dental health has not improved Story Published: May 9, 2007 at 9:06 AM PDT Story Updated: May 9, 2007 at 9:06 AM PDT BEND, Ore. (AP) - Dental health may not be getting any worse for Oregon children, but dentists say they see few signs that it is improving. "I've seen a lot of it for a long time," said Dr. Cate Quas, a pediatric dentist in Bend who treats many Oregon Health Plan patients. "I see horrendous stuff in preschoolers." Quas said she recently pulled 10 of a little boy's 20 teeth because the decay was so extensive. She said the boy told her he looked like an old man so she made him a retainer with prosthetic teeth. "What happens is that families, they let the problem get too bad because they don't know where to go and they can't afford it. Of course it just snowballs and they end up with a toothache or an infection," said Vickie Matthews, coordinator of the Kemple Children's Clinic, which coordinates dental care for low-income children in Central Oregon. "We have had some kids here with life-threatening infections," Matthews said. According to a report released in November by the Oregon Department of Human Services, 56 percent of children ages 6 to 8 in Oregon have had dental caries, which is tooth decay that can lead to cavities. Nationwide, 50 percent of children in the same age group have experienced dental caries, although the overall prevalence of tooth decay in older children is decreasing. "Oregon has an oral disease burden. It's a silent epidemic," said Brett Hamilton, managing director of public and professional education for the Oregon Dental Association. "A lot of times people don't associate their mouth with their whole body or realize that their mouth is part of their overall health." Quas blames too much milk or sugary drinks for much of the problem. "The stuff you see in preschoolers is generally created when they are toddlers," she said. "It's not like between the ages of 2 and 5 the tooth decay becomes rampant." Some parents give their children juice in sippy cups and let them carry the sugary drink around all day, or put them to bed with milk in their bottles, Quas said. Sugars in the fluids coat the teeth, giving bacteria a chance to take hold. "The food pools on top of the teeth and the bacteria have a heyday," Quas said. "They have little parties all night long and eat into the teeth." Instead, Quas and other dentists recommend giving children water in sippy cups or bottles instead of drinks that are high in sugar. Often parents also don't realize that recommendations on dental care have changed, said Dr. Mike Shirtcliff, president and CEO of Northwest Dental Services in Redmond. The group of almost 300 Oregon dentists works to improve access to basic dental care in rural areas of the state. "The mythology in dentistry is you don't treat pregnant women unless it is an emergency and you don't treat kids until they are 30 months old," Shirtcliff said. But now the professional standard is to treat pregnant women, and babies should be seen before their first birthday. "We've been working hard to change the standard of care. It's going from old knowledge to new knowledge." Shirtcliff's organization works to educate and encourage dentists to treat more patients with Oregon Health Plan coverage. Because the Oregon Health Plan does not reimburse at as high a rate as other types of insurance, he said, sometimes dentists are reluctant to participate. In Central Oregon there are plenty of pediatric dentists, Shirtcliff said. But places like Douglas County, the Southern Oregon coast and areas of Eastern Oregon have a limited number of pediatric dentists to serve the population. Dentists also recommend fluoridation of drinking water to prevent decay. The Oregon Dental Association has been pushing the state Legislature for years to mandate that Oregon's drinking water be fluoridated, Hamilton said. "There seems to be more and more decay," said Dr. Dean Nyquist, a Bend dentist who sees many young children with serious dental problems. "Especially in our area where we do not have fluoride in the water. It makes a big difference." Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7419176.html	Study links lung scarring disease to post-Sept. 11 WTC work | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Study links lung scarring disease to post-Sept. 11 WTC work Story Published: May 9, 2007 at 9:38 AM PDT Story Updated: May 9, 2007 at 9:38 AM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - Rescue workers and firefighters contracted a serious lung-scarring disease called sarcoidosis at a much higher rate after the Sept. 11 attacks than before, said a study that is the first to link the disease to exposure to toxic dust at ground zero. The study, published by nine doctors including the medical officer monitoring city firefighters, Dr. David Prezant, found that firefighters and rescue workers contracted sarcoidosis in the year after Sept. 11, 2001, at a rate more than five times higher than the years before the attacks. Unlike previous studies that have linked exposure to the toxic dust cloud that enveloped lower Manhattan after the World Trade Center's collapse to many different respiratory illnesses, this study zeros in on one disease. Sarcoidosis, which can be life-threatening, causes an inflammation in the lungs that deposits tiny cells in the organs, leaving scar tissues that damage them. Several rescue workers and others exposed to trade center dust have claimed they contracted the disease from their work at ground zero. The study compared the rates of contracting sarcoidosis among fire department employees for 15 years before Sept. 11 and for five years after it. It said firefighters who showed symptoms of the disease on chest X-rays underwent more intensive exams. After the trade center attack, 26 firefighters were diagnosed with sarcoidosis, the study found. Thirteen were diagnosed in the first year after the attacks, which represents a rate of 86 per 100,000. In the 15 years before the attack, the rate of sarcoidosis was 15 per 100,0000, the study found. None of the 26 rescue workers, who are in their 30s and 40s, has died of the disease, and about 10 have improved or recovered since their diagnoses, the study found. Two of the firefighters were former smokers, the study found. The study was published this week in the May issue of CHEST Physician, a journal published by the American College of Chest Physicians.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7464652.html	Lose the ads, not the weight, says doctors' group | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Lose the ads, not the weight, says doctors' group Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 11:58 AM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 11:58 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - An ad campaign that suggested milk can help people lose weight is ending, the Federal Trade Commission told a doctors' group that had complained. The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine contended the weight loss claims were false and misleading. The group, in a 2005 petition, asked the commission to order a halt to the dairy advertisements. The agency did not take that step, but said in a letter to the committee that the groups behind the ads planned to end them. "It is obvious that the industry did not have a leg to stand on," Neal Barnard, president of the Washington-based doctors committee, said Thursday. His group advocates a vegan diet, which typically includes no animal products. The two marketing campaigns at issue involve the "Milk your diet. Lose Weight!" ads on television, Internet and in magazines, and the "3-A-Day. Burn More Fat, Lose Weight" ads, which are now mostly Web-based. The FTC, in a letter May 3 to the committee, said the agency met with Agriculture Department officials and representatives for the two campaigns, which decided "to discontinue all advertising and other marketing activities involving weight loss claims until further research provides stronger, more conclusive evidence." Susan Ruland, a spokeswoman for the "Milk your Diet" campaign, said there was nothing misleading about the ads. "We absolutely stand behind our weight loss campaign and the science supporting our messages," said Ruland, who represents the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board. "There's a strong body of scientific evidence that demonstrates a connection between dairy and weight loss." Still, she said, the board plans to phase out the milk ads and focus the campaign instead on how dairy can help promote a healthy diet. The National Dairy Promotion and Research Board said it has already changed its "3-A-Day" campaign. The Agriculture Department, which has oversight of the two boards, had approved the ads. A spokesman said the agency supports the decision to pull back from the campaigns. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7464627.html	Merck vaccine production problem means extra shot for kids | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Merck vaccine production problem means extra shot for kids Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 11:56 AM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 11:56 AM PDT TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Young children needing immunization against chickenpox and three other diseases likely will have to get an extra shot, due to manufacturing problems that have halted production of a four-disease combo vaccine made by Merck & Co. Merck said Thursday that its ProQuad vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella as well as chickenpox, won't be available from about July until at least year's end. "It's too early to say at this point whether new (ProQuad) supplies will be available in 2008," said Mary Elizabeth Blake, spokeswoman for Merck's vaccines division. However, the drugmaker expects to have plenty of two separate vaccines that cover the same diseases: Varivax, for chickenpox, and M-M-R II, for measles, mumps and rubella. The federal government recommends children get each of those shots twice, once at age 12 months to 15 months and again between ages four and six years old, or - when available - they can receive the ProQuad vaccine twice. Last year, the government recommended the second chickenpox shot because of outbreaks among schoolchildren, apparently due to waning potency of the vaccine. Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck is the only U.S. source for vaccines against the varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox in children and shingles in adults. Blake said Merck decided to shift available supply of the key vaccine ingredient against chickenpox - live but weakened varicella virus - from ProQuad to Varivax and its shingles vaccine, Zostavax. The drugmaker recently informed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of its decision. "It makes sense to cut back on ProQuad first" because that requires more virus, said Dr. Lance Rodewald, director of the CDC's immunization services division. He said the agency had been assured there would be an adequate supply of both Varivax, with an expected demand of more than 8 million doses, and Merck's Zostavax vaccine against shingles. Zostavax was just approved last May and is recommended for all adults aged 60 and older. Shingles, also called herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash that strikes roughly one in four adults who previously had chickenpox. The government does not have a firm projection of demand for Zostavax, Rodewald said. According to the CDC, Merck charges private doctors about $45 for M-M-R II and $75 for Varivax, slightly less than the $125 price for ProQuad. All or most of the cost of getting the shots is generally covered by private insurance and the federal Vaccines for Children program for the poor. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Merck shares fell 97 cents to $51.08, near their 52-week high of $52.63. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

(AP) - Drug maker Purdue Pharma L.P. agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia over its promotion of the powerful painkiller OxyContin, especially to doctors, the company said Tuesday. The states had complained that Purdue had been encouraging physicians to prescribe the drugs for use every eight hours, instead of the every 12-hour dose approved by the Food and Drug Administration. "We're raising the bar on off-label marketing and other promotion tactics that lead to abuse and diversion of prescription drugs," Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said. "Our combined state legal campaign will stop this manufacturer from promote a powerful drug for inappropriate uses. OxyContin offers huge benefits as a highly potent painkiller, but also horrendous risks if abused or diverted." Among other things, the settlement requires Purdue to abide by the warning on its packaging insert, stop marketing the drug for use in ways other than approved by the FDA, and maintain an internal abuse diversion detection program. "It has always been Purdue's written policy that promotion of its products must adhere to FDA-approved prescribing information for those products as well as applicable laws," the company said in a statement. "The company maintains a comprehensive compliance program to ensure its employees and operations comply with its internal policies and all applicable laws and requirements, including the provisions of the agreements announced today." Other states taking part in the settlement are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7393906.html	VA urged to improve testing, compensation for veterans with stress disorder | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health VA urged to improve testing, compensation for veterans with stress disorder Story Published: May 8, 2007 at 11:53 AM PDT Story Updated: May 8, 2007 at 11:53 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - The surge in the number of veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder requires development of better tests to evaluate affected personnel and determine how best to compensate them, a panel of medical experts said Tuesday. "As the increasing number of claims to the VA shows, PTSD has become a very significant public health problem," said Nancy Andreasen, chair of the committee that prepared the report. "Our review of the current methods for evaluating PTSD disability claims and determining compensation indicates that a comprehensive revision is needed," said Andreasen, head of the psychiatry department at Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa. Claims increased from 120,265 in 1999 to 215,871 in 2004 and payments jumped from $1.72 billion to $4.28 billion in the same period, a combined committee from the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council said. "VA is studying the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report to determine actions that can be taken to further enhance the services we provide," VA press secretary Matt Burns said. "VA is a recognized leader in the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD, and we will continue to take steps to ensure veterans have timely and seamless access to compensation for which they are eligible," he added. While the largest share of claims is still coming from Vietnam War veterans, there are expected to be many more claims in future from personnel who served in the first Gulf War and in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the panel said. But the Veterans Affairs Department uses only crude criteria for rating disabilities due to mental illness and is not consistent for relapsing conditions, according to the report, which had been requested by the VA. The panel urged the VA to develop new criteria based on the diagnostic standards of the American Psychiatric Association and to establish certification programs for workers who deal with PTSD claims. The panel said the VA should base compensation decisions on how greatly PTSD affects all aspects of a veteran's daily life, not just his or her ability to be gainfully employed. Andreasen noted that in the case of a paraplegic, compensation is based on both ability to work and quality of life, while in the case of mental illness, currently the ratings are tightly linked to the ability to be employed. The report also noted that PTSD can be triggered by trauma other than combat, such as sexual assault. Female veterans are less likely to receive compensation for PTSD, which may in part be due to the difficulty of substantiating exposure to traumatic events unrelated to combat, including sexual harassment or assaults that occurred during service, the report said. It urged the VA to gather data and provide reference materials to help disability raters better address the management of PTSD claims related to sexual assault during military service. Dr. Robert J. Ursano, chairman of the department of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., a member of the committee, said the recommendations are complex and the VA will have to study how to implement them over time. The Institute of Medicine and National Research Council are branches of the National Academy of Sciences, an independent organization chartered by Congress to advise the government on scientific matters.

The once-daily Neupro patch contains a drug called rotigotine, which has not been sold before in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration said. The drug patch, made by Schwarz Pharma AG, is the first for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease results from the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. Dopamine is crucial for the communication between cells that control muscle movement, which explains the trembling commonly seen in Parkinson's patients. Rotigotine works by activating dopamine receptors in the brain, mimicking the neurotransmitter's effect. The most common side effects for Neupro include skin reactions at the patch site, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and insomnia, the FDA said. Most are typical with this class of drugs. Other potential safety concerns include sudden onset of sleep while engaged in activities such as driving or operating machinery, hallucinations and decreased blood pressure when standing up, the agency said. An estimated 1 million people in the U.S. have Parkinson's, with an additional 60,000 cases diagnosed each year. Belgium's UCB bought Germany-based Schwarz Pharma last year.

The plea comes two days after the Stamford, Conn.-based company agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia to settle complaints that it encouraged physicians to overprescribe OxyContin. "With its OxyContin, Purdue unleashed a highly abusable, addictive, and potentially dangerous drug on an unsuspecting and unknowing public," Brownlee said. "For these misrepresentations and crimes, Purdue and its executives have been brought to justice." Privately held Purdue Pharma said it accepted responsibility for its employees' actions. "During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again," the company said in a news release. OxyContin, a trade name for oxycodone, is a time-release painkiller that can be highly addictive. Designed to be swallowed whole and digested over 12 hours, the pills can produce a heroin-like high if crushed and then swallowed, snorted or injected. From 1996 to 2001, the number of oxycodone-related deaths nationwide increased 400 percent while the annual number of OxyContin prescriptions increased nearly 20-fold, according to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2002, the DEA said the drug caused 146 deaths and contributed to another 318. In western Virginia, 228 people died from overdoses of oxycodone from 1996 to 2005, Brownlee said. The fines will be distributed to state and federal law enforcement agencies, the federal government, federal and state Medicaid programs, a Virginia prescription monitoring program and individuals who had sued the company.

The Canadian-made meal included what was purported to be wheat gluten, a protein source, imported from China. The material was actually wheat flour spiked by the chemical melamine and related, nitrogen-rich compounds to make it appear more protein rich than it was, officials said. After pigs and chickens, the farmed fish mark the third food animal given contaminated feed. The level of contamination is expected to be too low to pose any danger to human health, said Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's assistant commissioner for food protection. It wasn't immediately clear if any of the farmed fish entered the food supply. However, Acheson said at least one firm's fish were still too young and small to be sold. Investigators were visiting other U.S. aquaculture farms that used the contaminated feed. Melamine, a chemical found in plastics and pesticides and not approved for use in pet or human in the U.S., contaminated pet food that either sickened or killed an unknown number of dogs and cats. Since March 16, more than 100 brands of pet food have been recalled because they were contaminated with melamine. Acheson said that fish samples would be screened for signs of melamine. "Depending upon what we find in that testing, that is going to drive the next steps," Acheson said. Canadian officials are aware of the finding, Acheson said. "We used it to make pet food. They used it to make fish meal," he told reporters. Federal health and food officials have said some 20 million chickens and thousands of hogs also were fed feed contaminated by melamine. As with the fish, they said the risk to human health is very low. U.S. investigators also have learned that the purported Chinese wheat gluten and a second ingredient, rice protein concentrate, were actually simple wheat flour. The flour was spiked with melamine and related, nitrogen-rich compounds to make it appear more protein rich than it was. In tests, nitrogen levels are measured to gauge the overall protein content of food ingredients. "What we discovered is these are not wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate but in fact are wheat flour contaminated by melamine," Acheson said. The FDA is considering enforcement options, he added. The ingredients came from two Chinese firms: Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co. and Futian Biology Technology Co. Ltd.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7393876.html	Clinton Foundation deal to lower cost of AIDS drugs | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Clinton Foundation deal to lower cost of AIDS drugs Story Published: May 8, 2007 at 11:51 AM PDT Story Updated: May 8, 2007 at 11:51 AM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - Former President Bill Clinton announced agreements with drug companies Tuesday to lower the price of so-called "second-line" AIDS drugs for people in the developing world and to make a once-a-day AIDS pill available for less than $1 a day. The anti-retroviral drugs are needed by patients who develop resistance to first-line treatment and currently cost 10 times as much as first-line therapy, Clinton said. Nearly half a million patients will require these drugs by 2010. Clinton's foundation negotiated agreements with generic drug makers Cipla Ltd. and Matrix Laboratories Ltd. that he said would mean an average savings of 25 percent in low-income countries and 50 percent in middle-income countries. He said the companies collaborated with the foundation to lower production costs, in part by securing lower prices for raw materials. The reduced-price, once-daily pill combines the drugs tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz. Clinton said the new price of $339 per patient per year would be 45 percent lower than the current rate available to low-income countries and 67 percent less than the price available to many middle-income countries "Seven million people in the developing world are in need of treatment for HIV/AIDS," Clinton said. "We are trying to meet that need with the best medicine available today, and at prices that low and middle-income countries can afford." The Clinton Foundation's activities are being financed by UNITAID, an organization formed by France and 19 other nations that have earmarked a small portion of their airline tax revenues for HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries. UNITAID will provide the foundation with more than $100 million to buy second-line medicines for 27 countries through 2008. "Every person living with HIV deserves access to the most effective medicines, and UNITAID aims to ensure that these are affordable for all developing countries," French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy, chairman of UNITAID's board, said in a statement. Since starting its HIV/AIDS Initiative in 2002, the Clinton Foundation has worked with 25 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia to set up AIDS treatment and prevention programs. The foundation also provides access to lower-priced AIDS drugs in 65 countries. Some 750,000 people are now receiving AIDS drugs purchased through the Clinton Foundation.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7418606.html	Dentists say children's dental health has not improved | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Dentists say children's dental health has not improved Story Published: May 9, 2007 at 9:06 AM PDT Story Updated: May 9, 2007 at 9:06 AM PDT BEND, Ore. (AP) - Dental health may not be getting any worse for Oregon children, but dentists say they see few signs that it is improving. "I've seen a lot of it for a long time," said Dr. Cate Quas, a pediatric dentist in Bend who treats many Oregon Health Plan patients. "I see horrendous stuff in preschoolers." Quas said she recently pulled 10 of a little boy's 20 teeth because the decay was so extensive. She said the boy told her he looked like an old man so she made him a retainer with prosthetic teeth. "What happens is that families, they let the problem get too bad because they don't know where to go and they can't afford it. Of course it just snowballs and they end up with a toothache or an infection," said Vickie Matthews, coordinator of the Kemple Children's Clinic, which coordinates dental care for low-income children in Central Oregon. "We have had some kids here with life-threatening infections," Matthews said. According to a report released in November by the Oregon Department of Human Services, 56 percent of children ages 6 to 8 in Oregon have had dental caries, which is tooth decay that can lead to cavities. Nationwide, 50 percent of children in the same age group have experienced dental caries, although the overall prevalence of tooth decay in older children is decreasing. "Oregon has an oral disease burden. It's a silent epidemic," said Brett Hamilton, managing director of public and professional education for the Oregon Dental Association. "A lot of times people don't associate their mouth with their whole body or realize that their mouth is part of their overall health." Quas blames too much milk or sugary drinks for much of the problem. "The stuff you see in preschoolers is generally created when they are toddlers," she said. "It's not like between the ages of 2 and 5 the tooth decay becomes rampant." Some parents give their children juice in sippy cups and let them carry the sugary drink around all day, or put them to bed with milk in their bottles, Quas said. Sugars in the fluids coat the teeth, giving bacteria a chance to take hold. "The food pools on top of the teeth and the bacteria have a heyday," Quas said. "They have little parties all night long and eat into the teeth." Instead, Quas and other dentists recommend giving children water in sippy cups or bottles instead of drinks that are high in sugar. Often parents also don't realize that recommendations on dental care have changed, said Dr. Mike Shirtcliff, president and CEO of Northwest Dental Services in Redmond. The group of almost 300 Oregon dentists works to improve access to basic dental care in rural areas of the state. "The mythology in dentistry is you don't treat pregnant women unless it is an emergency and you don't treat kids until they are 30 months old," Shirtcliff said. But now the professional standard is to treat pregnant women, and babies should be seen before their first birthday. "We've been working hard to change the standard of care. It's going from old knowledge to new knowledge." Shirtcliff's organization works to educate and encourage dentists to treat more patients with Oregon Health Plan coverage. Because the Oregon Health Plan does not reimburse at as high a rate as other types of insurance, he said, sometimes dentists are reluctant to participate. In Central Oregon there are plenty of pediatric dentists, Shirtcliff said. But places like Douglas County, the Southern Oregon coast and areas of Eastern Oregon have a limited number of pediatric dentists to serve the population. Dentists also recommend fluoridation of drinking water to prevent decay. The Oregon Dental Association has been pushing the state Legislature for years to mandate that Oregon's drinking water be fluoridated, Hamilton said. "There seems to be more and more decay," said Dr. Dean Nyquist, a Bend dentist who sees many young children with serious dental problems. "Especially in our area where we do not have fluoride in the water. It makes a big difference." Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7419176.html	Study links lung scarring disease to post-Sept. 11 WTC work | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Study links lung scarring disease to post-Sept. 11 WTC work Story Published: May 9, 2007 at 9:38 AM PDT Story Updated: May 9, 2007 at 9:38 AM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - Rescue workers and firefighters contracted a serious lung-scarring disease called sarcoidosis at a much higher rate after the Sept. 11 attacks than before, said a study that is the first to link the disease to exposure to toxic dust at ground zero. The study, published by nine doctors including the medical officer monitoring city firefighters, Dr. David Prezant, found that firefighters and rescue workers contracted sarcoidosis in the year after Sept. 11, 2001, at a rate more than five times higher than the years before the attacks. Unlike previous studies that have linked exposure to the toxic dust cloud that enveloped lower Manhattan after the World Trade Center's collapse to many different respiratory illnesses, this study zeros in on one disease. Sarcoidosis, which can be life-threatening, causes an inflammation in the lungs that deposits tiny cells in the organs, leaving scar tissues that damage them. Several rescue workers and others exposed to trade center dust have claimed they contracted the disease from their work at ground zero. The study compared the rates of contracting sarcoidosis among fire department employees for 15 years before Sept. 11 and for five years after it. It said firefighters who showed symptoms of the disease on chest X-rays underwent more intensive exams. After the trade center attack, 26 firefighters were diagnosed with sarcoidosis, the study found. Thirteen were diagnosed in the first year after the attacks, which represents a rate of 86 per 100,000. In the 15 years before the attack, the rate of sarcoidosis was 15 per 100,0000, the study found. None of the 26 rescue workers, who are in their 30s and 40s, has died of the disease, and about 10 have improved or recovered since their diagnoses, the study found. Two of the firefighters were former smokers, the study found. The study was published this week in the May issue of CHEST Physician, a journal published by the American College of Chest Physicians.

The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine contended the weight loss claims were false and misleading. The group, in a 2005 petition, asked the commission to order a halt to the dairy advertisements. The agency did not take that step, but said in a letter to the committee that the groups behind the ads planned to end them. "It is obvious that the industry did not have a leg to stand on," Neal Barnard, president of the Washington-based doctors committee, said Thursday. His group advocates a vegan diet, which typically includes no animal products. The two marketing campaigns at issue involve the "Milk your diet. Lose Weight!" ads on television, Internet and in magazines, and the "3-A-Day. Burn More Fat, Lose Weight" ads, which are now mostly Web-based. The FTC, in a letter May 3 to the committee, said the agency met with Agriculture Department officials and representatives for the two campaigns, which decided "to discontinue all advertising and other marketing activities involving weight loss claims until further research provides stronger, more conclusive evidence." Susan Ruland, a spokeswoman for the "Milk your Diet" campaign, said there was nothing misleading about the ads. "We absolutely stand behind our weight loss campaign and the science supporting our messages," said Ruland, who represents the National Fluid Milk Processor Promotion Board. "There's a strong body of scientific evidence that demonstrates a connection between dairy and weight loss." Still, she said, the board plans to phase out the milk ads and focus the campaign instead on how dairy can help promote a healthy diet. The National Dairy Promotion and Research Board said it has already changed its "3-A-Day" campaign. The Agriculture Department, which has oversight of the two boards, had approved the ads.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7464627.html	Merck vaccine production problem means extra shot for kids | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Merck vaccine production problem means extra shot for kids Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 11:56 AM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 11:56 AM PDT TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Young children needing immunization against chickenpox and three other diseases likely will have to get an extra shot, due to manufacturing problems that have halted production of a four-disease combo vaccine made by Merck & Co. Merck said Thursday that its ProQuad vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella as well as chickenpox, won't be available from about July until at least year's end. "It's too early to say at this point whether new (ProQuad) supplies will be available in 2008," said Mary Elizabeth Blake, spokeswoman for Merck's vaccines division. However, the drugmaker expects to have plenty of two separate vaccines that cover the same diseases: Varivax, for chickenpox, and M-M-R II, for measles, mumps and rubella. The federal government recommends children get each of those shots twice, once at age 12 months to 15 months and again between ages four and six years old, or - when available - they can receive the ProQuad vaccine twice. Last year, the government recommended the second chickenpox shot because of outbreaks among schoolchildren, apparently due to waning potency of the vaccine. Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck is the only U.S. source for vaccines against the varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox in children and shingles in adults. Blake said Merck decided to shift available supply of the key vaccine ingredient against chickenpox - live but weakened varicella virus - from ProQuad to Varivax and its shingles vaccine, Zostavax. The drugmaker recently informed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of its decision. "It makes sense to cut back on ProQuad first" because that requires more virus, said Dr. Lance Rodewald, director of the CDC's immunization services division. He said the agency had been assured there would be an adequate supply of both Varivax, with an expected demand of more than 8 million doses, and Merck's Zostavax vaccine against shingles. Zostavax was just approved last May and is recommended for all adults aged 60 and older. Shingles, also called herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash that strikes roughly one in four adults who previously had chickenpox. The government does not have a firm projection of demand for Zostavax, Rodewald said. According to the CDC, Merck charges private doctors about $45 for M-M-R II and $75 for Varivax, slightly less than the $125 price for ProQuad. All or most of the cost of getting the shots is generally covered by private insurance and the federal Vaccines for Children program for the poor. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Merck shares fell 97 cents to $51.08, near their 52-week high of $52.63. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

(AP) - Young children needing immunization against chickenpox and three other diseases likely will have to get an extra shot, due to manufacturing problems that have halted production of a four-disease combo vaccine made by Merck & Co. Merck said Thursday that its ProQuad vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps and rubella as well as chickenpox, won't be available from about July until at least year's end. "It's too early to say at this point whether new (ProQuad) supplies will be available in 2008," said Mary Elizabeth Blake, spokeswoman for Merck's vaccines division. However, the drugmaker expects to have plenty of two separate vaccines that cover the same diseases: Varivax, for chickenpox, and M-M-R II, for measles, mumps and rubella. The federal government recommends children get each of those shots twice, once at age 12 months to 15 months and again between ages four and six years old, or - when available - they can receive the ProQuad vaccine twice. Last year, the government recommended the second chickenpox shot because of outbreaks among schoolchildren, apparently due to waning potency of the vaccine. Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based Merck is the only U.S. source for vaccines against the varicella zoster virus, which causes chickenpox in children and shingles in adults. Blake said Merck decided to shift available supply of the key vaccine ingredient against chickenpox - live but weakened varicella virus - from ProQuad to Varivax and its shingles vaccine, Zostavax. The drugmaker recently informed the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of its decision. "It makes sense to cut back on ProQuad first" because that requires more virus, said Dr. Lance Rodewald, director of the CDC's immunization services division. He said the agency had been assured there would be an adequate supply of both Varivax, with an expected demand of more than 8 million doses, and Merck's Zostavax vaccine against shingles. Zostavax was just approved last May and is recommended for all adults aged 60 and older. Shingles, also called herpes zoster, is a painful skin rash that strikes roughly one in four adults who previously had chickenpox. The government does not have a firm projection of demand for Zostavax, Rodewald said. According to the CDC, Merck charges private doctors about $45 for M-M-R II and $75 for Varivax, slightly less than the $125 price for ProQuad. All or most of the cost of getting the shots is generally covered by private insurance and the federal Vaccines for Children program for the poor. In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Merck shares fell 97 cents to $51.08, near their 52-week high of $52.63. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

(AP) - Mark Krombholz had to look twice at his new calf, Lucy - one time for each nose. ''I didn't notice anything too different about her until I got her in the barn,'' Krombholz said, ''and all of a sudden I went to feed her a bottle of milk, and I thought maybe she'd been kicked in the nose and there were two noses there.'' The second, smaller nose sits on top of the first. ''It's a functioning nose because the middle of her second nose, the flap would go in and out when she drank out of the bottle like that,'' Krombholz said. ''It was kind of funny.'' Breeder Scott Grund said Lucy's noses seem to be working fine. ''It looked like she was comfortable laying there in her bedding and breathing and spunky just like you want to see,'' Grund said. ''It's just that she's got two noses.'' That kind of rare deformity is usually not the result of genetics, he said. But breeders do track such mutations. ''We'll fill out a form, send that on to the company in Shawano and they will keep record of it,'' Grund said. ''If by chance this would occur more than a few times, they would start looking at maybe the sire that we're using.'' Krombholz said Lucy, who was born May 4, will be a pet and bred if she's able.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7393906.html	VA urged to improve testing, compensation for veterans with stress disorder | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health VA urged to improve testing, compensation for veterans with stress disorder Story Published: May 8, 2007 at 11:53 AM PDT Story Updated: May 8, 2007 at 11:53 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - The surge in the number of veterans suffering post-traumatic stress disorder requires development of better tests to evaluate affected personnel and determine how best to compensate them, a panel of medical experts said Tuesday. "As the increasing number of claims to the VA shows, PTSD has become a very significant public health problem," said Nancy Andreasen, chair of the committee that prepared the report. "Our review of the current methods for evaluating PTSD disability claims and determining compensation indicates that a comprehensive revision is needed," said Andreasen, head of the psychiatry department at Carver College of Medicine, University of Iowa. Claims increased from 120,265 in 1999 to 215,871 in 2004 and payments jumped from $1.72 billion to $4.28 billion in the same period, a combined committee from the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council said. "VA is studying the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the report to determine actions that can be taken to further enhance the services we provide," VA press secretary Matt Burns said. "VA is a recognized leader in the diagnosis and treatment of PTSD, and we will continue to take steps to ensure veterans have timely and seamless access to compensation for which they are eligible," he added. While the largest share of claims is still coming from Vietnam War veterans, there are expected to be many more claims in future from personnel who served in the first Gulf War and in the current conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, the panel said. But the Veterans Affairs Department uses only crude criteria for rating disabilities due to mental illness and is not consistent for relapsing conditions, according to the report, which had been requested by the VA. The panel urged the VA to develop new criteria based on the diagnostic standards of the American Psychiatric Association and to establish certification programs for workers who deal with PTSD claims. The panel said the VA should base compensation decisions on how greatly PTSD affects all aspects of a veteran's daily life, not just his or her ability to be gainfully employed. Andreasen noted that in the case of a paraplegic, compensation is based on both ability to work and quality of life, while in the case of mental illness, currently the ratings are tightly linked to the ability to be employed. The report also noted that PTSD can be triggered by trauma other than combat, such as sexual assault. Female veterans are less likely to receive compensation for PTSD, which may in part be due to the difficulty of substantiating exposure to traumatic events unrelated to combat, including sexual harassment or assaults that occurred during service, the report said. It urged the VA to gather data and provide reference materials to help disability raters better address the management of PTSD claims related to sexual assault during military service. Dr. Robert J. Ursano, chairman of the department of psychiatry at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md., a member of the committee, said the recommendations are complex and the VA will have to study how to implement them over time. The Institute of Medicine and National Research Council are branches of the National Academy of Sciences, an independent organization chartered by Congress to advise the government on scientific matters.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7441506.html	FDA approves patch to treat early Parkinson's symptoms | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health FDA approves patch to treat early Parkinson's symptoms Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 9:00 AM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 9:00 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - The treatment options for patients with early Parkinson's expanded Wednesday with the approval of a new drug in patch form - a first for medicines to treat symptoms of the disease. The once-daily Neupro patch contains a drug called rotigotine, which has not been sold before in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration said. The drug patch, made by Schwarz Pharma AG, is the first for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease results from the loss of dopamine-producing brain cells. Dopamine is crucial for the communication between cells that control muscle movement, which explains the trembling commonly seen in Parkinson's patients. Rotigotine works by activating dopamine receptors in the brain, mimicking the neurotransmitter's effect. The most common side effects for Neupro include skin reactions at the patch site, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and insomnia, the FDA said. Most are typical with this class of drugs. Other potential safety concerns include sudden onset of sleep while engaged in activities such as driving or operating machinery, hallucinations and decreased blood pressure when standing up, the agency said. An estimated 1 million people in the U.S. have Parkinson's, with an additional 60,000 cases diagnosed each year. Belgium's UCB bought Germany-based Schwarz Pharma last year.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7441546.html	Purdue Pharma executives plead guilty to misleading public about OxyContin addiction | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Purdue Pharma executives plead guilty to misleading public about OxyContin addiction Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 9:02 AM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 1:45 PM PDT ROANOKE, Va. (AP) - The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin and three of its current and former executives pleaded guilty Thursday to misleading the public about the drug's risk of addiction, a federal prosecutor and the company said. Purdue Pharma L.P., its president, top lawyer and former chief medical officer will pay $634.5 million in fines for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications, U.S. Attorney John Brownlee said in a news release. The plea comes two days after the Stamford, Conn.-based company agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia to settle complaints that it encouraged physicians to overprescribe OxyContin. "With its OxyContin, Purdue unleashed a highly abusable, addictive, and potentially dangerous drug on an unsuspecting and unknowing public," Brownlee said. "For these misrepresentations and crimes, Purdue and its executives have been brought to justice." Privately held Purdue Pharma said it accepted responsibility for its employees' actions. "During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again," the company said in a news release. OxyContin, a trade name for oxycodone, is a time-release painkiller that can be highly addictive. Designed to be swallowed whole and digested over 12 hours, the pills can produce a heroin-like high if crushed and then swallowed, snorted or injected. From 1996 to 2001, the number of oxycodone-related deaths nationwide increased 400 percent while the annual number of OxyContin prescriptions increased nearly 20-fold, according to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2002, the DEA said the drug caused 146 deaths and contributed to another 318. In western Virginia, 228 people died from overdoses of oxycodone from 1996 to 2005, Brownlee said. The fines will be distributed to state and federal law enforcement agencies, the federal government, federal and state Medicaid programs, a Virginia prescription monitoring program and individuals who had sued the company.

(AP) - The maker of the powerful painkiller OxyContin and three of its current and former executives pleaded guilty Thursday to misleading the public about the drug's risk of addiction, a federal prosecutor and the company said. Purdue Pharma L.P., its president, top lawyer and former chief medical officer will pay $634.5 million in fines for claiming the drug was less addictive and less subject to abuse than other pain medications, U.S. Attorney John Brownlee said in a news release. The plea comes two days after the Stamford, Conn.-based company agreed to pay $19.5 million to 26 states and the District of Columbia to settle complaints that it encouraged physicians to overprescribe OxyContin. "With its OxyContin, Purdue unleashed a highly abusable, addictive, and potentially dangerous drug on an unsuspecting and unknowing public," Brownlee said. "For these misrepresentations and crimes, Purdue and its executives have been brought to justice." Privately held Purdue Pharma said it accepted responsibility for its employees' actions. "During the past six years, we have implemented changes to our internal training, compliance and monitoring systems that seek to assure that similar events do not occur again," the company said in a news release. OxyContin, a trade name for oxycodone, is a time-release painkiller that can be highly addictive. Designed to be swallowed whole and digested over 12 hours, the pills can produce a heroin-like high if crushed and then swallowed, snorted or injected. From 1996 to 2001, the number of oxycodone-related deaths nationwide increased 400 percent while the annual number of OxyContin prescriptions increased nearly 20-fold, according to a report by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. In 2002, the DEA said the drug caused 146 deaths and contributed to another 318. In western Virginia, 228 people died from overdoses of oxycodone from 1996 to 2005, Brownlee said. The fines will be distributed to state and federal law enforcement agencies, the federal government, federal and state Medicaid programs, a Virginia prescription monitoring program and individuals who had sued the company.

The Canadian-made meal included what was purported to be wheat gluten, a protein source, imported from China. The material was actually wheat flour spiked by the chemical melamine and related, nitrogen-rich compounds to make it appear more protein rich than it was, officials said. After pigs and chickens, the farmed fish mark the third food animal given contaminated feed. The level of contamination is expected to be too low to pose any danger to human health, said Dr. David Acheson, the FDA's assistant commissioner for food protection. It wasn't immediately clear if any of the farmed fish entered the food supply. However, Acheson said at least one firm's fish were still too young and small to be sold. Investigators were visiting other U.S. aquaculture farms that used the contaminated feed. Melamine, a chemical found in plastics and pesticides and not approved for use in pet or human in the U.S., contaminated pet food that either sickened or killed an unknown number of dogs and cats. Since March 16, more than 100 brands of pet food have been recalled because they were contaminated with melamine. Acheson said that fish samples would be screened for signs of melamine. "Depending upon what we find in that testing, that is going to drive the next steps," Acheson said. Canadian officials are aware of the finding, Acheson said. "We used it to make pet food. They used it to make fish meal," he told reporters. Federal health and food officials have said some 20 million chickens and thousands of hogs also were fed feed contaminated by melamine. As with the fish, they said the risk to human health is very low. U.S. investigators also have learned that the purported Chinese wheat gluten and a second ingredient, rice protein concentrate, were actually simple wheat flour. The flour was spiked with melamine and related, nitrogen-rich compounds to make it appear more protein rich than it was. In tests, nitrogen levels are measured to gauge the overall protein content of food ingredients. "What we discovered is these are not wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate but in fact are wheat flour contaminated by melamine," Acheson said. The FDA is considering enforcement options, he added. The ingredients came from two Chinese firms: Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology Development Co. and Futian Biology Technology Co. Ltd.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7393876.html	Clinton Foundation deal to lower cost of AIDS drugs | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Clinton Foundation deal to lower cost of AIDS drugs Story Published: May 8, 2007 at 11:51 AM PDT Story Updated: May 8, 2007 at 11:51 AM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - Former President Bill Clinton announced agreements with drug companies Tuesday to lower the price of so-called "second-line" AIDS drugs for people in the developing world and to make a once-a-day AIDS pill available for less than $1 a day. The anti-retroviral drugs are needed by patients who develop resistance to first-line treatment and currently cost 10 times as much as first-line therapy, Clinton said. Nearly half a million patients will require these drugs by 2010. Clinton's foundation negotiated agreements with generic drug makers Cipla Ltd. and Matrix Laboratories Ltd. that he said would mean an average savings of 25 percent in low-income countries and 50 percent in middle-income countries. He said the companies collaborated with the foundation to lower production costs, in part by securing lower prices for raw materials. The reduced-price, once-daily pill combines the drugs tenofovir, lamivudine and efavirenz. Clinton said the new price of $339 per patient per year would be 45 percent lower than the current rate available to low-income countries and 67 percent less than the price available to many middle-income countries "Seven million people in the developing world are in need of treatment for HIV/AIDS," Clinton said. "We are trying to meet that need with the best medicine available today, and at prices that low and middle-income countries can afford." The Clinton Foundation's activities are being financed by UNITAID, an organization formed by France and 19 other nations that have earmarked a small portion of their airline tax revenues for HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries. UNITAID will provide the foundation with more than $100 million to buy second-line medicines for 27 countries through 2008. "Every person living with HIV deserves access to the most effective medicines, and UNITAID aims to ensure that these are affordable for all developing countries," French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy, chairman of UNITAID's board, said in a statement. Since starting its HIV/AIDS Initiative in 2002, the Clinton Foundation has worked with 25 countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Asia to set up AIDS treatment and prevention programs. The foundation also provides access to lower-priced AIDS drugs in 65 countries. Some 750,000 people are now receiving AIDS drugs purchased through the Clinton Foundation.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7418606.html	Dentists say children's dental health has not improved | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Health Dentists say children's dental health has not improved Story Published: May 9, 2007 at 9:06 AM PDT Story Updated: May 9, 2007 at 9:06 AM PDT BEND, Ore. (AP) - Dental health may not be getting any worse for Oregon children, but dentists say they see few signs that it is improving. "I've seen a lot of it for a long time," said Dr. Cate Quas, a pediatric dentist in Bend who treats many Oregon Health Plan patients. "I see horrendous stuff in preschoolers." Quas said she recently pulled 10 of a little boy's 20 teeth because the decay was so extensive. She said the boy told her he looked like an old man so she made him a retainer with prosthetic teeth. "What happens is that families, they let the problem get too bad because they don't know where to go and they can't afford it. Of course it just snowballs and they end up with a toothache or an infection," said Vickie Matthews, coordinator of the Kemple Children's Clinic, which coordinates dental care for low-income children in Central Oregon. "We have had some kids here with life-threatening infections," Matthews said. According to a report released in November by the Oregon Department of Human Services, 56 percent of children ages 6 to 8 in Oregon have had dental caries, which is tooth decay that can lead to cavities. Nationwide, 50 percent of children in the same age group have experienced dental caries, although the overall prevalence of tooth decay in older children is decreasing. "Oregon has an oral disease burden. It's a silent epidemic," said Brett Hamilton, managing director of public and professional education for the Oregon Dental Association. "A lot of times people don't associate their mouth with their whole body or realize that their mouth is part of their overall health." Quas blames too much milk or sugary drinks for much of the problem. "The stuff you see in preschoolers is generally created when they are toddlers," she said. "It's not like between the ages of 2 and 5 the tooth decay becomes rampant." Some parents give their children juice in sippy cups and let them carry the sugary drink around all day, or put them to bed with milk in their bottles, Quas said. Sugars in the fluids coat the teeth, giving bacteria a chance to take hold. "The food pools on top of the teeth and the bacteria have a heyday," Quas said. "They have little parties all night long and eat into the teeth." Instead, Quas and other dentists recommend giving children water in sippy cups or bottles instead of drinks that are high in sugar. Often parents also don't realize that recommendations on dental care have changed, said Dr. Mike Shirtcliff, president and CEO of Northwest Dental Services in Redmond. The group of almost 300 Oregon dentists works to improve access to basic dental care in rural areas of the state. "The mythology in dentistry is you don't treat pregnant women unless it is an emergency and you don't treat kids until they are 30 months old," Shirtcliff said. But now the professional standard is to treat pregnant women, and babies should be seen before their first birthday. "We've been working hard to change the standard of care. It's going from old knowledge to new knowledge." Shirtcliff's organization works to educate and encourage dentists to treat more patients with Oregon Health Plan coverage. Because the Oregon Health Plan does not reimburse at as high a rate as other types of insurance, he said, sometimes dentists are reluctant to participate. In Central Oregon there are plenty of pediatric dentists, Shirtcliff said. But places like Douglas County, the Southern Oregon coast and areas of Eastern Oregon have a limited number of pediatric dentists to serve the population. Dentists also recommend fluoridation of drinking water to prevent decay. The Oregon Dental Association has been pushing the state Legislature for years to mandate that Oregon's drinking water be fluoridated, Hamilton said. "There seems to be more and more decay," said Dr. Dean Nyquist, a Bend dentist who sees many young children with serious dental problems. "Especially in our area where we do not have fluoride in the water. It makes a big difference." Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!
