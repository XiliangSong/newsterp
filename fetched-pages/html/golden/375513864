The Australian team has used nanotechnology to create tiny particles which specifically attack cancer cells, but leave healthy tissue unaffected. The particles - or mini-cells - are tagged with anti-cancer antibodies so they zero in on their target. The research features in the journal Cancer Cell. There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel It is hoped the technique could treat tumours in the breast, ovaries, colon and lungs. So far it has been used in mice and dogs, and the researchers plan to begin human trials shortly. Traditional chemotherapy typically involves subjecting the patient's entire body to powerful drugs, which can cause a range of severe side-effects. The mini-cells - about one-fifth the size of a normal cell - were created from bacteria cells stripped of their reproductive powers. They were then loaded with cancer drugs, and tagged with antibodies which are attracted to cancerous tumours. Once the cell reaches the cancer, the drug is released directly into the malignant growth. Researcher Jennifer MacDiarmid, from Sydney-based biotechnology company EnGeneIC, said: "There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel." In tests, the technique reduced tumours in animals without side effects - and by using only a very small amount of drug. Dr MacDiarmid said the treatment could potentially be used on any solid tumours. She said the technique potentially paved the way for customised drug cocktails for individual patients. Professor Quentin Pankhurst, of the London Centre for Nanotechnology, said: "The concept of targeted drug delivery is something which has been around for a while and there are many different avenues that have been tested. "This one looks like an interesting and promising one. "I particularly like the fact that these mini-cells, as they call them, seem to be swallowed up by the cancer cells and taken inside the cancer cells, because that is inherently a very powerful way to actually deliver the drug - actually into the cell."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/essex/6644841.stm	BBC NEWS | England | Essex | Gynaecologist lacked op consent Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 20:02 GMT 21:02 UK E-mail this to a friend Gynaecologist lacked op consent The General Medical Council said the case was "wholly exceptional" A gynaecologist who failed to obtain consent from a woman for an operation which left her unable to have sex has not been struck off. The General Medical Council (GMC) ruled it had been an "exceptional" case that saw Essex-based Dr June Swinhoe fail in her practise. Marian Howland, 52, from Epping, had not been made aware of risks linked to her operation for a prolapse in 2003. The GMC panel ruled Dr Swinhoe posed no risk to patients. In March 2003, Dr Swinhoe was working as a consultant gynaecologist at King George Hospital in Ilford and privately at Holly House Hospital in Buckhurst Hill. I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily Mrs Howland had been married for eight years when she visited Dr Swinhoe with a prolapse and discomfort during sex. She told the panel she was admitted for the prolapse to be repaired but was not informed of all the side effects or of any risks associated with the procedures. Dr Swinhoe had not taken a full medical history from Mrs Howland who had previously had a hysterectomy, her ovaries removed and become blind in one eye. In tears, Mrs Howland told the panel a few weeks after the operation it became clear she had been left unable to have sex, and had been left "shell-shocked". She added: "I have lost my best friend, my husband, my lover. "I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily." The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care. "The finding that your fitness is impaired is, in itself, a very significant mark on your record. "You have learned from this distressing experience. "This is a wholly exceptional case and in the circumstances the panel is satisfied that it is fair, proportionate and sufficient to conclude the case without taking any action in respect of your registration."

HPV infection was found to be a much stronger risk factor than tobacco or alcohol use, the Johns Hopkins University study of 300 people found. The New England Journal of Medicine study said the risk was almost nine times higher for people who reported oral sex with more than six partners. But experts said a larger study was needed to confirm the findings. HPV infection is the cause of the majority of cervical cancers, and 80% of sexually active women can expect to have an HPV infection at some point in their lives. It is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza, study author The Johns Hopkins study took blood and saliva from 100 men and women newly diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer which affects the throat, tonsils and back of the tongue. They also asked questions about sex practices and other risk factors for the disease, such as family history. Those who had evidence of prior oral HPV infection had a 32-fold increased risk of throat cancer. HPV16 - one of the most common cancer-causing strains of the virus - was present in the tumours of 72% of cancer patients in the study. There was no added risk for people infected with HPV who also smoked and drank alcohol, suggesting the virus itself is driving the risk of the cancer. Oral sex was said to be the main mode of transmission of HPV but the researchers said mouth-to-mouth transmission, for example through kissing, could not be ruled out. Most HPV infections clear with little or no symptoms but a small percentage of people who acquired high-risk strains may develop a cancer, the researchers added. Study author Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza said: "It is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer." Co-researcher Dr Maura Gillison said previous research by the team had suggested there was a strong link. But she added: "People should be reassured that oropharyngeal cancer is relatively uncommon and the overwhelming majority of people with an oral HPV infection probably will not get throat cancer." A vaccine which protects against cervical cancer caused by HPV strains 6, 11, 16 and 18, and also against genital warts is available and the researchers said the study provided a rationale for vaccinating both girls and boys. But whether the vaccine would protect against oral HPV infection is not yet known. Dr Julie Sharp, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: "There is conflicting evidence about the role of HPV, and this rare type of mouth cancer. "As this was a small study, further research is needed to confirm these observations." "We know that after age, the main causes of mouth cancer are smoking or chewing tobacco or betel nut, and drinking too much alcohol."

Half of children enter primary school unable to speak as well as they are expected to, research suggests. The Early Talk programme which uses gestures, symbols and signing to expand vocabulary, is being piloted in 200 government-backed children's centres. It will also be used to target youngsters with potential difficulties. Television doesn't respond well to children. ICAN head of Early Years Clare Geldard, head of Early Years for the charity behind the programme, I CAN, said there were concerns that the number of pre-school children with speech and language difficulties was on the rise. "We don't know why this is the case and I am sure there are a myriad of reasons. "We know that television can be used in a really productive way in terms of watching a piece of television and then having a conversation about it afterwards, but we also know that television doesn't respond well to children. "It does not give them the interactivity that children and adults instinctively seek from adults." She said the Early Talk programme was about ensuring that nursery staff, childminders and parents had the basic skills they needed to enhance children's speech, language and communication. "Everybody needs to have a basic knowledge about what we can do to enhance children's speech and language development," she said. But it was also about ensuring that those children who had the potential to go on to develop speech and language difficulties were picked up early and given the help they need. I CAN's chief executive Virginia Beardshaw said one in 10 children across the UK were thought to have a communication disability. She added that the Early Talk programme, which will ultimately be rolled out to 3,000 Sure Start children's centres, would foster environments "where communication is embedded". This would range from using pictures, symbols and gestures to teach vocabulary to using group work and specialist help from speech and language therapists, she said. Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: "Communication is a vital skill in life and we want to help all children communicate better and reap the rewards of that later in life. "This is especially important for children who have trouble communicating - particularly those with a communication disability - who are much more likely to develop behavioural and learning problems." She said she hoped the partnership being announced would play a vital role in identifying children's difficulties at an early stage. Nursery and children's centre staff will be given training and packages of support to help ensure children's language skills are polished and it is hoped this will be passed on to parents and children's carers.

Three of his classmates were confirmed to also be in the early stages of the disease, which the Health Protection Agency said is not contracted easily.

However, patients may find problems getting Avastin, as the NHS drugs watchdogs have yet to consider whether to sanction its use. The drug is designed to be used in tandem with another chemotherapy agent, paclitaxel. Avastin, which works by starving cancer cells of a blood supply, has previously been used to treat bowel cancer. All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options However, the drug was rejected for NHS use in England and Wales for that purpose last year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that it was not cost-effective. In trials, breast cancer patients who took Avastin and paclitaxel went an average of 13 months without their cancer growing, compared with an average of 6.7 months for patients who took paclitaxel alone. Professor David Miles, a consultant medical oncologist at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Middlesex, said: "This provides some hope for the 13,000 patients a year that are told the devastating news they have metastatic breast cancer which cannot be cured with surgery. "It is an important step forward to have discovered another targeted treatment which can inhibit the growth of breast cancer and as a result increase significantly the time that patients' breast cancer is controlled." Dr Emma Pennery, a nurse consultant at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said women with secondary breast cancer would welcome any treatment that could potentially slow down the progression of their disease. "This announcement means that there is now another treatment option available, adding to the growing range of targeted drugs for breast cancer." Dr Pennery called on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium to appraise the drug as soon as possible. Dr Sarah Rawlings, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "The development of targeted therapies like this is an important step forward in cancer treatment. "Avastin is an additional treatment option that will be welcomed by women with metastatic breast cancer, although it's important to remember it might not be suitable for everyone. "All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/health/2000/heart_disease/default.stm	BBC News | Health | Heart Disease The UK has one of the highest rates of death from heart disease in the world - one British adult dies from the disease every three minutes - and stroke is the country's third biggest killer, claiming 70,000 lives each year. Heart attacks occur when blood flow is blocked, often by a blood clot, while strokes are caused either by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain. A range of other conditions, including heart failure, when blood is not pumped properly around the body, and congenital heart defects can also cause long term problems, and even death, for sufferers. - The blood returns from the lungs to the upper left chamber of the heart where it is again briefly stored until the atrium fills, before flowing on to the left ventricle. - Impure or blue blood returning from the atrium enters the heart here, where it is held until the atrium - or chamber - fills up. - This is the most powerful chamber of the heart. It pumps the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta, or main artery. - This powerful pump propels blood into the pulmonary artery, the tube which carries blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide in the blood is removed and oxygen added.

The study also said that parents who do not want their children to drink behind their backs should limit their pocket money to less than £10 a week. The study, led by Liverpool John Moores University, was based on responses from more than 10,000 15 and 16-year-olds. Almost 90% admitted to drinking alcohol, of which 38% binged, 24% drank frequently and 50% drank in public. Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol Liverpool John Moores University The study also found a third of respondents bought their own alcohol, and those that did were six times more likely to drink in public, and twice as likely to binge than those who had alcohol bought for them. Last month the charity Alcohol Concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted following figures suggesting a large increase in alcohol consumption by 11 to 13-year-olds. But the latest study, published in the journal Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy, questions this approach. Lead researcher Dr Mark Bellis said figures suggested that 75% of 14-year-olds had tried alcohol. "The question is: are they learning to drink from their parents in a socially responsible environment, or are they learning behind some bushes in the park, or in a bar where they should not be in the first place? "The chances are if they are in the latter position they are learning to binge drink, they are hiding their drinking, they can't talk to their parents about it. "Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol, and how to consume in moderation." Dr Bellis said criminalising a parent for allowing a child to drink was probably not going to help any family. Frank Soodeen, campaigns officer for Alcohol Concern, said the charity had taken its lead from the law, which prohibits under-15s from being served alcohol in public places. He agreed that it was appropriate for parents to allow drinking in the home for older teenagers - but reiterated the charity's view that younger teenagers should not be encouraged to drink. He said: "We agree that parents have a real role to play in raising socially responsible drinkers." The researchers say that increasing the cost of alcohol, and closing down retailers who sell to underage drinkers could help tackle the problem.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6643547.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 UK E-mail this to a friend Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Aspirin could benefit high-risk groups, the study says Taking aspirin each day can prevent bowel cancer developing, a study says. Oxford University researchers said taking a dose of 300mg a day for five years offered the protection. Long-term aspirin use is generally not backed because of the risk of stomach problems, but the team said it could benefit those at high-risk of cancer. Cancer campaigners welcomed the study - published in the Lancet - which examined data from previous research covering more than 7,500 people. These findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. Each year, around 35,000 men and women in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer, and more than 16,000 die from the disease. The researchers looked at the results from two large-scale UK trials carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s covering over 7,500 people which had given some people 300, 500 or 1,200mg per day doses of aspirin or a dummy pill for five to seven years. The people in the study were then followed for up to 20 years, and deaths from bowel cancer were logged. The team say it takes at least 10 years to see an effect, because that is how long it takes for a pre-cancerous growths to develop into cancer. Other studies have examined aspirin's benefits. However, this was the first where people were allocated to take different doses of the drug, or the fake version, rather than looking back at the aspirin use of bowel cancer patients and comparing them with healthy people. High risk group 'benefit' The researchers found that taking 300mg of aspirin - the equivalent of one pill - a day for five years reduced the incidence of bowel cancer by 74% in the subsequent 10 to 15 years. An accompanying review of 30 observational studies suggested taking medium-to-high doses of aspirin for 10 years or more reduced the risk of developing the disease by 50%-70%. The protective effect of aspirin appeared to be consistent regardless of age, sex, race or country of origin. It was also seen in individuals who had a close family relative with bowel cancer, which normally raises the lifetime risk two to four times. Professor Peter Rothwell, who led the research, said: "What we are saying is that for a subgroup of people at high risk of bowel cancer, they probably aren't going to be dramatically harmed by taking aspirin. "They may have some risk of bleeding in the stomach, but they will see potentially significant benefits in the reduction of their colon cancer risk. "In that situation, I think taking aspirin daily would be worthwhile." Dr Andrew Chan, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, writing in the Lancet, said the findings were "convincing evidence" that aspirin can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer. But he added: "With the concerns about the potential risks of long-term aspirin use and the availability of alternative prevention strategies - such as screening - these findings are not sufficient to warrant a recommendation for the general population to use aspirin for cancer prevention." Rob Glynne-Jones, chief medical advisor to the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: "This is very interesting and it certainly confirms what we already know and believe about the links between aspirin, polyps and the development of bowel cancer. "However, these findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. "Aspirin at this dose over a prolonged period of time could lead to potentially serious side effects in a few people."

Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces." A sample of the artificial blood prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics.

It follows a huge rise in cases of Lyme Disease in Scotland and encephalitis amongst travellers to mainland Europe, spread by ticks. Both infections are severely debilitating and can be fatal. A decade ago there were just 10 cases of Lyme Disease in Scotland, but last year that figure had risen to 177. In mainland Europe, tick-borne encephalitis is also on the rise and is now endemic in 27 countries. Make sure you know about bite prevention, how to look out for the early symptoms and remember to seek advice The advice to anyone heading into the countryside is to wear insect repellent and long trousers if possible and to check themselves thoroughly afterwards. Ticks should be removed by gripping them close to the skin with tweezers and pulling backwards without jerking or twisting. They are common in woodland, heath land and in particular areas in Scotland where deer graze. More recently they have also been found in urban parks. A spokesman for the Tick Alert campaign said: "Ticks are second only to mosquitoes for carrying disease to humans. "Travellers and holidaymakers visiting rural areas are at risk from tick bites, but also when spending time in public spaces including beer gardens, picnic spots and parks and gardens. "Make sure you know about bite prevention, how to look out for the early symptoms and remember to seek advice well before your travel date." Wear trousers tucked into socks Check warm folds of the skin Carefully remove with tweezers Do not try to drown in Vaseline Be aware of favoured habitats Lyme disease varies widely but can include a rash and flu-like symptoms in its initial stage, followed by the possibility of musculoskeletal, arthritic, neurological, psychiatric and cardiac problems. Most cases of Lyme disease can be cured with antibiotics, especially if treatment is begun early in the course of illness. Katrina Anderson, from Edinburgh, became ill after she was bitten by a tick in 1991. She was misdiagnosed by her GP who blamed ME for her chronic fatigue and it took another two years before she was told by a specialist that she had contracted Lyme disease. Ms Anderson said: "At the time I was actually very ill. I became very flu-like with muscle pains, constant headaches. "It was like having a virus. It's like a hidden illness. You don't actually see what the person is suffering from. "It can affect all aspects of your nervous system."

Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, said charities had to be wary of pharmaceutical donations. And he urged charities to question the cost of drugs more. But patient groups said there were strict guidelines covering such donations by the drugs industry. I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug Sir Michael Rawlins, of NICE Sir Michael said: "Patient organisations need to think very carefully about why pharmaceutical companies are giving them money and they have to make sure they are not beholden to a pharmaceutical company. "I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug. "When they do that they will come into their own." Sir Michael refused to name individual groups The subject of drug firm donations to patients groups and charities is a sensitive issue. Several groups, although not all, accept donations from drug firms. Most of those that do have codes of conduct setting out what those donations can and cannot be used for - most are restricted to funding education purposes than for campaigning. The Alzheimer's Society is involved in legal action along with Eisai and Pfizer against NICE over the decision to restrict the use of Alzheimer's treatments. The group has accepted money from both companies. But a spokeswoman pointed out that drug firm donations account for less than 1% of its income. She said the society's challenge was being done independently of the drug firms and added donations were never used to fund campaign activity. Breast Cancer Care, which pushed for NICE to approve the so-called breast cancer wonder-drug Herceptin, has received money from its maker Roche. A spokeswoman said any drug industry donations were always used for "impartial patient information". She added it was important there was a dialogue between patient groups and drug companies and she agreed cost was something that needed to be debated. "The cost of drug is clearly becoming a major factor in the potential for cancer treatment and must be addressed." And the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry denied there was anything wrong with such donations. "Patient groups and companies have a shared interest. When they work together it is in the patients' interests, usually to do with education programmes or disease awareness. "Any involvement has to be declared by the company so it is quite transparent."

University officials are considering whether they should ban physiotherapy lecturers from using large exercise balls as chairs. Physiotherapists at the University of Bath say sitting on the balls while working at a desk encourages good posture and tones core muscles. Their professional body agrees that they are beneficial and carry no risk. But health and safety officials are concerned that the giant inflatables may be dangerous. A spokesman for the university said: "The university's health and safety team are looking into whether the balls meet the university's guidelines on conventional chairs to see if the trial can be allowed to become a permanent situation. We expect the result of this shortly." The balls are often used in gyms and are also known as Swiss balls because they were first used in Switzerland in the 1960s by therapists working with children with cerebral palsy. Physiotherapist Sonya Crowe from the university's Department for Health started a trend when she began using an exercise ball instead of a chair. Ms Crowe, who is the sports physiotherapist for the British beach volleyball team, said: "The balls are firm with a bit of give, so it is not difficult to balance on top of them, but the constant small movements you make whilst sitting at a desk are perfect for strengthening your core muscles. "You also have to sit upright, so they are perfect for improving posture. "In particular, people who suffer from back ache and shoulder pain can really benefit from sitting on an exercise ball instead of a regular office chair." She added: "I have never heard of anyone falling off one of the balls - and the health and safety benefits far outweigh any risks there may be." Ms Crowe's colleague Emily Richards said: "You couldn't miss the fact that Sonya was sat on a big squashy ball instead of an office chair. "A few of us tried it out and could see the benefit immediately. We put in a bulk order and now at least a dozen people around the university have got them." She added: "It seems to have started a real craze, and my husband has now got one at his work to help his bad back." The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy said there was no risk if the balls were used properly.

The proposal will go before the board of the Food Standards Agency next week for ratification. If passed, ministers will then decide whether to press ahead. Scientific research shows that folic acid significantly cuts the risk of neural tube defects, which affect up to 900 pregnancies a year in the UK. However, there is concern that adding the vitamin to flour could harm some elderly patients, as it could mask a deficiency in the B12 vitamin. Up to 10% of those aged 65 and older have borderline B12 levels and could tip into deficiency. In extreme cases, this can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system. The recommendation to the FSA board suggests that products containing folic acid at nutritionally significant levels should be clearly labelled. It also argues that mandatory fortification should be accompanied by new controls on the voluntary addition of folic acid to other products, such as breakfast cereals and low-fat spreads, and on the use of folic acid supplements. A system for monitoring the health impact of fortification would also be needed. Wholemeal flour would be exempt from fortification in order to give consumers more choice. The FSA already advises women to eat extra folic acid when trying to get pregnant. However, research suggests that only half of such women adhere to this advice. Also, up to half of pregnancies are unplanned, meaning women may miss the opportunity. Each year between 500 and 600 babies in the UK are reported to have neural tube defects. It is thought many of the other affected pregnancies are terminated. Mandatory fortification has already been introduced in the USA, Canada and Chile, where it cut NTD rates by between 27% and 50%. A panel of UK experts, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), last year backed mandatory fortification of flour. SACN found no evidence that vitamin B12 deficiency was masked in older people, provided folic acid doses were 1mg a day or less. An FSA consultation on the issue drew 202 responses from industry, consumer groups and individuals. The baking industry raised "practical concerns" about the fortification of bread. It said bread-making flour couldn't easily be separated from other flours in mills.

The disease tends to affect older people - but can strike at any time. Excluding certain skin cancers, there were more than 270,000 new cases of the disease in 2001 - and the rate is increasing by about 1% a year. Some cancer, such as breast, are becoming more common, while new cases of lung cancer fall away due to the drop in the number of smokers. However, while the overall number of new cancers is not falling, the good news is that successful treatment rates for many of the most common types are improving rapidly. BBC News Online has produced, in conjunction with Cancer Research UK, a guide to some of the most common forms of cancer and the treatments used to tackle them.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4121411.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Pregnancy timeline Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 23 December, 2004, 13:42 GMT E-mail this to a friend Fertilisation occurs and a ball of quickly multiplying cells embeds itself in the lining of the uterus. In the UK pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last period so for as much as three weeks of this first month she might not be actually pregnant. When fertilisation does occur the tiny mass of cells called a blastocyst at this stage embeds itself in the lining of the womb which is already thickening to support it. The mass of cells is developing fast and becomes an embryo. For many women the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Shopbought tests are considered largely reliable so the mother-to-be does not have to have her pregnancy confirmed by her GP. If a first test is negative a second one a few days later may prove positive as hormone levels in the urine rise. The embryo officially becomes a foetus. It is about the size of a baked bean and its spine and nervous system begin to form. The foetus already has its own blood system and may be a different blood group from its mother. Blood vessels are forming in what will become the umbilical cord and tiny buds which will become limbs appear. The baby&acute;s heart is beginning to develop. Morning sickness and other side effects of early pregnancy may take hold. Around this time many women find they experience the side-effects of early pregnancy including needing to urinate more often nausea and vomiting and feeling a bit weepy and irritable. All medication including supplements need to be carefully checked as the foetus is undergoing vital development in the first 12 weeks. If the woman has not told her GP or community midwife she is pregnant yet now is a good time to do so. It is quite common to have a first scan at this stage if the woman has had a previous miscarriage or bleeding. An early scan is often done through the vagina and is used to check the pregnancy is not ectopic. It should show up the baby&acute;s heartbeat. The nervous system is also developing rapidly especially the brain. The head gets bigger and eyes form under the skin of the face. The foetus' limbs are growing and look more like arms and legs. All internal organs are developing and becoming more complex. The foetus is about 5cm long with its head tucked onto its chest. It has most its major organs and eyes and ears are developing. A scan at 10-13 weeks is recommended to pin down the date of the pregnancy. The umbilical cord is fully formed providing nourishment and removing waste products. The foetus looks fully human now. By this week the threat of miscarriage is much reduced. Many women announce their pregnancy to friends and colleagues. The foetus is growing in length much more quickly by now it is about eight cm long and weighs about 60 grams. The placenta is now wellformed though it's not yet doing its full job it takes over fully in week 14. The mother is likely to have her first scan this week. The womans uterus is becoming larger and is starting to rise out of the pelvis. The foetus can move its head quite easily. Third of the way through. The average pregnancy lasts 266 days or 280 days from the first day of last period. Screening for Downs syndrome is offered about now. A simple blood test is carried out first then further tests may be offered. On the basis of the blood test results the woman may opt for a Chorionic Villus sample or an amniocentesis which would diagnose or other chromosomal abnormalities. However these diagnostic tests have a small risk of subsequent miscarriage. An alternative to blood tests is a nuchal translucency scan a new scan offered by some larger hospitals. But again an amniocentisis would be required for firm diagnosis. The foetus now has toe and finger nails eyebrows and eyelashes. It is also covered with downy hair. The hair that will cover the baby until the last week or so of pregnancy - called lanugo - starts to form. This hair is very fine more like down and it probably serves as some form of insulation and protection for the skin. The foetus can hear noises from the outside world. By this stage the mother is visibly pregnant and the uterus is rising. By this stage the foetus is moving around a lot - probably enough to be felt. The foetus is now about 15-20cm long and weighs about 300g. Milk teeth have formed in the gums. Half way through pregnancy now. Almost all mothers are offered a routine scan. The foetus develops a waxy coating called vernix. The scan can show the foetus in fine detail and often reveal if the baby is a boy or a girl. However not all hospitals offer to tell parents the sex of the child - and not all parents want to know. The mother may feel short of breath as her uterus pushes against her diaphragm leaving less space for the lungs. The mother may be offered another ultrasound scan around this time. The scan can check the baby&acute;s spine internal organs and growth are normal. Senses develop: taste buds have started to form on the tongue and the foetus starts to feel touch. The skeleton continues to develop and bones that form the skull begin to harden - but not fully. Antenatal checkup and scan to check the baby&acute;s position. A baby born this early does sometimes survive. A baby born at 24 weeks may possibly survive but it would have severe breathing difficulties as its lungs would not be strong enough to cope. It would also be very thin lightweight and susceptible to infections. All organs are now in place and the rest of the pregnancy is for growth. Preeclampsia is a risk from here onwards. This potentially fatal condition causes high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling caused by fluid retention. The causes are unclear but research suggests it may be linked to an immune reaction to the foetus or the placenta. If the condition is serious women may be advised to take drugs to lower their blood pressure and in some cases an early caesarean or induction may be performed. Serious complications of pregnancy The foetus skin is gradually becoming more opaque than transparent. The foetus measures about 34cm and weighs about 800g. Routine checkup to test for preeclampsia. Women with Rhesus negative blood will also be tested for antibodies. If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced.

Daniel Tuck, from Oldbury, West Midlands, is the first person to be successfully prosecuted under a new law preventing the sale of body parts. The 26-year-old tried to sell his kidney for £24,000 on a chatroom used by kidney disease sufferers. The judge suspended his sentence for two years and ordered him to pay £250. He had faced up to three years in jail for contravening the Human Tissue Act. I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Tuck had previous convictions for theft and obtaining property by deception. Judge Challinor said: "There is much public disquiet surrounding the sale of body parts for money and there is an understandable revulsion at such practices. "A sentence incorporating an element of deterrence is required." Helena Miller, prosecuting, said Tuck admitted a charge of offering to supply human material for transplantation last month. He had posted an advert on the internet which read: "I am a healthy 25-year-old male from Birmingham in England. I am blood group O+ and am desperate for funds to rebuild my life. "I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Why risk getting a kidney from a Third World country?" He was questioned by police after meeting a reporter from the Sunday Mercury newspaper in May 2006 and agreeing a price for the kidney, she said. During the meeting Tuck confirmed he knew the sale of organs in the United Kingdom was illegal. When he was arrested in June he told police he had recently split with his girlfriend and was £25,000 in debt. "He said he wasn't thinking straight," Ms Miller said. "He said he put the advert on the site to see what would happen." Jas Mann, defending, said his client had been a broken man at the time of the offence and did not intend to go through with his proposal. He said Tuck was gambling on a regular basis and "pumped" his earnings into fruit machines. A spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority, set up under the new Act to take action against organ trafficking, said: "It is an offence to give or receive a reward for the supply or offer of human material for transplantation." A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: "Any advertisement to sell human organs is a criminal offence and, where there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest, the CPS will prosecute these cases."

Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, said charities had to be wary of pharmaceutical donations. And he urged charities to question the cost of drugs more. But patient groups said there were strict guidelines covering such donations by the drugs industry. I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug Sir Michael Rawlins, of NICE Sir Michael said: "Patient organisations need to think very carefully about why pharmaceutical companies are giving them money and they have to make sure they are not beholden to a pharmaceutical company. "I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug. "When they do that they will come into their own." Sir Michael refused to name individual groups The subject of drug firm donations to patients groups and charities is a sensitive issue. Several groups, although not all, accept donations from drug firms. Most of those that do have codes of conduct setting out what those donations can and cannot be used for - most are restricted to funding education purposes than for campaigning. The Alzheimer's Society is involved in legal action along with Eisai and Pfizer against NICE over the decision to restrict the use of Alzheimer's treatments. The group has accepted money from both companies. But a spokeswoman pointed out that drug firm donations account for less than 1% of its income. She said the society's challenge was being done independently of the drug firms and added donations were never used to fund campaign activity. Breast Cancer Care, which pushed for NICE to approve the so-called breast cancer wonder-drug Herceptin, has received money from its maker Roche. A spokeswoman said any drug industry donations were always used for "impartial patient information". She added it was important there was a dialogue between patient groups and drug companies and she agreed cost was something that needed to be debated. "The cost of drug is clearly becoming a major factor in the potential for cancer treatment and must be addressed." And the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry denied there was anything wrong with such donations. "Patient groups and companies have a shared interest. When they work together it is in the patients' interests, usually to do with education programmes or disease awareness. "Any involvement has to be declared by the company so it is quite transparent."

The General Medical Council (GMC) ruled it had been an "exceptional" case that saw Essex-based Dr June Swinhoe fail in her practise. Marian Howland, 52, from Epping, had not been made aware of risks linked to her operation for a prolapse in 2003. The GMC panel ruled Dr Swinhoe posed no risk to patients. In March 2003, Dr Swinhoe was working as a consultant gynaecologist at King George Hospital in Ilford and privately at Holly House Hospital in Buckhurst Hill. I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily Mrs Howland had been married for eight years when she visited Dr Swinhoe with a prolapse and discomfort during sex. She told the panel she was admitted for the prolapse to be repaired but was not informed of all the side effects or of any risks associated with the procedures. Dr Swinhoe had not taken a full medical history from Mrs Howland who had previously had a hysterectomy, her ovaries removed and become blind in one eye. In tears, Mrs Howland told the panel a few weeks after the operation it became clear she had been left unable to have sex, and had been left "shell-shocked". She added: "I have lost my best friend, my husband, my lover. "I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily." The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care. "The finding that your fitness is impaired is, in itself, a very significant mark on your record. "You have learned from this distressing experience. "This is a wholly exceptional case and in the circumstances the panel is satisfied that it is fair, proportionate and sufficient to conclude the case without taking any action in respect of your registration."

Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces." A sample of the artificial blood prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics.

Jack Beaumont, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, is believed to be one of just 300 people in the world who have been diagnosed with melorheostosis. The disease, which causes excess bone growth, has left Jack with half the normal movement in his right arm. He was meeting experts at a national conference on melorheostosis in Oxford on Friday. Jack and fellow sufferers shared their stories at the UK Melorheostosis Conference. "I'm hoping for some answers and I'm looking forward to meeting some other people who've got the same disease as me," he said. His mother, Nicola Beaumont, added: "He just shrugs it off because he's so laid back, nothing affects him in that respect but I think as he gets older, he's going to find more restrictions."

The Royal Maternity Hospital closed the unit temporarily to new admissions after the babies became seriously ill. The ward has now been chemically decontaminated. Health Minister Michael McGimpsey said eliminating infections in hospitals was a priority. Dr Stanley Craig said the babies were responding well to antibiotics. "Any infection when you're particularly compromised, as a pre-term baby is, is potentially life-threatening," he said. "These babies are responding to the antibiotics that they're on, which is good news for the babies themselves, their parents and the staff involved in their care. The hospital hopes to re-open the unit next week "Being born premature does leave you very vulnerable to infection and it can be a problem, but we're seeing encouraging signs." The babies, who picked up a multi-resistant enterobacter infection, have been isolated and are being closely monitored by specially trained nurses. The health minister said the situation was not acceptable and pointed out there had been much investment in the area of patient safety. "It is one of the issues that we look at ...and it's one of the areas I take very, very seriously," said Mr McGimpsey. "Obviously when people go to hospital they expect not to pick up infection, when they're there. There is an incidence of infections in hospitals and we look to eliminate that because whatever the incidence is, it is ... too high." Iris Robinson of the DUP said she was concerned about the impact on other hospitals. "What I am particularly concerned about is how the other hospitals across the province are going to deal with demand while the Royal's neonatal unit is out of operation," she said. "Usually the most unwell babies from all around Northern Ireland would be transferred to the specialist unit in Belfast. "Obviously this will not be the case for the immediate future, and these cases will have to be managed in their local units."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6643547.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 UK E-mail this to a friend Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Aspirin could benefit high-risk groups, the study says Taking aspirin each day can prevent bowel cancer developing, a study says. Oxford University researchers said taking a dose of 300mg a day for five years offered the protection. Long-term aspirin use is generally not backed because of the risk of stomach problems, but the team said it could benefit those at high-risk of cancer. Cancer campaigners welcomed the study - published in the Lancet - which examined data from previous research covering more than 7,500 people. These findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. Each year, around 35,000 men and women in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer, and more than 16,000 die from the disease. The researchers looked at the results from two large-scale UK trials carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s covering over 7,500 people which had given some people 300, 500 or 1,200mg per day doses of aspirin or a dummy pill for five to seven years. The people in the study were then followed for up to 20 years, and deaths from bowel cancer were logged. The team say it takes at least 10 years to see an effect, because that is how long it takes for a pre-cancerous growths to develop into cancer. Other studies have examined aspirin's benefits. However, this was the first where people were allocated to take different doses of the drug, or the fake version, rather than looking back at the aspirin use of bowel cancer patients and comparing them with healthy people. High risk group 'benefit' The researchers found that taking 300mg of aspirin - the equivalent of one pill - a day for five years reduced the incidence of bowel cancer by 74% in the subsequent 10 to 15 years. An accompanying review of 30 observational studies suggested taking medium-to-high doses of aspirin for 10 years or more reduced the risk of developing the disease by 50%-70%. The protective effect of aspirin appeared to be consistent regardless of age, sex, race or country of origin. It was also seen in individuals who had a close family relative with bowel cancer, which normally raises the lifetime risk two to four times. Professor Peter Rothwell, who led the research, said: "What we are saying is that for a subgroup of people at high risk of bowel cancer, they probably aren't going to be dramatically harmed by taking aspirin. "They may have some risk of bleeding in the stomach, but they will see potentially significant benefits in the reduction of their colon cancer risk. "In that situation, I think taking aspirin daily would be worthwhile." Dr Andrew Chan, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, writing in the Lancet, said the findings were "convincing evidence" that aspirin can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer. But he added: "With the concerns about the potential risks of long-term aspirin use and the availability of alternative prevention strategies - such as screening - these findings are not sufficient to warrant a recommendation for the general population to use aspirin for cancer prevention." Rob Glynne-Jones, chief medical advisor to the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: "This is very interesting and it certainly confirms what we already know and believe about the links between aspirin, polyps and the development of bowel cancer. "However, these findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. "Aspirin at this dose over a prolonged period of time could lead to potentially serious side effects in a few people."

Professor Louis Appleby has called on NHS trusts to look at new ways of working to help people rebuild lives. He said they should look to work more closely with employment and housing agencies and cut waiting lists for talking therapies in England. Campaigners said there was a lot of work to do to ensure services were good enough for patients. In the last eight years, there has been a big push to move care out of hospitals and into the community. With units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk Marjorie Wallace, of Sane There are now more than 700 community teams, including nurses, doctors and social workers, providing a range of crisis help and early intervention. However, the Healthcare Commission last year criticised services, pointing to gaps in out-of-hours care, talking therapies and access to information. Nearly half of services were rated as fair or weak. Professor Appleby said the report was about the next phase of reform of mental health care. He told BBC News: "We've had several years of strengthening what community services do, and the report is about breaking down the barriers in the next stage of reforms. "I'm talking about barriers that get in the way of better patients' experience of care "At the moment, for example, there is a barrier between what health services traditionally do, which is clinical care, improving people's illnesses, abolishing their symptoms. "But what patients often tell us they want is help with quality of life. They want opportunities for training, for jobs, and for decent housing, and we have to take on that responsibility." His report called on the 60 mental heath trusts to consult with their local populations about what they needed. The report said mental health trusts should look at ways they could link up with agencies responsible for housing and employment. It also called for community teams to get involved in giving people more advice on how to reduce alcohol and drug use and look after their physical health. He also called for a renewed effort to reduce waiting lists for talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which sometimes has waits of over 12 months. The NHS is currently rolling out a programme of providing people with access to computerised CBT and the government has set up 10 pilots to explore ways of speeding up access to talking therapies. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said extra investment was needed. "We are all too aware that with units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk. "The government goes forward with its policy of reform and choice, but there are thousands who have no choice of where to go in crisis and little chance of rehabilitation or safe, consistent care, both in or out of hospital."

However, patients may find problems getting Avastin, as the NHS drugs watchdogs have yet to consider whether to sanction its use. The drug is designed to be used in tandem with another chemotherapy agent, paclitaxel. Avastin, which works by starving cancer cells of a blood supply, has previously been used to treat bowel cancer. All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options However, the drug was rejected for NHS use in England and Wales for that purpose last year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that it was not cost-effective. In trials, breast cancer patients who took Avastin and paclitaxel went an average of 13 months without their cancer growing, compared with an average of 6.7 months for patients who took paclitaxel alone. Professor David Miles, a consultant medical oncologist at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Middlesex, said: "This provides some hope for the 13,000 patients a year that are told the devastating news they have metastatic breast cancer which cannot be cured with surgery. "It is an important step forward to have discovered another targeted treatment which can inhibit the growth of breast cancer and as a result increase significantly the time that patients' breast cancer is controlled." Dr Emma Pennery, a nurse consultant at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said women with secondary breast cancer would welcome any treatment that could potentially slow down the progression of their disease. "This announcement means that there is now another treatment option available, adding to the growing range of targeted drugs for breast cancer." Dr Pennery called on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium to appraise the drug as soon as possible. Dr Sarah Rawlings, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "The development of targeted therapies like this is an important step forward in cancer treatment. "Avastin is an additional treatment option that will be welcomed by women with metastatic breast cancer, although it's important to remember it might not be suitable for everyone. "All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options. "Any woman concerned should discuss this with her doctor."

The Australian team has used nanotechnology to create tiny particles which specifically attack cancer cells, but leave healthy tissue unaffected. The particles - or mini-cells - are tagged with anti-cancer antibodies so they zero in on their target. The research features in the journal Cancer Cell. There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel It is hoped the technique could treat tumours in the breast, ovaries, colon and lungs. So far it has been used in mice and dogs, and the researchers plan to begin human trials shortly. Traditional chemotherapy typically involves subjecting the patient's entire body to powerful drugs, which can cause a range of severe side-effects. The mini-cells - about one-fifth the size of a normal cell - were created from bacteria cells stripped of their reproductive powers. They were then loaded with cancer drugs, and tagged with antibodies which are attracted to cancerous tumours. Once the cell reaches the cancer, the drug is released directly into the malignant growth. Researcher Jennifer MacDiarmid, from Sydney-based biotechnology company EnGeneIC, said: "There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel." In tests, the technique reduced tumours in animals without side effects - and by using only a very small amount of drug. Dr MacDiarmid said the treatment could potentially be used on any solid tumours. She said the technique potentially paved the way for customised drug cocktails for individual patients. Professor Quentin Pankhurst, of the London Centre for Nanotechnology, said: "The concept of targeted drug delivery is something which has been around for a while and there are many different avenues that have been tested. "This one looks like an interesting and promising one. "I particularly like the fact that these mini-cells, as they call them, seem to be swallowed up by the cancer cells and taken inside the cancer cells, because that is inherently a very powerful way to actually deliver the drug - actually into the cell."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/hi/english/static/in_depth/health/2000/heart_disease/default.stm	BBC News | Health | Heart Disease The UK has one of the highest rates of death from heart disease in the world - one British adult dies from the disease every three minutes - and stroke is the country's third biggest killer, claiming 70,000 lives each year. Heart attacks occur when blood flow is blocked, often by a blood clot, while strokes are caused either by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain. A range of other conditions, including heart failure, when blood is not pumped properly around the body, and congenital heart defects can also cause long term problems, and even death, for sufferers. - The blood returns from the lungs to the upper left chamber of the heart where it is again briefly stored until the atrium fills, before flowing on to the left ventricle. - Impure or blue blood returning from the atrium enters the heart here, where it is held until the atrium - or chamber - fills up. - This is the most powerful chamber of the heart. It pumps the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta, or main artery. - This powerful pump propels blood into the pulmonary artery, the tube which carries blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide in the blood is removed and oxygen added.

In the UK pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last period so for as much as three weeks of this first month she might not be actually pregnant. When fertilisation does occur the tiny mass of cells called a blastocyst at this stage embeds itself in the lining of the womb which is already thickening to support it. The mass of cells is developing fast and becomes an embryo. For many women the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Shopbought tests are considered largely reliable so the mother-to-be does not have to have her pregnancy confirmed by her GP. If a first test is negative a second one a few days later may prove positive as hormone levels in the urine rise. The embryo officially becomes a foetus. It is about the size of a baked bean and its spine and nervous system begin to form. The foetus already has its own blood system and may be a different blood group from its mother. Blood vessels are forming in what will become the umbilical cord and tiny buds which will become limbs appear. The baby&acute;s heart is beginning to develop. Morning sickness and other side effects of early pregnancy may take hold. Around this time many women find they experience the side-effects of early pregnancy including needing to urinate more often nausea and vomiting and feeling a bit weepy and irritable. All medication including supplements need to be carefully checked as the foetus is undergoing vital development in the first 12 weeks. If the woman has not told her GP or community midwife she is pregnant yet now is a good time to do so. It is quite common to have a first scan at this stage if the woman has had a previous miscarriage or bleeding. An early scan is often done through the vagina and is used to check the pregnancy is not ectopic. It should show up the baby&acute;s heartbeat. The nervous system is also developing rapidly especially the brain. The head gets bigger and eyes form under the skin of the face. The foetus' limbs are growing and look more like arms and legs. All internal organs are developing and becoming more complex. The foetus is about 5cm long with its head tucked onto its chest. It has most its major organs and eyes and ears are developing. A scan at 10-13 weeks is recommended to pin down the date of the pregnancy. The umbilical cord is fully formed providing nourishment and removing waste products. The foetus looks fully human now. By this week the threat of miscarriage is much reduced. Many women announce their pregnancy to friends and colleagues. The foetus is growing in length much more quickly by now it is about eight cm long and weighs about 60 grams. The placenta is now wellformed though it's not yet doing its full job it takes over fully in week 14. The mother is likely to have her first scan this week. The womans uterus is becoming larger and is starting to rise out of the pelvis. The foetus can move its head quite easily. Third of the way through. The average pregnancy lasts 266 days or 280 days from the first day of last period. Screening for Downs syndrome is offered about now. A simple blood test is carried out first then further tests may be offered. On the basis of the blood test results the woman may opt for a Chorionic Villus sample or an amniocentesis which would diagnose or other chromosomal abnormalities. However these diagnostic tests have a small risk of subsequent miscarriage. An alternative to blood tests is a nuchal translucency scan a new scan offered by some larger hospitals. But again an amniocentisis would be required for firm diagnosis. The foetus now has toe and finger nails eyebrows and eyelashes. It is also covered with downy hair. The hair that will cover the baby until the last week or so of pregnancy - called lanugo - starts to form. This hair is very fine more like down and it probably serves as some form of insulation and protection for the skin. The foetus can hear noises from the outside world. By this stage the mother is visibly pregnant and the uterus is rising. By this stage the foetus is moving around a lot - probably enough to be felt. The foetus is now about 15-20cm long and weighs about 300g. Milk teeth have formed in the gums. Half way through pregnancy now. Almost all mothers are offered a routine scan. The foetus develops a waxy coating called vernix. The scan can show the foetus in fine detail and often reveal if the baby is a boy or a girl. However not all hospitals offer to tell parents the sex of the child - and not all parents want to know. The mother may feel short of breath as her uterus pushes against her diaphragm leaving less space for the lungs. The mother may be offered another ultrasound scan around this time. The scan can check the baby&acute;s spine internal organs and growth are normal. Senses develop: taste buds have started to form on the tongue and the foetus starts to feel touch. The skeleton continues to develop and bones that form the skull begin to harden - but not fully. Antenatal checkup and scan to check the baby&acute;s position. A baby born this early does sometimes survive. A baby born at 24 weeks may possibly survive but it would have severe breathing difficulties as its lungs would not be strong enough to cope. It would also be very thin lightweight and susceptible to infections. All organs are now in place and the rest of the pregnancy is for growth. Preeclampsia is a risk from here onwards. This potentially fatal condition causes high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling caused by fluid retention. The causes are unclear but research suggests it may be linked to an immune reaction to the foetus or the placenta. If the condition is serious women may be advised to take drugs to lower their blood pressure and in some cases an early caesarean or induction may be performed. Serious complications of pregnancy The foetus skin is gradually becoming more opaque than transparent. The foetus measures about 34cm and weighs about 800g. Routine checkup to test for preeclampsia. Women with Rhesus negative blood will also be tested for antibodies. If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced.

"It is one of the issues that we look at ...and it's one of the areas I take very, very seriously," said Mr McGimpsey. "Obviously when people go to hospital they expect not to pick up infection, when they're there. There is an incidence of infections in hospitals and we look to eliminate that because whatever the incidence is, it is ... too high." Iris Robinson of the DUP said she was concerned about the impact on other hospitals. "What I am particularly concerned about is how the other hospitals across the province are going to deal with demand while the Royal's neonatal unit is out of operation," she said. "Usually the most unwell babies from all around Northern Ireland would be transferred to the specialist unit in Belfast. "Obviously this will not be the case for the immediate future, and these cases will have to be managed in their local units."

Modified to have a attribute for better module consistency. to allow specifying categorization scheme. for a human readable label. element for media binary hashing. to distinguish formatting of text. Improved descriptions of various elements and attributes. 08/22/2005 - Improved global syndication capabilities: [1.1.0] attributes to media:text and media:content. to give more flexibility to represent things other than people or companies. to explicitly determine what type of media is expressed. Added a "Best Practices" section to encourage use of the Feed History module, and Dublin Core's expiration capability. Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object.

This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use.

This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module.

Professor Louis Appleby has called on NHS trusts to look at new ways of working to help people rebuild lives. He said they should look to work more closely with employment and housing agencies and cut waiting lists for talking therapies in England. Campaigners said there was a lot of work to do to ensure services were good enough for patients. In the last eight years, there has been a big push to move care out of hospitals and into the community. With units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk Marjorie Wallace, of Sane There are now more than 700 community teams, including nurses, doctors and social workers, providing a range of crisis help and early intervention. However, the Healthcare Commission last year criticised services, pointing to gaps in out-of-hours care, talking therapies and access to information. Nearly half of services were rated as fair or weak. Professor Appleby said the report was about the next phase of reform of mental health care. He told BBC News: "We've had several years of strengthening what community services do, and the report is about breaking down the barriers in the next stage of reforms. "I'm talking about barriers that get in the way of better patients' experience of care "At the moment, for example, there is a barrier between what health services traditionally do, which is clinical care, improving people's illnesses, abolishing their symptoms. "But what patients often tell us they want is help with quality of life. They want opportunities for training, for jobs, and for decent housing, and we have to take on that responsibility." His report called on the 60 mental heath trusts to consult with their local populations about what they needed. The report said mental health trusts should look at ways they could link up with agencies responsible for housing and employment. It also called for community teams to get involved in giving people more advice on how to reduce alcohol and drug use and look after their physical health. He also called for a renewed effort to reduce waiting lists for talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which sometimes has waits of over 12 months. The NHS is currently rolling out a programme of providing people with access to computerised CBT and the government has set up 10 pilots to explore ways of speeding up access to talking therapies. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said extra investment was needed. "We are all too aware that with units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk. "The government goes forward with its policy of reform and choice, but there are thousands who have no choice of where to go in crisis and little chance of rehabilitation or safe, consistent care, both in or out of hospital."

The disease tends to affect older people - but can strike at any time. Excluding certain skin cancers, there were more than 270,000 new cases of the disease in 2001 - and the rate is increasing by about 1% a year. Some cancer, such as breast, are becoming more common, while new cases of lung cancer fall away due to the drop in the number of smokers. However, while the overall number of new cancers is not falling, the good news is that successful treatment rates for many of the most common types are improving rapidly.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6648059.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Experts back folic acid in flour Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 17:03 GMT 18:03 UK E-mail this to a friend Experts back folic acid in flour Under the plan, all bread would be made with folic acid-fortified flour The UK's official food watchdog is backing the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid to reduce birth defects such as spina bifida. The proposal will go before the board of the Food Standards Agency next week for ratification. If passed, ministers will then decide whether to press ahead. Scientific research shows that folic acid significantly cuts the risk of neural tube defects, which affect up to 900 pregnancies a year in the UK. However, there is concern that adding the vitamin to flour could harm some elderly patients, as it could mask a deficiency in the B12 vitamin. Up to 10% of those aged 65 and older have borderline B12 levels and could tip into deficiency. In extreme cases, this can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system. The recommendation to the FSA board suggests that products containing folic acid at nutritionally significant levels should be clearly labelled. It also argues that mandatory fortification should be accompanied by new controls on the voluntary addition of folic acid to other products, such as breakfast cereals and low-fat spreads, and on the use of folic acid supplements. A system for monitoring the health impact of fortification would also be needed. Wholemeal flour would be exempt from fortification in order to give consumers more choice. The FSA already advises women to eat extra folic acid when trying to get pregnant. However, research suggests that only half of such women adhere to this advice. Also, up to half of pregnancies are unplanned, meaning women may miss the opportunity. Each year between 500 and 600 babies in the UK are reported to have neural tube defects. It is thought many of the other affected pregnancies are terminated. Mandatory fortification has already been introduced in the USA, Canada and Chile, where it cut NTD rates by between 27% and 50%. A panel of UK experts, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), last year backed mandatory fortification of flour. SACN found no evidence that vitamin B12 deficiency was masked in older people, provided folic acid doses were 1mg a day or less. An FSA consultation on the issue drew 202 responses from industry, consumer groups and individuals. The baking industry raised "practical concerns" about the fortification of bread. It said bread-making flour couldn't easily be separated from other flours in mills.

Half of children enter primary school unable to speak as well as they are expected to, research suggests. The Early Talk programme which uses gestures, symbols and signing to expand vocabulary, is being piloted in 200 government-backed children's centres. It will also be used to target youngsters with potential difficulties. Television doesn't respond well to children. ICAN head of Early Years Clare Geldard, head of Early Years for the charity behind the programme, I CAN, said there were concerns that the number of pre-school children with speech and language difficulties was on the rise. "We don't know why this is the case and I am sure there are a myriad of reasons. "We know that television can be used in a really productive way in terms of watching a piece of television and then having a conversation about it afterwards, but we also know that television doesn't respond well to children. "It does not give them the interactivity that children and adults instinctively seek from adults." She said the Early Talk programme was about ensuring that nursery staff, childminders and parents had the basic skills they needed to enhance children's speech, language and communication. "Everybody needs to have a basic knowledge about what we can do to enhance children's speech and language development," she said. But it was also about ensuring that those children who had the potential to go on to develop speech and language difficulties were picked up early and given the help they need. I CAN's chief executive Virginia Beardshaw said one in 10 children across the UK were thought to have a communication disability. She added that the Early Talk programme, which will ultimately be rolled out to 3,000 Sure Start children's centres, would foster environments "where communication is embedded". This would range from using pictures, symbols and gestures to teach vocabulary to using group work and specialist help from speech and language therapists, she said. Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: "Communication is a vital skill in life and we want to help all children communicate better and reap the rewards of that later in life. "This is especially important for children who have trouble communicating - particularly those with a communication disability - who are much more likely to develop behavioural and learning problems." She said she hoped the partnership being announced would play a vital role in identifying children's difficulties at an early stage. Nursery and children's centre staff will be given training and packages of support to help ensure children's language skills are polished and it is hoped this will be passed on to parents and children's carers.

The Australian team has used nanotechnology to create tiny particles which specifically attack cancer cells, but leave healthy tissue unaffected. The particles - or mini-cells - are tagged with anti-cancer antibodies so they zero in on their target. The research features in the journal Cancer Cell. There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel It is hoped the technique could treat tumours in the breast, ovaries, colon and lungs. So far it has been used in mice and dogs, and the researchers plan to begin human trials shortly. Traditional chemotherapy typically involves subjecting the patient's entire body to powerful drugs, which can cause a range of severe side-effects. The mini-cells - about one-fifth the size of a normal cell - were created from bacteria cells stripped of their reproductive powers. They were then loaded with cancer drugs, and tagged with antibodies which are attracted to cancerous tumours. Once the cell reaches the cancer, the drug is released directly into the malignant growth. Researcher Jennifer MacDiarmid, from Sydney-based biotechnology company EnGeneIC, said: "There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel." In tests, the technique reduced tumours in animals without side effects - and by using only a very small amount of drug. Dr MacDiarmid said the treatment could potentially be used on any solid tumours. She said the technique potentially paved the way for customised drug cocktails for individual patients. Professor Quentin Pankhurst, of the London Centre for Nanotechnology, said: "The concept of targeted drug delivery is something which has been around for a while and there are many different avenues that have been tested. "This one looks like an interesting and promising one. "I particularly like the fact that these mini-cells, as they call them, seem to be swallowed up by the cancer cells and taken inside the cancer cells, because that is inherently a very powerful way to actually deliver the drug - actually into the cell."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/essex/6644841.stm	BBC NEWS | England | Essex | Gynaecologist lacked op consent Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 20:02 GMT 21:02 UK E-mail this to a friend Gynaecologist lacked op consent The General Medical Council said the case was "wholly exceptional" A gynaecologist who failed to obtain consent from a woman for an operation which left her unable to have sex has not been struck off. The General Medical Council (GMC) ruled it had been an "exceptional" case that saw Essex-based Dr June Swinhoe fail in her practise. Marian Howland, 52, from Epping, had not been made aware of risks linked to her operation for a prolapse in 2003. The GMC panel ruled Dr Swinhoe posed no risk to patients. In March 2003, Dr Swinhoe was working as a consultant gynaecologist at King George Hospital in Ilford and privately at Holly House Hospital in Buckhurst Hill. I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily Mrs Howland had been married for eight years when she visited Dr Swinhoe with a prolapse and discomfort during sex. She told the panel she was admitted for the prolapse to be repaired but was not informed of all the side effects or of any risks associated with the procedures. Dr Swinhoe had not taken a full medical history from Mrs Howland who had previously had a hysterectomy, her ovaries removed and become blind in one eye. In tears, Mrs Howland told the panel a few weeks after the operation it became clear she had been left unable to have sex, and had been left "shell-shocked". She added: "I have lost my best friend, my husband, my lover. "I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily." The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care.

HPV infection was found to be a much stronger risk factor than tobacco or alcohol use, the Johns Hopkins University study of 300 people found. The New England Journal of Medicine study said the risk was almost nine times higher for people who reported oral sex with more than six partners. But experts said a larger study was needed to confirm the findings. HPV infection is the cause of the majority of cervical cancers, and 80% of sexually active women can expect to have an HPV infection at some point in their lives. It is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza, study author The Johns Hopkins study took blood and saliva from 100 men and women newly diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer which affects the throat, tonsils and back of the tongue. They also asked questions about sex practices and other risk factors for the disease, such as family history. Those who had evidence of prior oral HPV infection had a 32-fold increased risk of throat cancer. HPV16 - one of the most common cancer-causing strains of the virus - was present in the tumours of 72% of cancer patients in the study. There was no added risk for people infected with HPV who also smoked and drank alcohol, suggesting the virus itself is driving the risk of the cancer. Oral sex was said to be the main mode of transmission of HPV but the researchers said mouth-to-mouth transmission, for example through kissing, could not be ruled out. Most HPV infections clear with little or no symptoms but a small percentage of people who acquired high-risk strains may develop a cancer, the researchers added. Study author Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza said: "It is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer." Co-researcher Dr Maura Gillison said previous research by the team had suggested there was a strong link. But she added: "People should be reassured that oropharyngeal cancer is relatively uncommon and the overwhelming majority of people with an oral HPV infection probably will not get throat cancer." A vaccine which protects against cervical cancer caused by HPV strains 6, 11, 16 and 18, and also against genital warts is available and the researchers said the study provided a rationale for vaccinating both girls and boys. But whether the vaccine would protect against oral HPV infection is not yet known. Dr Julie Sharp, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: "There is conflicting evidence about the role of HPV, and this rare type of mouth cancer. "As this was a small study, further research is needed to confirm these observations." "We know that after age, the main causes of mouth cancer are smoking or chewing tobacco or betel nut, and drinking too much alcohol."

Half of children enter primary school unable to speak as well as they are expected to, research suggests. The Early Talk programme which uses gestures, symbols and signing to expand vocabulary, is being piloted in 200 government-backed children's centres. It will also be used to target youngsters with potential difficulties. Television doesn't respond well to children. ICAN head of Early Years Clare Geldard, head of Early Years for the charity behind the programme, I CAN, said there were concerns that the number of pre-school children with speech and language difficulties was on the rise. "We don't know why this is the case and I am sure there are a myriad of reasons. "We know that television can be used in a really productive way in terms of watching a piece of television and then having a conversation about it afterwards, but we also know that television doesn't respond well to children. "It does not give them the interactivity that children and adults instinctively seek from adults." She said the Early Talk programme was about ensuring that nursery staff, childminders and parents had the basic skills they needed to enhance children's speech, language and communication. "Everybody needs to have a basic knowledge about what we can do to enhance children's speech and language development," she said. But it was also about ensuring that those children who had the potential to go on to develop speech and language difficulties were picked up early and given the help they need. I CAN's chief executive Virginia Beardshaw said one in 10 children across the UK were thought to have a communication disability. She added that the Early Talk programme, which will ultimately be rolled out to 3,000 Sure Start children's centres, would foster environments "where communication is embedded". This would range from using pictures, symbols and gestures to teach vocabulary to using group work and specialist help from speech and language therapists, she said. Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: "Communication is a vital skill in life and we want to help all children communicate better and reap the rewards of that later in life. "This is especially important for children who have trouble communicating - particularly those with a communication disability - who are much more likely to develop behavioural and learning problems." She said she hoped the partnership being announced would play a vital role in identifying children's difficulties at an early stage. Nursery and children's centre staff will be given training and packages of support to help ensure children's language skills are polished and it is hoped this will be passed on to parents and children's carers.

However, patients may find problems getting Avastin, as the NHS drugs watchdogs have yet to consider whether to sanction its use. The drug is designed to be used in tandem with another chemotherapy agent, paclitaxel. Avastin, which works by starving cancer cells of a blood supply, has previously been used to treat bowel cancer. All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options However, the drug was rejected for NHS use in England and Wales for that purpose last year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that it was not cost-effective. In trials, breast cancer patients who took Avastin and paclitaxel went an average of 13 months without their cancer growing, compared with an average of 6.7 months for patients who took paclitaxel alone. Professor David Miles, a consultant medical oncologist at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Middlesex, said: "This provides some hope for the 13,000 patients a year that are told the devastating news they have metastatic breast cancer which cannot be cured with surgery. "It is an important step forward to have discovered another targeted treatment which can inhibit the growth of breast cancer and as a result increase significantly the time that patients' breast cancer is controlled." Dr Emma Pennery, a nurse consultant at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said women with secondary breast cancer would welcome any treatment that could potentially slow down the progression of their disease. "This announcement means that there is now another treatment option available, adding to the growing range of targeted drugs for breast cancer." Dr Pennery called on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium to appraise the drug as soon as possible. Dr Sarah Rawlings, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "The development of targeted therapies like this is an important step forward in cancer treatment. "Avastin is an additional treatment option that will be welcomed by women with metastatic breast cancer, although it's important to remember it might not be suitable for everyone. "All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/health/2000/heart_disease/default.stm	BBC News | Health | Heart Disease The UK has one of the highest rates of death from heart disease in the world - one British adult dies from the disease every three minutes - and stroke is the country's third biggest killer, claiming 70,000 lives each year. Heart attacks occur when blood flow is blocked, often by a blood clot, while strokes are caused either by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain. A range of other conditions, including heart failure, when blood is not pumped properly around the body, and congenital heart defects can also cause long term problems, and even death, for sufferers. - The blood returns from the lungs to the upper left chamber of the heart where it is again briefly stored until the atrium fills, before flowing on to the left ventricle. - Impure or blue blood returning from the atrium enters the heart here, where it is held until the atrium - or chamber - fills up. - This is the most powerful chamber of the heart. It pumps the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta, or main artery. - This powerful pump propels blood into the pulmonary artery, the tube which carries blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide in the blood is removed and oxygen added.

The study also said that parents who do not want their children to drink behind their backs should limit their pocket money to less than £10 a week. The study, led by Liverpool John Moores University, was based on responses from more than 10,000 15 and 16-year-olds. Almost 90% admitted to drinking alcohol, of which 38% binged, 24% drank frequently and 50% drank in public. Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol Liverpool John Moores University The study also found a third of respondents bought their own alcohol, and those that did were six times more likely to drink in public, and twice as likely to binge than those who had alcohol bought for them. Last month the charity Alcohol Concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted following figures suggesting a large increase in alcohol consumption by 11 to 13-year-olds. But the latest study, published in the journal Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy, questions this approach. Lead researcher Dr Mark Bellis said figures suggested that 75% of 14-year-olds had tried alcohol. "The question is: are they learning to drink from their parents in a socially responsible environment, or are they learning behind some bushes in the park, or in a bar where they should not be in the first place? "The chances are if they are in the latter position they are learning to binge drink, they are hiding their drinking, they can't talk to their parents about it. "Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol, and how to consume in moderation." Dr Bellis said criminalising a parent for allowing a child to drink was probably not going to help any family. Frank Soodeen, campaigns officer for Alcohol Concern, said the charity had taken its lead from the law, which prohibits under-15s from being served alcohol in public places. He agreed that it was appropriate for parents to allow drinking in the home for older teenagers - but reiterated the charity's view that younger teenagers should not be encouraged to drink. He said: "We agree that parents have a real role to play in raising socially responsible drinkers." The researchers say that increasing the cost of alcohol, and closing down retailers who sell to underage drinkers could help tackle the problem.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6643547.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 UK E-mail this to a friend Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Aspirin could benefit high-risk groups, the study says Taking aspirin each day can prevent bowel cancer developing, a study says. Oxford University researchers said taking a dose of 300mg a day for five years offered the protection. Long-term aspirin use is generally not backed because of the risk of stomach problems, but the team said it could benefit those at high-risk of cancer. Cancer campaigners welcomed the study - published in the Lancet - which examined data from previous research covering more than 7,500 people. These findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. Each year, around 35,000 men and women in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer, and more than 16,000 die from the disease. The researchers looked at the results from two large-scale UK trials carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s covering over 7,500 people which had given some people 300, 500 or 1,200mg per day doses of aspirin or a dummy pill for five to seven years. The people in the study were then followed for up to 20 years, and deaths from bowel cancer were logged. The team say it takes at least 10 years to see an effect, because that is how long it takes for a pre-cancerous growths to develop into cancer. Other studies have examined aspirin's benefits. However, this was the first where people were allocated to take different doses of the drug, or the fake version, rather than looking back at the aspirin use of bowel cancer patients and comparing them with healthy people. High risk group 'benefit' The researchers found that taking 300mg of aspirin - the equivalent of one pill - a day for five years reduced the incidence of bowel cancer by 74% in the subsequent 10 to 15 years. An accompanying review of 30 observational studies suggested taking medium-to-high doses of aspirin for 10 years or more reduced the risk of developing the disease by 50%-70%. The protective effect of aspirin appeared to be consistent regardless of age, sex, race or country of origin. It was also seen in individuals who had a close family relative with bowel cancer, which normally raises the lifetime risk two to four times. Professor Peter Rothwell, who led the research, said: "What we are saying is that for a subgroup of people at high risk of bowel cancer, they probably aren't going to be dramatically harmed by taking aspirin. "They may have some risk of bleeding in the stomach, but they will see potentially significant benefits in the reduction of their colon cancer risk. "In that situation, I think taking aspirin daily would be worthwhile." Dr Andrew Chan, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, writing in the Lancet, said the findings were "convincing evidence" that aspirin can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer. But he added: "With the concerns about the potential risks of long-term aspirin use and the availability of alternative prevention strategies - such as screening - these findings are not sufficient to warrant a recommendation for the general population to use aspirin for cancer prevention." Rob Glynne-Jones, chief medical advisor to the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: "This is very interesting and it certainly confirms what we already know and believe about the links between aspirin, polyps and the development of bowel cancer. "However, these findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. "Aspirin at this dose over a prolonged period of time could lead to potentially serious side effects in a few people."

Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces." A sample of the artificial blood prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics.

It follows a huge rise in cases of Lyme Disease in Scotland and encephalitis amongst travellers to mainland Europe, spread by ticks. Both infections are severely debilitating and can be fatal. A decade ago there were just 10 cases of Lyme Disease in Scotland, but last year that figure had risen to 177. In mainland Europe, tick-borne encephalitis is also on the rise and is now endemic in 27 countries. Make sure you know about bite prevention, how to look out for the early symptoms and remember to seek advice The advice to anyone heading into the countryside is to wear insect repellent and long trousers if possible and to check themselves thoroughly afterwards. Ticks should be removed by gripping them close to the skin with tweezers and pulling backwards without jerking or twisting. They are common in woodland, heath land and in particular areas in Scotland where deer graze. More recently they have also been found in urban parks. A spokesman for the Tick Alert campaign said: "Ticks are second only to mosquitoes for carrying disease to humans. "Travellers and holidaymakers visiting rural areas are at risk from tick bites, but also when spending time in public spaces including beer gardens, picnic spots and parks and gardens. "Make sure you know about bite prevention, how to look out for the early symptoms and remember to seek advice well before your travel date." Wear trousers tucked into socks Check warm folds of the skin Carefully remove with tweezers Do not try to drown in Vaseline Be aware of favoured habitats Lyme disease varies widely but can include a rash and flu-like symptoms in its initial stage, followed by the possibility of musculoskeletal, arthritic, neurological, psychiatric and cardiac problems. Most cases of Lyme disease can be cured with antibiotics, especially if treatment is begun early in the course of illness. Katrina Anderson, from Edinburgh, became ill after she was bitten by a tick in 1991. She was misdiagnosed by her GP who blamed ME for her chronic fatigue and it took another two years before she was told by a specialist that she had contracted Lyme disease. Ms Anderson said: "At the time I was actually very ill. I became very flu-like with muscle pains, constant headaches. "It was like having a virus. It's like a hidden illness. You don't actually see what the person is suffering from. "It can affect all aspects of your nervous system."

The study also said that parents who do not want their children to drink behind their backs should limit their pocket money to less than £10 a week. The study, led by Liverpool John Moores University, was based on responses from more than 10,000 15 and 16-year-olds. Almost 90% admitted to drinking alcohol, of which 38% binged, 24% drank frequently and 50% drank in public. Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol Liverpool John Moores University The study also found a third of respondents bought their own alcohol, and those that did were six times more likely to drink in public, and twice as likely to binge than those who had alcohol bought for them. Last month the charity Alcohol Concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted following figures suggesting a large increase in alcohol consumption by 11 to 13-year-olds. But the latest study, published in the journal Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy, questions this approach. Lead researcher Dr Mark Bellis said figures suggested that 75% of 14-year-olds had tried alcohol. "The question is: are they learning to drink from their parents in a socially responsible environment, or are they learning behind some bushes in the park, or in a bar where they should not be in the first place? "The chances are if they are in the latter position they are learning to binge drink, they are hiding their drinking, they can't talk to their parents about it. "Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol, and how to consume in moderation." Dr Bellis said criminalising a parent for allowing a child to drink was probably not going to help any family. Frank Soodeen, campaigns officer for Alcohol Concern, said the charity had taken its lead from the law, which prohibits under-15s from being served alcohol in public places. He agreed that it was appropriate for parents to allow drinking in the home for older teenagers - but reiterated the charity's view that younger teenagers should not be encouraged to drink. He said: "We agree that parents have a real role to play in raising socially responsible drinkers." The researchers say that increasing the cost of alcohol, and closing down retailers who sell to underage drinkers could help tackle the problem.

Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, said charities had to be wary of pharmaceutical donations. And he urged charities to question the cost of drugs more. But patient groups said there were strict guidelines covering such donations by the drugs industry. I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug Sir Michael Rawlins, of NICE Sir Michael said: "Patient organisations need to think very carefully about why pharmaceutical companies are giving them money and they have to make sure they are not beholden to a pharmaceutical company. "I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug. "When they do that they will come into their own." Sir Michael refused to name individual groups The subject of drug firm donations to patients groups and charities is a sensitive issue. Several groups, although not all, accept donations from drug firms. Most of those that do have codes of conduct setting out what those donations can and cannot be used for - most are restricted to funding education purposes than for campaigning. The Alzheimer's Society is involved in legal action along with Eisai and Pfizer against NICE over the decision to restrict the use of Alzheimer's treatments. The group has accepted money from both companies. But a spokeswoman pointed out that drug firm donations account for less than 1% of its income. She said the society's challenge was being done independently of the drug firms and added donations were never used to fund campaign activity. Breast Cancer Care, which pushed for NICE to approve the so-called breast cancer wonder-drug Herceptin, has received money from its maker Roche. A spokeswoman said any drug industry donations were always used for "impartial patient information". She added it was important there was a dialogue between patient groups and drug companies and she agreed cost was something that needed to be debated. "The cost of drug is clearly becoming a major factor in the potential for cancer treatment and must be addressed." And the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry denied there was anything wrong with such donations. "Patient groups and companies have a shared interest. When they work together it is in the patients' interests, usually to do with education programmes or disease awareness. "Any involvement has to be declared by the company so it is quite transparent."

University officials are considering whether they should ban physiotherapy lecturers from using large exercise balls as chairs. Physiotherapists at the University of Bath say sitting on the balls while working at a desk encourages good posture and tones core muscles. Their professional body agrees that they are beneficial and carry no risk. But health and safety officials are concerned that the giant inflatables may be dangerous. A spokesman for the university said: "The university's health and safety team are looking into whether the balls meet the university's guidelines on conventional chairs to see if the trial can be allowed to become a permanent situation. We expect the result of this shortly." The balls are often used in gyms and are also known as Swiss balls because they were first used in Switzerland in the 1960s by therapists working with children with cerebral palsy. Physiotherapist Sonya Crowe from the university's Department for Health started a trend when she began using an exercise ball instead of a chair. Ms Crowe, who is the sports physiotherapist for the British beach volleyball team, said: "The balls are firm with a bit of give, so it is not difficult to balance on top of them, but the constant small movements you make whilst sitting at a desk are perfect for strengthening your core muscles. "You also have to sit upright, so they are perfect for improving posture. "In particular, people who suffer from back ache and shoulder pain can really benefit from sitting on an exercise ball instead of a regular office chair." She added: "I have never heard of anyone falling off one of the balls - and the health and safety benefits far outweigh any risks there may be." Ms Crowe's colleague Emily Richards said: "You couldn't miss the fact that Sonya was sat on a big squashy ball instead of an office chair. "A few of us tried it out and could see the benefit immediately. We put in a bulk order and now at least a dozen people around the university have got them." She added: "It seems to have started a real craze, and my husband has now got one at his work to help his bad back." The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy said there was no risk if the balls were used properly. One sports website warns that jewellery and belt buckles could burst the ball but says that most are made to deflate slowly rather than explode. The Health and Safety Executive said it was up to individual employers to decide how to meet their legal obligation to protect their staff.

The proposal will go before the board of the Food Standards Agency next week for ratification. If passed, ministers will then decide whether to press ahead. Scientific research shows that folic acid significantly cuts the risk of neural tube defects, which affect up to 900 pregnancies a year in the UK. However, there is concern that adding the vitamin to flour could harm some elderly patients, as it could mask a deficiency in the B12 vitamin. Up to 10% of those aged 65 and older have borderline B12 levels and could tip into deficiency. In extreme cases, this can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system. The recommendation to the FSA board suggests that products containing folic acid at nutritionally significant levels should be clearly labelled. It also argues that mandatory fortification should be accompanied by new controls on the voluntary addition of folic acid to other products, such as breakfast cereals and low-fat spreads, and on the use of folic acid supplements. A system for monitoring the health impact of fortification would also be needed. Wholemeal flour would be exempt from fortification in order to give consumers more choice. The FSA already advises women to eat extra folic acid when trying to get pregnant. However, research suggests that only half of such women adhere to this advice. Also, up to half of pregnancies are unplanned, meaning women may miss the opportunity. Each year between 500 and 600 babies in the UK are reported to have neural tube defects. It is thought many of the other affected pregnancies are terminated. Mandatory fortification has already been introduced in the USA, Canada and Chile, where it cut NTD rates by between 27% and 50%. A panel of UK experts, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), last year backed mandatory fortification of flour. SACN found no evidence that vitamin B12 deficiency was masked in older people, provided folic acid doses were 1mg a day or less. An FSA consultation on the issue drew 202 responses from industry, consumer groups and individuals. The baking industry raised "practical concerns" about the fortification of bread. It said bread-making flour couldn't easily be separated from other flours in mills.

Modified to have a attribute for better module consistency. to allow specifying categorization scheme. for a human readable label. element for media binary hashing. to distinguish formatting of text. Improved descriptions of various elements and attributes. 08/22/2005 - Improved global syndication capabilities: [1.1.0] attributes to media:text and media:content. to give more flexibility to represent things other than people or companies. to explicitly determine what type of media is expressed. Added a "Best Practices" section to encourage use of the Feed History module, and Dublin Core's expiration capability. Add time code information to 10/22/2005 - Minor improvements: [1.1.1] Added capability for elements to appear at the to allow explicit global relationships to be expressed. The namespace for Media RSS is defined to be: "Media RSS" is a new RSS module that supplements the enclosure capabilities of RSS 2.0. RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media. It contains 14 attributes, most of which are optional. should specify the direct url to the media object. If not included, a element must be specified. is the number of bytes of the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the standard MIME type of the object. It is an optional attribute. is the type of object (image | audio | video | document | executable). While this attribute can at times seem redundant if is supplied, it is included because it simplifies decision making on the reader side, as well as flushes out any ambiguities between MIME type and object type. It is an optional attribute. determines if this is the default object that should be used for the . There should only be one default object per . It is an optional attribute. determines if the object is a sample or the full version of the object, or even if it is a continuous stream (sample | full | nonstop). Default value is 'full'. It is an optional attribute. is the kilobits per second rate of media. It is an optional attribute. is the number of frames per second for the media object. It is an optional attribute. is the number of samples per second taken to create the media object. It is expressed in thousands of samples per second (kHz).

It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

It is an optional attribute. specifies the width of the thumbnail. It is an optional attribute. specifies the time offset in relation to the media object. Typically this is used when creating multiple keyframes within a single video. The format for this attribute should be in the DSM-CC's Normal Play Time (NTP) as used in RTSP [ RFC 2326 3.6 Normal Play Time ]. It is an optional attribute. NTP has a second or subsecond resolution. It is specified as H:M:S.h (npt-hhmmss) or S.h (npt-sec), where H=hours, M=minutes, S=second and h=fractions of a second. A possible alternative to NTP would be SMPTE. It is believed that NTP is simpler and easier to use.

It has 1 optional attribute. is the url for a terms of use page or additional copyright information. If the media is operating under a Creative Commons license, the Creative Commons module should be used instead. It is an optional attribute. Allows the inclusion of a text transcript, closed captioning, or lyrics of the media content. Many of these elements are permitted to provide a time series of text. In such cases, it is encouraged, but not required, that the elements be grouped by language and appear in time sequence order based on the time. Elements can have overlapping times. It has 4 optional attributes. Oh, say, can you see By the dawn's early light specifies the type of text embedded. Possible values are either 'plain' or 'html'. Default value is 'plain'. All html must be entity-encoded. It is an optional attribute. is the primary language encapsulated in the media object. Language codes possible are detailed in RFC 3066. This attribute is used similar to the xml:lang attribute detailed in the XML 1.0 Specification (Third Edition). It is an optional attribute. specifies the start time offset that the text starts being relevant to the media object. An example of this would be for closed captioning. It uses the NTP time code format (see: the time attribute used in ). It is an optional attribute. specifies the end time that the text is relevant. If this attribute is not provided, and a time is used, it is expected that the end time is either the end of the clip or the start of the next Allows restrictions to be placed on the aggregator rendering the media in the feed. Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated. To allow the producer to explicitly declare his/her intentions, two literals are reserved: 'all', 'none'. These literals can only be used once. This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module. A movie review with a trailer, using a Creative Commons license. My Movie Review Site Movie Title: Is this a good movie?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/4121411.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Pregnancy timeline Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 23 December, 2004, 13:42 GMT E-mail this to a friend Fertilisation occurs and a ball of quickly multiplying cells embeds itself in the lining of the uterus. In the UK pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last period so for as much as three weeks of this first month she might not be actually pregnant. When fertilisation does occur the tiny mass of cells called a blastocyst at this stage embeds itself in the lining of the womb which is already thickening to support it. The mass of cells is developing fast and becomes an embryo. For many women the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Shopbought tests are considered largely reliable so the mother-to-be does not have to have her pregnancy confirmed by her GP. If a first test is negative a second one a few days later may prove positive as hormone levels in the urine rise. The embryo officially becomes a foetus. It is about the size of a baked bean and its spine and nervous system begin to form. The foetus already has its own blood system and may be a different blood group from its mother. Blood vessels are forming in what will become the umbilical cord and tiny buds which will become limbs appear. The baby&acute;s heart is beginning to develop. Morning sickness and other side effects of early pregnancy may take hold. Around this time many women find they experience the side-effects of early pregnancy including needing to urinate more often nausea and vomiting and feeling a bit weepy and irritable. All medication including supplements need to be carefully checked as the foetus is undergoing vital development in the first 12 weeks. If the woman has not told her GP or community midwife she is pregnant yet now is a good time to do so. It is quite common to have a first scan at this stage if the woman has had a previous miscarriage or bleeding. An early scan is often done through the vagina and is used to check the pregnancy is not ectopic. It should show up the baby&acute;s heartbeat. The nervous system is also developing rapidly especially the brain. The head gets bigger and eyes form under the skin of the face. The foetus' limbs are growing and look more like arms and legs. All internal organs are developing and becoming more complex. The foetus is about 5cm long with its head tucked onto its chest. It has most its major organs and eyes and ears are developing. A scan at 10-13 weeks is recommended to pin down the date of the pregnancy. The umbilical cord is fully formed providing nourishment and removing waste products. The foetus looks fully human now. By this week the threat of miscarriage is much reduced. Many women announce their pregnancy to friends and colleagues. The foetus is growing in length much more quickly by now it is about eight cm long and weighs about 60 grams. The placenta is now wellformed though it's not yet doing its full job it takes over fully in week 14. The mother is likely to have her first scan this week. The womans uterus is becoming larger and is starting to rise out of the pelvis. The foetus can move its head quite easily. Third of the way through. The average pregnancy lasts 266 days or 280 days from the first day of last period. Screening for Downs syndrome is offered about now. A simple blood test is carried out first then further tests may be offered. On the basis of the blood test results the woman may opt for a Chorionic Villus sample or an amniocentesis which would diagnose or other chromosomal abnormalities. However these diagnostic tests have a small risk of subsequent miscarriage. An alternative to blood tests is a nuchal translucency scan a new scan offered by some larger hospitals. But again an amniocentisis would be required for firm diagnosis. The foetus now has toe and finger nails eyebrows and eyelashes. It is also covered with downy hair. The hair that will cover the baby until the last week or so of pregnancy - called lanugo - starts to form. This hair is very fine more like down and it probably serves as some form of insulation and protection for the skin. The foetus can hear noises from the outside world. By this stage the mother is visibly pregnant and the uterus is rising. By this stage the foetus is moving around a lot - probably enough to be felt. The foetus is now about 15-20cm long and weighs about 300g. Milk teeth have formed in the gums. Half way through pregnancy now. Almost all mothers are offered a routine scan. The foetus develops a waxy coating called vernix. The scan can show the foetus in fine detail and often reveal if the baby is a boy or a girl. However not all hospitals offer to tell parents the sex of the child - and not all parents want to know. The mother may feel short of breath as her uterus pushes against her diaphragm leaving less space for the lungs. The mother may be offered another ultrasound scan around this time. The scan can check the baby&acute;s spine internal organs and growth are normal. Senses develop: taste buds have started to form on the tongue and the foetus starts to feel touch. The skeleton continues to develop and bones that form the skull begin to harden - but not fully. Antenatal checkup and scan to check the baby&acute;s position. A baby born this early does sometimes survive. A baby born at 24 weeks may possibly survive but it would have severe breathing difficulties as its lungs would not be strong enough to cope. It would also be very thin lightweight and susceptible to infections. All organs are now in place and the rest of the pregnancy is for growth. Preeclampsia is a risk from here onwards. This potentially fatal condition causes high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling caused by fluid retention. The causes are unclear but research suggests it may be linked to an immune reaction to the foetus or the placenta. If the condition is serious women may be advised to take drugs to lower their blood pressure and in some cases an early caesarean or induction may be performed. Serious complications of pregnancy The foetus skin is gradually becoming more opaque than transparent. The foetus measures about 34cm and weighs about 800g. Routine checkup to test for preeclampsia. Women with Rhesus negative blood will also be tested for antibodies. If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced.

Daniel Tuck, from Oldbury, West Midlands, is the first person to be successfully prosecuted under a new law preventing the sale of body parts. The 26-year-old tried to sell his kidney for £24,000 on a chatroom used by kidney disease sufferers. The judge suspended his sentence for two years and ordered him to pay £250. He had faced up to three years in jail for contravening the Human Tissue Act. I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Tuck had previous convictions for theft and obtaining property by deception. Judge Challinor said: "There is much public disquiet surrounding the sale of body parts for money and there is an understandable revulsion at such practices. "A sentence incorporating an element of deterrence is required." Helena Miller, prosecuting, said Tuck admitted a charge of offering to supply human material for transplantation last month. He had posted an advert on the internet which read: "I am a healthy 25-year-old male from Birmingham in England. I am blood group O+ and am desperate for funds to rebuild my life. "I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Why risk getting a kidney from a Third World country?" He was questioned by police after meeting a reporter from the Sunday Mercury newspaper in May 2006 and agreeing a price for the kidney, she said. During the meeting Tuck confirmed he knew the sale of organs in the United Kingdom was illegal. When he was arrested in June he told police he had recently split with his girlfriend and was £25,000 in debt. "He said he wasn't thinking straight," Ms Miller said. "He said he put the advert on the site to see what would happen." Jas Mann, defending, said his client had been a broken man at the time of the offence and did not intend to go through with his proposal. He said Tuck was gambling on a regular basis and "pumped" his earnings into fruit machines. A spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority, set up under the new Act to take action against organ trafficking, said: "It is an offence to give or receive a reward for the supply or offer of human material for transplantation." A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: "Any advertisement to sell human organs is a criminal offence and, where there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest, the CPS will prosecute these cases."

Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, said charities had to be wary of pharmaceutical donations. And he urged charities to question the cost of drugs more. But patient groups said there were strict guidelines covering such donations by the drugs industry. I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug Sir Michael Rawlins, of NICE Sir Michael said: "Patient organisations need to think very carefully about why pharmaceutical companies are giving them money and they have to make sure they are not beholden to a pharmaceutical company. "I have yet ever to hear a patient organisation criticise a price of the drug. "When they do that they will come into their own." Sir Michael refused to name individual groups The subject of drug firm donations to patients groups and charities is a sensitive issue. Several groups, although not all, accept donations from drug firms. Most of those that do have codes of conduct setting out what those donations can and cannot be used for - most are restricted to funding education purposes than for campaigning. The Alzheimer's Society is involved in legal action along with Eisai and Pfizer against NICE over the decision to restrict the use of Alzheimer's treatments. The group has accepted money from both companies. But a spokeswoman pointed out that drug firm donations account for less than 1% of its income. She said the society's challenge was being done independently of the drug firms and added donations were never used to fund campaign activity. Breast Cancer Care, which pushed for NICE to approve the so-called breast cancer wonder-drug Herceptin, has received money from its maker Roche. A spokeswoman said any drug industry donations were always used for "impartial patient information". She added it was important there was a dialogue between patient groups and drug companies and she agreed cost was something that needed to be debated. "The cost of drug is clearly becoming a major factor in the potential for cancer treatment and must be addressed." And the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry denied there was anything wrong with such donations. "Patient groups and companies have a shared interest. When they work together it is in the patients' interests, usually to do with education programmes or disease awareness. "Any involvement has to be declared by the company so it is quite transparent."

Marian Howland, 52, from Epping, had not been made aware of risks linked to her operation for a prolapse in 2003. The GMC panel ruled Dr Swinhoe posed no risk to patients. In March 2003, Dr Swinhoe was working as a consultant gynaecologist at King George Hospital in Ilford and privately at Holly House Hospital in Buckhurst Hill. I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily Mrs Howland had been married for eight years when she visited Dr Swinhoe with a prolapse and discomfort during sex. She told the panel she was admitted for the prolapse to be repaired but was not informed of all the side effects or of any risks associated with the procedures. Dr Swinhoe had not taken a full medical history from Mrs Howland who had previously had a hysterectomy, her ovaries removed and become blind in one eye. In tears, Mrs Howland told the panel a few weeks after the operation it became clear she had been left unable to have sex, and had been left "shell-shocked". She added: "I have lost my best friend, my husband, my lover. "I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily." The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care. "The finding that your fitness is impaired is, in itself, a very significant mark on your record. "You have learned from this distressing experience. "This is a wholly exceptional case and in the circumstances the panel is satisfied that it is fair, proportionate and sufficient to conclude the case without taking any action in respect of your registration."

Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces." A sample of the artificial blood prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics.

Daniel Tuck, from Oldbury, West Midlands, is the first person to be successfully prosecuted under a new law preventing the sale of body parts. The 26-year-old tried to sell his kidney for £24,000 on a chatroom used by kidney disease sufferers. The judge suspended his sentence for two years and ordered him to pay £250. He had faced up to three years in jail for contravening the Human Tissue Act. I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Tuck had previous convictions for theft and obtaining property by deception. Judge Challinor said: "There is much public disquiet surrounding the sale of body parts for money and there is an understandable revulsion at such practices. "A sentence incorporating an element of deterrence is required." Helena Miller, prosecuting, said Tuck admitted a charge of offering to supply human material for transplantation last month. He had posted an advert on the internet which read: "I am a healthy 25-year-old male from Birmingham in England. I am blood group O+ and am desperate for funds to rebuild my life. "I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Why risk getting a kidney from a Third World country?" He was questioned by police after meeting a reporter from the Sunday Mercury newspaper in May 2006 and agreeing a price for the kidney, she said. During the meeting Tuck confirmed he knew the sale of organs in the United Kingdom was illegal. When he was arrested in June he told police he had recently split with his girlfriend and was £25,000 in debt. "He said he wasn't thinking straight," Ms Miller said. "He said he put the advert on the site to see what would happen." Jas Mann, defending, said his client had been a broken man at the time of the offence and did not intend to go through with his proposal. He said Tuck was gambling on a regular basis and "pumped" his earnings into fruit machines. A spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority, set up under the new Act to take action against organ trafficking, said: "It is an offence to give or receive a reward for the supply or offer of human material for transplantation." A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: "Any advertisement to sell human organs is a criminal offence and, where there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest, the CPS will prosecute these cases."

The Royal Maternity Hospital closed the unit temporarily to new admissions after the babies became seriously ill. The ward has now been chemically decontaminated. Health Minister Michael McGimpsey said eliminating infections in hospitals was a priority. Dr Stanley Craig said the babies were responding well to antibiotics. "Any infection when you're particularly compromised, as a pre-term baby is, is potentially life-threatening," he said. "These babies are responding to the antibiotics that they're on, which is good news for the babies themselves, their parents and the staff involved in their care. The hospital hopes to re-open the unit next week "Being born premature does leave you very vulnerable to infection and it can be a problem, but we're seeing encouraging signs." The babies, who picked up a multi-resistant enterobacter infection, have been isolated and are being closely monitored by specially trained nurses. The health minister said the situation was not acceptable and pointed out there had been much investment in the area of patient safety. "It is one of the issues that we look at ...and it's one of the areas I take very, very seriously," said Mr McGimpsey. "Obviously when people go to hospital they expect not to pick up infection, when they're there. There is an incidence of infections in hospitals and we look to eliminate that because whatever the incidence is, it is ... too high." Iris Robinson of the DUP said she was concerned about the impact on other hospitals. "What I am particularly concerned about is how the other hospitals across the province are going to deal with demand while the Royal's neonatal unit is out of operation," she said. "Usually the most unwell babies from all around Northern Ireland would be transferred to the specialist unit in Belfast. "Obviously this will not be the case for the immediate future, and these cases will have to be managed in their local units."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6643547.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 UK E-mail this to a friend Aspirin 'prevents bowel cancer' Aspirin could benefit high-risk groups, the study says Taking aspirin each day can prevent bowel cancer developing, a study says. Oxford University researchers said taking a dose of 300mg a day for five years offered the protection. Long-term aspirin use is generally not backed because of the risk of stomach problems, but the team said it could benefit those at high-risk of cancer. Cancer campaigners welcomed the study - published in the Lancet - which examined data from previous research covering more than 7,500 people. These findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. Each year, around 35,000 men and women in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer, and more than 16,000 die from the disease. The researchers looked at the results from two large-scale UK trials carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s covering over 7,500 people which had given some people 300, 500 or 1,200mg per day doses of aspirin or a dummy pill for five to seven years. The people in the study were then followed for up to 20 years, and deaths from bowel cancer were logged. The team say it takes at least 10 years to see an effect, because that is how long it takes for a pre-cancerous growths to develop into cancer. Other studies have examined aspirin's benefits. However, this was the first where people were allocated to take different doses of the drug, or the fake version, rather than looking back at the aspirin use of bowel cancer patients and comparing them with healthy people. High risk group 'benefit' The researchers found that taking 300mg of aspirin - the equivalent of one pill - a day for five years reduced the incidence of bowel cancer by 74% in the subsequent 10 to 15 years. An accompanying review of 30 observational studies suggested taking medium-to-high doses of aspirin for 10 years or more reduced the risk of developing the disease by 50%-70%. The protective effect of aspirin appeared to be consistent regardless of age, sex, race or country of origin. It was also seen in individuals who had a close family relative with bowel cancer, which normally raises the lifetime risk two to four times. Professor Peter Rothwell, who led the research, said: "What we are saying is that for a subgroup of people at high risk of bowel cancer, they probably aren't going to be dramatically harmed by taking aspirin. "They may have some risk of bleeding in the stomach, but they will see potentially significant benefits in the reduction of their colon cancer risk. "In that situation, I think taking aspirin daily would be worthwhile." Dr Andrew Chan, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, writing in the Lancet, said the findings were "convincing evidence" that aspirin can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer. But he added: "With the concerns about the potential risks of long-term aspirin use and the availability of alternative prevention strategies - such as screening - these findings are not sufficient to warrant a recommendation for the general population to use aspirin for cancer prevention." Rob Glynne-Jones, chief medical advisor to the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: "This is very interesting and it certainly confirms what we already know and believe about the links between aspirin, polyps and the development of bowel cancer. "However, these findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. "Aspirin at this dose over a prolonged period of time could lead to potentially serious side effects in a few people."

Professor Louis Appleby has called on NHS trusts to look at new ways of working to help people rebuild lives. He said they should look to work more closely with employment and housing agencies and cut waiting lists for talking therapies in England. Campaigners said there was a lot of work to do to ensure services were good enough for patients. In the last eight years, there has been a big push to move care out of hospitals and into the community. With units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk Marjorie Wallace, of Sane There are now more than 700 community teams, including nurses, doctors and social workers, providing a range of crisis help and early intervention. However, the Healthcare Commission last year criticised services, pointing to gaps in out-of-hours care, talking therapies and access to information. Nearly half of services were rated as fair or weak. Professor Appleby said the report was about the next phase of reform of mental health care. He told BBC News: "We've had several years of strengthening what community services do, and the report is about breaking down the barriers in the next stage of reforms. "I'm talking about barriers that get in the way of better patients' experience of care "At the moment, for example, there is a barrier between what health services traditionally do, which is clinical care, improving people's illnesses, abolishing their symptoms. "But what patients often tell us they want is help with quality of life. They want opportunities for training, for jobs, and for decent housing, and we have to take on that responsibility." His report called on the 60 mental heath trusts to consult with their local populations about what they needed. The report said mental health trusts should look at ways they could link up with agencies responsible for housing and employment. It also called for community teams to get involved in giving people more advice on how to reduce alcohol and drug use and look after their physical health. He also called for a renewed effort to reduce waiting lists for talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which sometimes has waits of over 12 months. The NHS is currently rolling out a programme of providing people with access to computerised CBT and the government has set up 10 pilots to explore ways of speeding up access to talking therapies. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said extra investment was needed. "We are all too aware that with units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk. "The government goes forward with its policy of reform and choice, but there are thousands who have no choice of where to go in crisis and little chance of rehabilitation or safe, consistent care, both in or out of hospital."

However, patients may find problems getting Avastin, as the NHS drugs watchdogs have yet to consider whether to sanction its use. The drug is designed to be used in tandem with another chemotherapy agent, paclitaxel. Avastin, which works by starving cancer cells of a blood supply, has previously been used to treat bowel cancer. All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options However, the drug was rejected for NHS use in England and Wales for that purpose last year. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) ruled that it was not cost-effective. In trials, breast cancer patients who took Avastin and paclitaxel went an average of 13 months without their cancer growing, compared with an average of 6.7 months for patients who took paclitaxel alone. Professor David Miles, a consultant medical oncologist at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre, Middlesex, said: "This provides some hope for the 13,000 patients a year that are told the devastating news they have metastatic breast cancer which cannot be cured with surgery. "It is an important step forward to have discovered another targeted treatment which can inhibit the growth of breast cancer and as a result increase significantly the time that patients' breast cancer is controlled." Dr Emma Pennery, a nurse consultant at the charity Breast Cancer Care, said women with secondary breast cancer would welcome any treatment that could potentially slow down the progression of their disease. "This announcement means that there is now another treatment option available, adding to the growing range of targeted drugs for breast cancer." Dr Pennery called on the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) and the Scottish Medicines Consortium to appraise the drug as soon as possible. Dr Sarah Rawlings, of the charity Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: "The development of targeted therapies like this is an important step forward in cancer treatment. "Avastin is an additional treatment option that will be welcomed by women with metastatic breast cancer, although it's important to remember it might not be suitable for everyone. "All breast cancer treatments will have risks and benefits so it is vital women have all the information they need to make informed decisions about their treatment options.

The Australian team has used nanotechnology to create tiny particles which specifically attack cancer cells, but leave healthy tissue unaffected. The particles - or mini-cells - are tagged with anti-cancer antibodies so they zero in on their target. The research features in the journal Cancer Cell. There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel It is hoped the technique could treat tumours in the breast, ovaries, colon and lungs. So far it has been used in mice and dogs, and the researchers plan to begin human trials shortly. Traditional chemotherapy typically involves subjecting the patient's entire body to powerful drugs, which can cause a range of severe side-effects. The mini-cells - about one-fifth the size of a normal cell - were created from bacteria cells stripped of their reproductive powers. They were then loaded with cancer drugs, and tagged with antibodies which are attracted to cancerous tumours. Once the cell reaches the cancer, the drug is released directly into the malignant growth. Researcher Jennifer MacDiarmid, from Sydney-based biotechnology company EnGeneIC, said: "There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel." In tests, the technique reduced tumours in animals without side effects - and by using only a very small amount of drug. Dr MacDiarmid said the treatment could potentially be used on any solid tumours. She said the technique potentially paved the way for customised drug cocktails for individual patients. Professor Quentin Pankhurst, of the London Centre for Nanotechnology, said: "The concept of targeted drug delivery is something which has been around for a while and there are many different avenues that have been tested. "This one looks like an interesting and promising one. "I particularly like the fact that these mini-cells, as they call them, seem to be swallowed up by the cancer cells and taken inside the cancer cells, because that is inherently a very powerful way to actually deliver the drug - actually into the cell."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/hi/english/static/in_depth/health/2000/heart_disease/default.stm	BBC News | Health | Heart Disease The UK has one of the highest rates of death from heart disease in the world - one British adult dies from the disease every three minutes - and stroke is the country's third biggest killer, claiming 70,000 lives each year. Heart attacks occur when blood flow is blocked, often by a blood clot, while strokes are caused either by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain. A range of other conditions, including heart failure, when blood is not pumped properly around the body, and congenital heart defects can also cause long term problems, and even death, for sufferers. - The blood returns from the lungs to the upper left chamber of the heart where it is again briefly stored until the atrium fills, before flowing on to the left ventricle. - Impure or blue blood returning from the atrium enters the heart here, where it is held until the atrium - or chamber - fills up. - This is the most powerful chamber of the heart. It pumps the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta, or main artery. - This powerful pump propels blood into the pulmonary artery, the tube which carries blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide in the blood is removed and oxygen added.

In the UK pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last period so for as much as three weeks of this first month she might not be actually pregnant. When fertilisation does occur the tiny mass of cells called a blastocyst at this stage embeds itself in the lining of the womb which is already thickening to support it. The mass of cells is developing fast and becomes an embryo. For many women the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Shopbought tests are considered largely reliable so the mother-to-be does not have to have her pregnancy confirmed by her GP. If a first test is negative a second one a few days later may prove positive as hormone levels in the urine rise. The embryo officially becomes a foetus. It is about the size of a baked bean and its spine and nervous system begin to form. The foetus already has its own blood system and may be a different blood group from its mother. Blood vessels are forming in what will become the umbilical cord and tiny buds which will become limbs appear. The baby&acute;s heart is beginning to develop. Morning sickness and other side effects of early pregnancy may take hold. Around this time many women find they experience the side-effects of early pregnancy including needing to urinate more often nausea and vomiting and feeling a bit weepy and irritable. All medication including supplements need to be carefully checked as the foetus is undergoing vital development in the first 12 weeks. If the woman has not told her GP or community midwife she is pregnant yet now is a good time to do so. It is quite common to have a first scan at this stage if the woman has had a previous miscarriage or bleeding. An early scan is often done through the vagina and is used to check the pregnancy is not ectopic. It should show up the baby&acute;s heartbeat. The nervous system is also developing rapidly especially the brain. The head gets bigger and eyes form under the skin of the face. The foetus' limbs are growing and look more like arms and legs. All internal organs are developing and becoming more complex. The foetus is about 5cm long with its head tucked onto its chest. It has most its major organs and eyes and ears are developing. A scan at 10-13 weeks is recommended to pin down the date of the pregnancy. The umbilical cord is fully formed providing nourishment and removing waste products. The foetus looks fully human now. By this week the threat of miscarriage is much reduced. Many women announce their pregnancy to friends and colleagues. The foetus is growing in length much more quickly by now it is about eight cm long and weighs about 60 grams. The placenta is now wellformed though it's not yet doing its full job it takes over fully in week 14. The mother is likely to have her first scan this week. The womans uterus is becoming larger and is starting to rise out of the pelvis. The foetus can move its head quite easily. Third of the way through. The average pregnancy lasts 266 days or 280 days from the first day of last period. Screening for Downs syndrome is offered about now. A simple blood test is carried out first then further tests may be offered. On the basis of the blood test results the woman may opt for a Chorionic Villus sample or an amniocentesis which would diagnose or other chromosomal abnormalities. However these diagnostic tests have a small risk of subsequent miscarriage. An alternative to blood tests is a nuchal translucency scan a new scan offered by some larger hospitals. But again an amniocentisis would be required for firm diagnosis. The foetus now has toe and finger nails eyebrows and eyelashes. It is also covered with downy hair. The hair that will cover the baby until the last week or so of pregnancy - called lanugo - starts to form. This hair is very fine more like down and it probably serves as some form of insulation and protection for the skin. The foetus can hear noises from the outside world. By this stage the mother is visibly pregnant and the uterus is rising. By this stage the foetus is moving around a lot - probably enough to be felt. The foetus is now about 15-20cm long and weighs about 300g. Milk teeth have formed in the gums. Half way through pregnancy now. Almost all mothers are offered a routine scan. The foetus develops a waxy coating called vernix. The scan can show the foetus in fine detail and often reveal if the baby is a boy or a girl. However not all hospitals offer to tell parents the sex of the child - and not all parents want to know. The mother may feel short of breath as her uterus pushes against her diaphragm leaving less space for the lungs. The mother may be offered another ultrasound scan around this time. The scan can check the baby&acute;s spine internal organs and growth are normal. Senses develop: taste buds have started to form on the tongue and the foetus starts to feel touch. The skeleton continues to develop and bones that form the skull begin to harden - but not fully. Antenatal checkup and scan to check the baby&acute;s position. A baby born this early does sometimes survive. A baby born at 24 weeks may possibly survive but it would have severe breathing difficulties as its lungs would not be strong enough to cope. It would also be very thin lightweight and susceptible to infections. All organs are now in place and the rest of the pregnancy is for growth. Preeclampsia is a risk from here onwards. This potentially fatal condition causes high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling caused by fluid retention. The causes are unclear but research suggests it may be linked to an immune reaction to the foetus or the placenta. If the condition is serious women may be advised to take drugs to lower their blood pressure and in some cases an early caesarean or induction may be performed. Serious complications of pregnancy The foetus skin is gradually becoming more opaque than transparent. The foetus measures about 34cm and weighs about 800g. Routine checkup to test for preeclampsia. Women with Rhesus negative blood will also be tested for antibodies. If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced.

The Royal Maternity Hospital closed the unit temporarily to new admissions after the babies became seriously ill. The ward has now been chemically decontaminated. Health Minister Michael McGimpsey said eliminating infections in hospitals was a priority. Dr Stanley Craig said the babies were responding well to antibiotics. "Any infection when you're particularly compromised, as a pre-term baby is, is potentially life-threatening," he said. "These babies are responding to the antibiotics that they're on, which is good news for the babies themselves, their parents and the staff involved in their care. The hospital hopes to re-open the unit next week "Being born premature does leave you very vulnerable to infection and it can be a problem, but we're seeing encouraging signs." The babies, who picked up a multi-resistant enterobacter infection, have been isolated and are being closely monitored by specially trained nurses. The health minister said the situation was not acceptable and pointed out there had been much investment in the area of patient safety. "It is one of the issues that we look at ...and it's one of the areas I take very, very seriously," said Mr McGimpsey. "Obviously when people go to hospital they expect not to pick up infection, when they're there. There is an incidence of infections in hospitals and we look to eliminate that because whatever the incidence is, it is ... too high." Iris Robinson of the DUP said she was concerned about the impact on other hospitals. "What I am particularly concerned about is how the other hospitals across the province are going to deal with demand while the Royal's neonatal unit is out of operation," she said. "Usually the most unwell babies from all around Northern Ireland would be transferred to the specialist unit in Belfast. "Obviously this will not be the case for the immediate future, and these cases will have to be managed in their local units."

Professor Louis Appleby has called on NHS trusts to look at new ways of working to help people rebuild lives. He said they should look to work more closely with employment and housing agencies and cut waiting lists for talking therapies in England. Campaigners said there was a lot of work to do to ensure services were good enough for patients. In the last eight years, there has been a big push to move care out of hospitals and into the community. With units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk Marjorie Wallace, of Sane There are now more than 700 community teams, including nurses, doctors and social workers, providing a range of crisis help and early intervention. However, the Healthcare Commission last year criticised services, pointing to gaps in out-of-hours care, talking therapies and access to information. Nearly half of services were rated as fair or weak. Professor Appleby said the report was about the next phase of reform of mental health care. He told BBC News: "We've had several years of strengthening what community services do, and the report is about breaking down the barriers in the next stage of reforms. "I'm talking about barriers that get in the way of better patients' experience of care "At the moment, for example, there is a barrier between what health services traditionally do, which is clinical care, improving people's illnesses, abolishing their symptoms. "But what patients often tell us they want is help with quality of life. They want opportunities for training, for jobs, and for decent housing, and we have to take on that responsibility." His report called on the 60 mental heath trusts to consult with their local populations about what they needed. The report said mental health trusts should look at ways they could link up with agencies responsible for housing and employment. It also called for community teams to get involved in giving people more advice on how to reduce alcohol and drug use and look after their physical health. He also called for a renewed effort to reduce waiting lists for talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which sometimes has waits of over 12 months. The NHS is currently rolling out a programme of providing people with access to computerised CBT and the government has set up 10 pilots to explore ways of speeding up access to talking therapies. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said extra investment was needed. "We are all too aware that with units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk. "The government goes forward with its policy of reform and choice, but there are thousands who have no choice of where to go in crisis and little chance of rehabilitation or safe, consistent care, both in or out of hospital."

The disease tends to affect older people - but can strike at any time. Excluding certain skin cancers, there were more than 270,000 new cases of the disease in 2001 - and the rate is increasing by about 1% a year. Some cancer, such as breast, are becoming more common, while new cases of lung cancer fall away due to the drop in the number of smokers. However, while the overall number of new cancers is not falling, the good news is that successful treatment rates for many of the most common types are improving rapidly.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6648059.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Experts back folic acid in flour Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 17:03 GMT 18:03 UK E-mail this to a friend Experts back folic acid in flour Under the plan, all bread would be made with folic acid-fortified flour The UK's official food watchdog is backing the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid to reduce birth defects such as spina bifida. The proposal will go before the board of the Food Standards Agency next week for ratification. If passed, ministers will then decide whether to press ahead. Scientific research shows that folic acid significantly cuts the risk of neural tube defects, which affect up to 900 pregnancies a year in the UK. However, there is concern that adding the vitamin to flour could harm some elderly patients, as it could mask a deficiency in the B12 vitamin. Up to 10% of those aged 65 and older have borderline B12 levels and could tip into deficiency. In extreme cases, this can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system. The recommendation to the FSA board suggests that products containing folic acid at nutritionally significant levels should be clearly labelled. It also argues that mandatory fortification should be accompanied by new controls on the voluntary addition of folic acid to other products, such as breakfast cereals and low-fat spreads, and on the use of folic acid supplements. A system for monitoring the health impact of fortification would also be needed. Wholemeal flour would be exempt from fortification in order to give consumers more choice. The FSA already advises women to eat extra folic acid when trying to get pregnant. However, research suggests that only half of such women adhere to this advice. Also, up to half of pregnancies are unplanned, meaning women may miss the opportunity. Each year between 500 and 600 babies in the UK are reported to have neural tube defects. It is thought many of the other affected pregnancies are terminated. Mandatory fortification has already been introduced in the USA, Canada and Chile, where it cut NTD rates by between 27% and 50%. A panel of UK experts, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), last year backed mandatory fortification of flour. SACN found no evidence that vitamin B12 deficiency was masked in older people, provided folic acid doses were 1mg a day or less. An FSA consultation on the issue drew 202 responses from industry, consumer groups and individuals. The baking industry raised "practical concerns" about the fortification of bread. It said bread-making flour couldn't easily be separated from other flours in mills.

Half of children enter primary school unable to speak as well as they are expected to, research suggests. The Early Talk programme which uses gestures, symbols and signing to expand vocabulary, is being piloted in 200 government-backed children's centres. It will also be used to target youngsters with potential difficulties. Television doesn't respond well to children. ICAN head of Early Years Clare Geldard, head of Early Years for the charity behind the programme, I CAN, said there were concerns that the number of pre-school children with speech and language difficulties was on the rise. "We don't know why this is the case and I am sure there are a myriad of reasons. "We know that television can be used in a really productive way in terms of watching a piece of television and then having a conversation about it afterwards, but we also know that television doesn't respond well to children. "It does not give them the interactivity that children and adults instinctively seek from adults." She said the Early Talk programme was about ensuring that nursery staff, childminders and parents had the basic skills they needed to enhance children's speech, language and communication. "Everybody needs to have a basic knowledge about what we can do to enhance children's speech and language development," she said. But it was also about ensuring that those children who had the potential to go on to develop speech and language difficulties were picked up early and given the help they need. I CAN's chief executive Virginia Beardshaw said one in 10 children across the UK were thought to have a communication disability. She added that the Early Talk programme, which will ultimately be rolled out to 3,000 Sure Start children's centres, would foster environments "where communication is embedded". This would range from using pictures, symbols and gestures to teach vocabulary to using group work and specialist help from speech and language therapists, she said. Children's minister Beverley Hughes said: "Communication is a vital skill in life and we want to help all children communicate better and reap the rewards of that later in life. "This is especially important for children who have trouble communicating - particularly those with a communication disability - who are much more likely to develop behavioural and learning problems." She said she hoped the partnership being announced would play a vital role in identifying children's difficulties at an early stage. Nursery and children's centre staff will be given training and packages of support to help ensure children's language skills are polished and it is hoped this will be passed on to parents and children's carers.

The Australian team has used nanotechnology to create tiny particles which specifically attack cancer cells, but leave healthy tissue unaffected. The particles - or mini-cells - are tagged with anti-cancer antibodies so they zero in on their target. The research features in the journal Cancer Cell. There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel It is hoped the technique could treat tumours in the breast, ovaries, colon and lungs. So far it has been used in mice and dogs, and the researchers plan to begin human trials shortly. Traditional chemotherapy typically involves subjecting the patient's entire body to powerful drugs, which can cause a range of severe side-effects. The mini-cells - about one-fifth the size of a normal cell - were created from bacteria cells stripped of their reproductive powers. They were then loaded with cancer drugs, and tagged with antibodies which are attracted to cancerous tumours. Once the cell reaches the cancer, the drug is released directly into the malignant growth. Researcher Jennifer MacDiarmid, from Sydney-based biotechnology company EnGeneIC, said: "There is no other system where you can get so much drug concentrated into a little parcel." In tests, the technique reduced tumours in animals without side effects - and by using only a very small amount of drug. Dr MacDiarmid said the treatment could potentially be used on any solid tumours. She said the technique potentially paved the way for customised drug cocktails for individual patients. Professor Quentin Pankhurst, of the London Centre for Nanotechnology, said: "The concept of targeted drug delivery is something which has been around for a while and there are many different avenues that have been tested. "This one looks like an interesting and promising one.

Marian Howland, 52, from Epping, had not been made aware of risks linked to her operation for a prolapse in 2003. The GMC panel ruled Dr Swinhoe posed no risk to patients. In March 2003, Dr Swinhoe was working as a consultant gynaecologist at King George Hospital in Ilford and privately at Holly House Hospital in Buckhurst Hill. I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily Mrs Howland had been married for eight years when she visited Dr Swinhoe with a prolapse and discomfort during sex. She told the panel she was admitted for the prolapse to be repaired but was not informed of all the side effects or of any risks associated with the procedures. Dr Swinhoe had not taken a full medical history from Mrs Howland who had previously had a hysterectomy, her ovaries removed and become blind in one eye. In tears, Mrs Howland told the panel a few weeks after the operation it became clear she had been left unable to have sex, and had been left "shell-shocked". She added: "I have lost my best friend, my husband, my lover. "I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily." The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care. "The finding that your fitness is impaired is, in itself, a very significant mark on your record. "You have learned from this distressing experience.

The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care. "The finding that your fitness is impaired is, in itself, a very significant mark on your record. "You have learned from this distressing experience. "This is a wholly exceptional case and in the circumstances the panel is satisfied that it is fair, proportionate and sufficient to conclude the case without taking any action in respect of your registration."

HPV infection was found to be a much stronger risk factor than tobacco or alcohol use, the Johns Hopkins University study of 300 people found. The New England Journal of Medicine study said the risk was almost nine times higher for people who reported oral sex with more than six partners. But experts said a larger study was needed to confirm the findings. HPV infection is the cause of the majority of cervical cancers, and 80% of sexually active women can expect to have an HPV infection at some point in their lives. It is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza, study author The Johns Hopkins study took blood and saliva from 100 men and women newly diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer which affects the throat, tonsils and back of the tongue. They also asked questions about sex practices and other risk factors for the disease, such as family history. Those who had evidence of prior oral HPV infection had a 32-fold increased risk of throat cancer. HPV16 - one of the most common cancer-causing strains of the virus - was present in the tumours of 72% of cancer patients in the study. There was no added risk for people infected with HPV who also smoked and drank alcohol, suggesting the virus itself is driving the risk of the cancer. Oral sex was said to be the main mode of transmission of HPV but the researchers said mouth-to-mouth transmission, for example through kissing, could not be ruled out. Most HPV infections clear with little or no symptoms but a small percentage of people who acquired high-risk strains may develop a cancer, the researchers added. Study author Dr Gypsyamber D'Souza said: "It is important for health care providers to know that people without the traditional risk factors of tobacco and alcohol use can nevertheless be at risk of oropharyngeal cancer." Co-researcher Dr Maura Gillison said previous research by the team had suggested there was a strong link. But she added: "People should be reassured that oropharyngeal cancer is relatively uncommon and the overwhelming majority of people with an oral HPV infection probably will not get throat cancer." A vaccine which protects against cervical cancer caused by HPV strains 6, 11, 16 and 18, and also against genital warts is available and the researchers said the study provided a rationale for vaccinating both girls and boys. But whether the vaccine would protect against oral HPV infection is not yet known. Dr Julie Sharp, science information officer at Cancer Research UK, said: "There is conflicting evidence about the role of HPV, and this rare type of mouth cancer. "As this was a small study, further research is needed to confirm these observations." "We know that after age, the main causes of mouth cancer are smoking or chewing tobacco or betel nut, and drinking too much alcohol."

The study also said that parents who do not want their children to drink behind their backs should limit their pocket money to less than £10 a week. The study, led by Liverpool John Moores University, was based on responses from more than 10,000 15 and 16-year-olds. Almost 90% admitted to drinking alcohol, of which 38% binged, 24% drank frequently and 50% drank in public. Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol Liverpool John Moores University The study also found a third of respondents bought their own alcohol, and those that did were six times more likely to drink in public, and twice as likely to binge than those who had alcohol bought for them. Last month the charity Alcohol Concern called for parents who give alcohol to children aged under 15 to be prosecuted following figures suggesting a large increase in alcohol consumption by 11 to 13-year-olds. But the latest study, published in the journal Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy, questions this approach. Lead researcher Dr Mark Bellis said figures suggested that 75% of 14-year-olds had tried alcohol. "The question is: are they learning to drink from their parents in a socially responsible environment, or are they learning behind some bushes in the park, or in a bar where they should not be in the first place? "The chances are if they are in the latter position they are learning to binge drink, they are hiding their drinking, they can't talk to their parents about it. "Drinking in the home environment, if it is done properly, can teach young people respect for alcohol, and how to consume in moderation." Dr Bellis said criminalising a parent for allowing a child to drink was probably not going to help any family. Frank Soodeen, campaigns officer for Alcohol Concern, said the charity had taken its lead from the law, which prohibits under-15s from being served alcohol in public places. He agreed that it was appropriate for parents to allow drinking in the home for older teenagers - but reiterated the charity's view that younger teenagers should not be encouraged to drink. He said: "We agree that parents have a real role to play in raising socially responsible drinkers." The researchers say that increasing the cost of alcohol, and closing down retailers who sell to underage drinkers could help tackle the problem.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/6645923.stm	BBC NEWS | England | North Yorkshire | Scientists create 'plastic' blood Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 09:08 GMT 10:08 UK E-mail this to a friend Scientists create 'plastic' blood The researchers said the artificial blood was easier to store Scientists have developed an artificial plastic blood which could act as a substitute in emergencies. Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital.

Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces."

Oxford University researchers said taking a dose of 300mg a day for five years offered the protection. Long-term aspirin use is generally not backed because of the risk of stomach problems, but the team said it could benefit those at high-risk of cancer. Cancer campaigners welcomed the study - published in the Lancet - which examined data from previous research covering more than 7,500 people. These findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. Each year, around 35,000 men and women in the UK are diagnosed with bowel cancer, and more than 16,000 die from the disease. The researchers looked at the results from two large-scale UK trials carried out in the late 1970s and early 1980s covering over 7,500 people which had given some people 300, 500 or 1,200mg per day doses of aspirin or a dummy pill for five to seven years. The people in the study were then followed for up to 20 years, and deaths from bowel cancer were logged. The team say it takes at least 10 years to see an effect, because that is how long it takes for a pre-cancerous growths to develop into cancer. Other studies have examined aspirin's benefits. However, this was the first where people were allocated to take different doses of the drug, or the fake version, rather than looking back at the aspirin use of bowel cancer patients and comparing them with healthy people. High risk group 'benefit' The researchers found that taking 300mg of aspirin - the equivalent of one pill - a day for five years reduced the incidence of bowel cancer by 74% in the subsequent 10 to 15 years. An accompanying review of 30 observational studies suggested taking medium-to-high doses of aspirin for 10 years or more reduced the risk of developing the disease by 50%-70%. The protective effect of aspirin appeared to be consistent regardless of age, sex, race or country of origin. It was also seen in individuals who had a close family relative with bowel cancer, which normally raises the lifetime risk two to four times. Professor Peter Rothwell, who led the research, said: "What we are saying is that for a subgroup of people at high risk of bowel cancer, they probably aren't going to be dramatically harmed by taking aspirin. "They may have some risk of bleeding in the stomach, but they will see potentially significant benefits in the reduction of their colon cancer risk. "In that situation, I think taking aspirin daily would be worthwhile." Dr Andrew Chan, from Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, writing in the Lancet, said the findings were "convincing evidence" that aspirin can reduce the incidence of bowel cancer. But he added: "With the concerns about the potential risks of long-term aspirin use and the availability of alternative prevention strategies - such as screening - these findings are not sufficient to warrant a recommendation for the general population to use aspirin for cancer prevention." Rob Glynne-Jones, chief medical advisor to the charity Bowel Cancer UK, said: "This is very interesting and it certainly confirms what we already know and believe about the links between aspirin, polyps and the development of bowel cancer. "However, these findings are not an indication that the general population should rush out and take what is a high dosage of aspirin on a daily basis. "Aspirin at this dose over a prolonged period of time could lead to potentially serious side effects in a few people."

University officials are considering whether they should ban physiotherapy lecturers from using large exercise balls as chairs. Physiotherapists at the University of Bath say sitting on the balls while working at a desk encourages good posture and tones core muscles. Their professional body agrees that they are beneficial and carry no risk. But health and safety officials are concerned that the giant inflatables may be dangerous. A spokesman for the university said: "The university's health and safety team are looking into whether the balls meet the university's guidelines on conventional chairs to see if the trial can be allowed to become a permanent situation. We expect the result of this shortly." The balls are often used in gyms and are also known as Swiss balls because they were first used in Switzerland in the 1960s by therapists working with children with cerebral palsy. Physiotherapist Sonya Crowe from the university's Department for Health started a trend when she began using an exercise ball instead of a chair. Ms Crowe, who is the sports physiotherapist for the British beach volleyball team, said: "The balls are firm with a bit of give, so it is not difficult to balance on top of them, but the constant small movements you make whilst sitting at a desk are perfect for strengthening your core muscles. "You also have to sit upright, so they are perfect for improving posture. "In particular, people who suffer from back ache and shoulder pain can really benefit from sitting on an exercise ball instead of a regular office chair." She added: "I have never heard of anyone falling off one of the balls - and the health and safety benefits far outweigh any risks there may be." Ms Crowe's colleague Emily Richards said: "You couldn't miss the fact that Sonya was sat on a big squashy ball instead of an office chair. "A few of us tried it out and could see the benefit immediately. We put in a bulk order and now at least a dozen people around the university have got them." She added: "It seems to have started a real craze, and my husband has now got one at his work to help his bad back." The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy said there was no risk if the balls were used properly. One sports website warns that jewellery and belt buckles could burst the ball but says that most are made to deflate slowly rather than explode. The Health and Safety Executive said it was up to individual employers to decide how to meet their legal obligation to protect their staff.

In the UK pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last period so for as much as three weeks of this first month she might not be actually pregnant. When fertilisation does occur the tiny mass of cells called a blastocyst at this stage embeds itself in the lining of the womb which is already thickening to support it. The mass of cells is developing fast and becomes an embryo. For many women the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Shopbought tests are considered largely reliable so the mother-to-be does not have to have her pregnancy confirmed by her GP. If a first test is negative a second one a few days later may prove positive as hormone levels in the urine rise. The embryo officially becomes a foetus. It is about the size of a baked bean and its spine and nervous system begin to form. The foetus already has its own blood system and may be a different blood group from its mother. Blood vessels are forming in what will become the umbilical cord and tiny buds which will become limbs appear. The baby&acute;s heart is beginning to develop. Morning sickness and other side effects of early pregnancy may take hold. Around this time many women find they experience the side-effects of early pregnancy including needing to urinate more often nausea and vomiting and feeling a bit weepy and irritable. All medication including supplements need to be carefully checked as the foetus is undergoing vital development in the first 12 weeks. If the woman has not told her GP or community midwife she is pregnant yet now is a good time to do so. It is quite common to have a first scan at this stage if the woman has had a previous miscarriage or bleeding. An early scan is often done through the vagina and is used to check the pregnancy is not ectopic. It should show up the baby&acute;s heartbeat. The nervous system is also developing rapidly especially the brain. The head gets bigger and eyes form under the skin of the face. The foetus' limbs are growing and look more like arms and legs. All internal organs are developing and becoming more complex. The foetus is about 5cm long with its head tucked onto its chest. It has most its major organs and eyes and ears are developing. A scan at 10-13 weeks is recommended to pin down the date of the pregnancy. The umbilical cord is fully formed providing nourishment and removing waste products. The foetus looks fully human now. By this week the threat of miscarriage is much reduced. Many women announce their pregnancy to friends and colleagues. The foetus is growing in length much more quickly by now it is about eight cm long and weighs about 60 grams. The placenta is now wellformed though it's not yet doing its full job it takes over fully in week 14. The mother is likely to have her first scan this week. The womans uterus is becoming larger and is starting to rise out of the pelvis. The foetus can move its head quite easily. Third of the way through. The average pregnancy lasts 266 days or 280 days from the first day of last period. Screening for Downs syndrome is offered about now. A simple blood test is carried out first then further tests may be offered. On the basis of the blood test results the woman may opt for a Chorionic Villus sample or an amniocentesis which would diagnose or other chromosomal abnormalities. However these diagnostic tests have a small risk of subsequent miscarriage. An alternative to blood tests is a nuchal translucency scan a new scan offered by some larger hospitals. But again an amniocentisis would be required for firm diagnosis. The foetus now has toe and finger nails eyebrows and eyelashes. It is also covered with downy hair. The hair that will cover the baby until the last week or so of pregnancy - called lanugo - starts to form. This hair is very fine more like down and it probably serves as some form of insulation and protection for the skin. The foetus can hear noises from the outside world. By this stage the mother is visibly pregnant and the uterus is rising. By this stage the foetus is moving around a lot - probably enough to be felt. The foetus is now about 15-20cm long and weighs about 300g. Milk teeth have formed in the gums. Half way through pregnancy now. Almost all mothers are offered a routine scan. The foetus develops a waxy coating called vernix. The scan can show the foetus in fine detail and often reveal if the baby is a boy or a girl. However not all hospitals offer to tell parents the sex of the child - and not all parents want to know. The mother may feel short of breath as her uterus pushes against her diaphragm leaving less space for the lungs. The mother may be offered another ultrasound scan around this time. The scan can check the baby&acute;s spine internal organs and growth are normal. Senses develop: taste buds have started to form on the tongue and the foetus starts to feel touch. The skeleton continues to develop and bones that form the skull begin to harden - but not fully. Antenatal checkup and scan to check the baby&acute;s position. A baby born this early does sometimes survive. A baby born at 24 weeks may possibly survive but it would have severe breathing difficulties as its lungs would not be strong enough to cope. It would also be very thin lightweight and susceptible to infections. All organs are now in place and the rest of the pregnancy is for growth. Preeclampsia is a risk from here onwards. This potentially fatal condition causes high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling caused by fluid retention. The causes are unclear but research suggests it may be linked to an immune reaction to the foetus or the placenta. If the condition is serious women may be advised to take drugs to lower their blood pressure and in some cases an early caesarean or induction may be performed. Serious complications of pregnancy The foetus skin is gradually becoming more opaque than transparent. The foetus measures about 34cm and weighs about 800g. Routine checkup to test for preeclampsia. Women with Rhesus negative blood will also be tested for antibodies. If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced.

If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced.

University officials are considering whether they should ban physiotherapy lecturers from using large exercise balls as chairs. Physiotherapists at the University of Bath say sitting on the balls while working at a desk encourages good posture and tones core muscles. Their professional body agrees that they are beneficial and carry no risk. But health and safety officials are concerned that the giant inflatables may be dangerous. A spokesman for the university said: "The university's health and safety team are looking into whether the balls meet the university's guidelines on conventional chairs to see if the trial can be allowed to become a permanent situation. We expect the result of this shortly." The balls are often used in gyms and are also known as Swiss balls because they were first used in Switzerland in the 1960s by therapists working with children with cerebral palsy. Physiotherapist Sonya Crowe from the university's Department for Health started a trend when she began using an exercise ball instead of a chair. Ms Crowe, who is the sports physiotherapist for the British beach volleyball team, said: "The balls are firm with a bit of give, so it is not difficult to balance on top of them, but the constant small movements you make whilst sitting at a desk are perfect for strengthening your core muscles. "You also have to sit upright, so they are perfect for improving posture. "In particular, people who suffer from back ache and shoulder pain can really benefit from sitting on an exercise ball instead of a regular office chair." She added: "I have never heard of anyone falling off one of the balls - and the health and safety benefits far outweigh any risks there may be." Ms Crowe's colleague Emily Richards said: "You couldn't miss the fact that Sonya was sat on a big squashy ball instead of an office chair. "A few of us tried it out and could see the benefit immediately. We put in a bulk order and now at least a dozen people around the university have got them." She added: "It seems to have started a real craze, and my husband has now got one at his work to help his bad back." The Chartered Society of Physiotherapy said there was no risk if the balls were used properly. One sports website warns that jewellery and belt buckles could burst the ball but says that most are made to deflate slowly rather than explode. The Health and Safety Executive said it was up to individual employers to decide how to meet their legal obligation to protect their staff.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6648059.stm	BBC NEWS | Health | Experts back folic acid in flour Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 17:03 GMT 18:03 UK E-mail this to a friend Experts back folic acid in flour Under the plan, all bread would be made with folic acid-fortified flour The UK's official food watchdog is backing the mandatory fortification of flour with folic acid to reduce birth defects such as spina bifida. The proposal will go before the board of the Food Standards Agency next week for ratification. If passed, ministers will then decide whether to press ahead. Scientific research shows that folic acid significantly cuts the risk of neural tube defects, which affect up to 900 pregnancies a year in the UK. However, there is concern that adding the vitamin to flour could harm some elderly patients, as it could mask a deficiency in the B12 vitamin. Up to 10% of those aged 65 and older have borderline B12 levels and could tip into deficiency. In extreme cases, this can cause irreversible damage to the nervous system. The recommendation to the FSA board suggests that products containing folic acid at nutritionally significant levels should be clearly labelled. It also argues that mandatory fortification should be accompanied by new controls on the voluntary addition of folic acid to other products, such as breakfast cereals and low-fat spreads, and on the use of folic acid supplements. A system for monitoring the health impact of fortification would also be needed. Wholemeal flour would be exempt from fortification in order to give consumers more choice. The FSA already advises women to eat extra folic acid when trying to get pregnant. However, research suggests that only half of such women adhere to this advice. Also, up to half of pregnancies are unplanned, meaning women may miss the opportunity. Each year between 500 and 600 babies in the UK are reported to have neural tube defects. It is thought many of the other affected pregnancies are terminated. Mandatory fortification has already been introduced in the USA, Canada and Chile, where it cut NTD rates by between 27% and 50%. A panel of UK experts, the Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN), last year backed mandatory fortification of flour. SACN found no evidence that vitamin B12 deficiency was masked in older people, provided folic acid doses were 1mg a day or less. An FSA consultation on the issue drew 202 responses from industry, consumer groups and individuals. The baking industry raised "practical concerns" about the fortification of bread. It said bread-making flour couldn't easily be separated from other flours in mills.

Daniel Tuck, from Oldbury, West Midlands, is the first person to be successfully prosecuted under a new law preventing the sale of body parts. The 26-year-old tried to sell his kidney for £24,000 on a chatroom used by kidney disease sufferers. The judge suspended his sentence for two years and ordered him to pay £250. He had faced up to three years in jail for contravening the Human Tissue Act. I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Tuck had previous convictions for theft and obtaining property by deception. Judge Challinor said: "There is much public disquiet surrounding the sale of body parts for money and there is an understandable revulsion at such practices. "A sentence incorporating an element of deterrence is required." Helena Miller, prosecuting, said Tuck admitted a charge of offering to supply human material for transplantation last month. He had posted an advert on the internet which read: "I am a healthy 25-year-old male from Birmingham in England. I am blood group O+ and am desperate for funds to rebuild my life. "I want to sell my kidney - this is 100% genuine. I am a white male of completely perfect health. Why risk getting a kidney from a Third World country?" He was questioned by police after meeting a reporter from the Sunday Mercury newspaper in May 2006 and agreeing a price for the kidney, she said. During the meeting Tuck confirmed he knew the sale of organs in the United Kingdom was illegal. When he was arrested in June he told police he had recently split with his girlfriend and was £25,000 in debt. "He said he wasn't thinking straight," Ms Miller said. "He said he put the advert on the site to see what would happen." Jas Mann, defending, said his client had been a broken man at the time of the offence and did not intend to go through with his proposal. He said Tuck was gambling on a regular basis and "pumped" his earnings into fruit machines. A spokesman for the Human Tissue Authority, set up under the new Act to take action against organ trafficking, said: "It is an offence to give or receive a reward for the supply or offer of human material for transplantation." A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: "Any advertisement to sell human organs is a criminal offence and, where there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public interest, the CPS will prosecute these cases."

Sir Michael Rawlins, chairman of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, said charities had to be wary of pharmaceutical donations.

Sir Michael refused to name individual groups The subject of drug firm donations to patients groups and charities is a sensitive issue. Several groups, although not all, accept donations from drug firms. Most of those that do have codes of conduct setting out what those donations can and cannot be used for - most are restricted to funding education purposes than for campaigning. The Alzheimer's Society is involved in legal action along with Eisai and Pfizer against NICE over the decision to restrict the use of Alzheimer's treatments. The group has accepted money from both companies. But a spokeswoman pointed out that drug firm donations account for less than 1% of its income. She said the society's challenge was being done independently of the drug firms and added donations were never used to fund campaign activity. Breast Cancer Care, which pushed for NICE to approve the so-called breast cancer wonder-drug Herceptin, has received money from its maker Roche. A spokeswoman said any drug industry donations were always used for "impartial patient information". She added it was important there was a dialogue between patient groups and drug companies and she agreed cost was something that needed to be debated. "The cost of drug is clearly becoming a major factor in the potential for cancer treatment and must be addressed." And the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry denied there was anything wrong with such donations. "Patient groups and companies have a shared interest.

The General Medical Council (GMC) ruled it had been an "exceptional" case that saw Essex-based Dr June Swinhoe fail in her practise. Marian Howland, 52, from Epping, had not been made aware of risks linked to her operation for a prolapse in 2003. The GMC panel ruled Dr Swinhoe posed no risk to patients. In March 2003, Dr Swinhoe was working as a consultant gynaecologist at King George Hospital in Ilford and privately at Holly House Hospital in Buckhurst Hill. I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily Mrs Howland had been married for eight years when she visited Dr Swinhoe with a prolapse and discomfort during sex. She told the panel she was admitted for the prolapse to be repaired but was not informed of all the side effects or of any risks associated with the procedures. Dr Swinhoe had not taken a full medical history from Mrs Howland who had previously had a hysterectomy, her ovaries removed and become blind in one eye. In tears, Mrs Howland told the panel a few weeks after the operation it became clear she had been left unable to have sex, and had been left "shell-shocked". She added: "I have lost my best friend, my husband, my lover. "I have lost a lot of my life and all unnecessarily." The panel told Dr Swinhoe: "The deficiencies in your communication with Mrs Howland and your failure to obtain consent from her were an aberration and amount to an isolated departure from your usual high standards of professional competence and care. "The finding that your fitness is impaired is, in itself, a very significant mark on your record. "You have learned from this distressing experience.

Jack Beaumont, from Sutton-in-Ashfield, is believed to be one of just 300 people in the world who have been diagnosed with melorheostosis. The disease, which causes excess bone growth, has left Jack with half the normal movement in his right arm. He was meeting experts at a national conference on melorheostosis in Oxford on Friday. Jack and fellow sufferers shared their stories at the UK Melorheostosis Conference. "I'm hoping for some answers and I'm looking forward to meeting some other people who've got the same disease as me," he said. His mother, Nicola Beaumont, added: "He just shrugs it off because he's so laid back, nothing affects him in that respect but I think as he gets older, he's going to find more restrictions."

The Royal Maternity Hospital closed the unit temporarily to new admissions after the babies became seriously ill. The ward has now been chemically decontaminated. Health Minister Michael McGimpsey said eliminating infections in hospitals was a priority. Dr Stanley Craig said the babies were responding well to antibiotics. "Any infection when you're particularly compromised, as a pre-term baby is, is potentially life-threatening," he said. "These babies are responding to the antibiotics that they're on, which is good news for the babies themselves, their parents and the staff involved in their care. The hospital hopes to re-open the unit next week "Being born premature does leave you very vulnerable to infection and it can be a problem, but we're seeing encouraging signs." The babies, who picked up a multi-resistant enterobacter infection, have been isolated and are being closely monitored by specially trained nurses. The health minister said the situation was not acceptable and pointed out there had been much investment in the area of patient safety. "It is one of the issues that we look at ...and it's one of the areas I take very, very seriously," said Mr McGimpsey. "Obviously when people go to hospital they expect not to pick up infection, when they're there. There is an incidence of infections in hospitals and we look to eliminate that because whatever the incidence is, it is ... too high." Iris Robinson of the DUP said she was concerned about the impact on other hospitals. "What I am particularly concerned about is how the other hospitals across the province are going to deal with demand while the Royal's neonatal unit is out of operation," she said. "Usually the most unwell babies from all around Northern Ireland would be transferred to the specialist unit in Belfast. "Obviously this will not be the case for the immediate future, and these cases will have to be managed in their local units."

Professor Louis Appleby has called on NHS trusts to look at new ways of working to help people rebuild lives. He said they should look to work more closely with employment and housing agencies and cut waiting lists for talking therapies in England. Campaigners said there was a lot of work to do to ensure services were good enough for patients. In the last eight years, there has been a big push to move care out of hospitals and into the community. With units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk Marjorie Wallace, of Sane There are now more than 700 community teams, including nurses, doctors and social workers, providing a range of crisis help and early intervention. However, the Healthcare Commission last year criticised services, pointing to gaps in out-of-hours care, talking therapies and access to information. Nearly half of services were rated as fair or weak. Professor Appleby said the report was about the next phase of reform of mental health care. He told BBC News: "We've had several years of strengthening what community services do, and the report is about breaking down the barriers in the next stage of reforms. "I'm talking about barriers that get in the way of better patients' experience of care "At the moment, for example, there is a barrier between what health services traditionally do, which is clinical care, improving people's illnesses, abolishing their symptoms. "But what patients often tell us they want is help with quality of life. They want opportunities for training, for jobs, and for decent housing, and we have to take on that responsibility." His report called on the 60 mental heath trusts to consult with their local populations about what they needed. The report said mental health trusts should look at ways they could link up with agencies responsible for housing and employment. It also called for community teams to get involved in giving people more advice on how to reduce alcohol and drug use and look after their physical health. He also called for a renewed effort to reduce waiting lists for talking therapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy, which sometimes has waits of over 12 months. The NHS is currently rolling out a programme of providing people with access to computerised CBT and the government has set up 10 pilots to explore ways of speeding up access to talking therapies. Marjorie Wallace, chief executive of the mental health charity Sane, said extra investment was needed. "We are all too aware that with units and day centres closing and community services cut, the more seriously ill are still being neglected and put at risk. "The government goes forward with its policy of reform and choice, but there are thousands who have no choice of where to go in crisis and little chance of rehabilitation or safe, consistent care, both in or out of hospital."
