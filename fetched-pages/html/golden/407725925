The blasts underscored the difficulty U.S.-led forces were having in destroying the presumably Sunni insurgent cells that have stepped up car bombings in the capital since the U.S. began its security crackdown 12 weeks ago. "They have actually pushed back," U.S. spokesman Lt. Col. Christopher Garver said, referring to the insurgents. "We've been saying this all along, the enemy is determined." In a sign of that determination, the top U.S. commander in northern Iraq said he doesn't have enough troops to crush al-Qaida-led insurgents in Diyala, a province northeast of Baghdad and scene of recent sharp fighting. Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. Mixon had already received extra troops for Diyala and has increased attacks on militants. But he told Pentagon reporters in a video conference that he has asked Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, the No. 2 commander in Iraq, for more. "I laid out a plan for Gen. Odierno on the numbers of forces that I would need," Mixon said. "We have made progress ... we have taken terrain back from the enemy. Gen. Odierno intends to give me additional forces as they become available." Also Friday, the military announced that two U.S. soldiers were killed in separate bombings the day before. One soldier died in Diyala and the other in Baghdad, the military said. In all, at least 52 Iraqis were killed or found dead Friday in politically related violence. The suicide car bombers struck about 6 p.m. The driver of a sedan waiting in a line of cars at a police checkpoint near the old Diyala Bridge blew up his vehicle, partially collapsing the span, police said. About two minutes later the driver of a large fuel truck barreled toward a second checkpoint at the nearby new Diyala Bridge and set off his explosives, police said. The bridge was also damaged, and firefighters struggled to extinguish burning police and civilian cars that had been driving across during the attack. The blasts sent smoke billowing over the Shiite Zafaraniyah area of southeastern Baghdad. "Suddenly I heard a big explosion, and a huge fire rose from the checkpoint," said Abdullah Khalaf, who was selling sheep by the side of the road when the fuel truck raced past. He ran with his son to the checkpoint and saw the truck and three cars on fire, he said. "I saw one wounded woman asking for help while she was trapped inside a damaged car and three wounded policemen on the ground," he said. "There were pools of blood and pieces of flesh." The bombings at the bridges, which cross the Diyala River, a Tigris tributary, killed 23 people, including 11 police officers, and wounded 57 others, 26 of them police, police said. Baghdad's bridges repeatedly have been targeted by bombers. The most serious had been the April 12 truck bombing that collapsed the steel-girder Sarafiyah bridge, plunging cars into the water and killing 11 people. Two days later, a suicide car bombing killed 10 people at the Jadriyah bridge. Officials say al-Qaida-linked Sunni insurgents are using the bombings to try to provoke retaliatory violence from mainly Shiite militias that had agreed to lay low to avoid confrontations with Americans during the security crackdown. The blasts Friday came despite a series of measures aimed at reducing violence in the capital. U.S. and Iraqi forces have increased checkpoints and, in a bid to prevent bridge attacks, banned trucks capable of carrying more than one ton from crossing without strict searches. They also have long imposed a four-hour weekly driving ban during Friday prayers in Baghdad, but that ban ended on schedule three hours before the attacks. U.S. forces have also tried to break up the insurgent cells behind the bombings. "We have been focusing very heavily on the car bomb factories," Garver said. "We've been targeting the networks and the people that move the bombs and make the bombs as well." In one raid early Friday, troops came under fire as they approached a building near Taji, an air base 12 miles north of Baghdad, suspected of housing a cell responsible for car bomb attacks on civilians and security forces, the military said. The troops returned fire, killing four armed men, including one suspected of being a cell leader with ties to al-Qaida in Iraq's chiefs, the military said. Forces also carried out a series of raids in Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul on Thursday and Friday, detaining nine people suspected of producing bombs and smuggling foreign fighters into the country to carry out attacks against U.S. troops, the military said. In Washington, David Satterfield, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's top adviser for Iraq, said the United States knows for certain that radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr is living next door in Iran. "We know he's out of the country, we don't (merely) think" so, Satterfield told The Associated Press, disputing aides to the anti-American religious and political leader. "He's in Iran, which is where he has been since mid-January." &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Taliban fighters ambushed a patrol of coalition and Afghan forces near Sangin in Helmand province Thursday evening, and gunfire and airstrikes killed 10 militants, said Eizatullah Khan, the Sangin district chief. A coalition spokesman, Sgt. 1st Class Dean Welch, put the toll at six Taliban killed. Two villagers from Sangin said they knew of no civilian casualties in the fight. Airstrikes called in by U.S. Special Forces fighting 200 Taliban militants north of Sangin on Tuesday killed 21 civilians, government officials said, while villagers said nearly 40 civilians were killed. The coalition confirmed that the battle caused civilian casualties, killing at least one child, and that a joint Afghan-U.S. team would investigate. Gen. Dan McNeill, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, told NPR's "Morning Edition" that "it does appear there were civilian casualties" but that it wasn't clear what caused them. He said it was likely the Taliban militants had been firing on coalition forces from civilian homes. Elsewhere, the Taliban released French aid worker Eric Damfreville of Terre d'Enfance after five weeks in captivity, and the militant group credited the release to comments by France's President-elect Nicholas Sarkozy that his country's troops would eventually leave Afghanistan. Damfreville was kidnapped with a female colleague and three Afghans on April 3. The female worker was released last month. There was no word on the fate of the Afghans. The coalition said villagers around Sangin reported detaining 15 Taliban fighters Friday. The coalition said villagers "have become angered with Taliban enemy fighters due to the aftermath of the battle" on Tuesday and that they fear retaliation from the Taliban. Haji Pir Mohammad, a villager from Soro, said 37 people were killed and 21 wounded after aircraft bombed four civilian homes Tuesday. He said 12 family members were killed in one home. Another villager, Mohammad Asif, said earlier this week that 38 civilians died in the airstrikes. Khan, the Sangin district chief, said he did not think the death toll was that high. "There are always people who will say that 40 or 60 people were killed, but the civilian toll appears to be around 20," said Khan. Death tolls in remote battle sites in Afghanistan are nearly impossible to verify. The battle in Sangin was the third incident involving U.S. Special Forces that resulted in civilian deaths since March, sparking outrage among Afghans and a warning from President Hamid Karzai that such incidents can no longer be tolerated. NATO's International Security Assistance Force, which is tasked with counterinsurgency operations, has stressed that its forces were not involved in the incidents. The coalition, which commands U.S. Special Forces units, is tasked with counterterrorism. "We have different missions, different mandates," said Lt. Col. Maria Carl, a spokeswoman for NATO's ISAF. "Many of the ISAF troop-contributing countries are not part of the counterterrorism mission." The counterinsurgency fight involves separating fighters from the general population and helping to improve security and strengthen the Afghan government. The counterterrorism mission involves taking out al-Qaida or Taliban leaders and advanced cells of skilled fighters. Many counterterrorism missions target specific top-level leaders. In March, U.S. Marines Special Forces fired on civilians after a suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan, killing 19 civilians and wounding 50. Fighting late last month killed 50 civilians in the western province of Herat, Afghan and U.N. officials say. The upper house of parliament this week passed a resolution calling for a halt to military action by international troops unless coordinated with the Afghan government, and for negotiations with Taliban fighters. NATO spokesman Nicholas Lunt this week said negotiations should be encouraged if armed groups are prepared to follow Afghanistan's laws and constitution. McNeill told NPR that a cease-fire agreed to in the village of Musa Qala in Helmand province last year "in its best case it might have been a tactical error, in its worst case, might have been a strategic blunder." He said future agreements or negotiations were possible, but that "you'd have to have the right conditions." Elsewhere in southern Afghanistan, Taliban militants attacked two police checkpoints on the main Kabul-Kandahar highway in Zabul province, and 17 police were missing, said Ghulam Rabani, the deputy provincial police chief. Qari Yousef Ahmadi, a purported Taliban spokesman, said the fighters had kidnapped four police. In the east, a suicide or roadside bomb wounded two U.S. troops and damaged two vehicles, said Ghamia Khan, a spokesman for Paktika province's governor. Welch said the injuries were minor.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/UN_ZIMBABWE?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 2:10 PM EDT Zimbabwe Likely to Head Key U.N. Body By EDITH M. LEDERER Zimbabwe Likely to Head Key U.N. Body Zimbabwe Lawyer Decries Intimidation Police Assault Attorneys in Zimbabwe Correction: Corn Prices in Zimbabwe Zimbabwe's Mugabe Warns Catholic Bishops Buy AP Photo Reprints UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Zimbabwe is likely to win approval to head a key U.N. body charged with promoting economic progress and environmental protection despite protests from some Western countries and human rights organizations. The 53-member Commission on Sustainable Development is scheduled to vote Friday on its new chair, U.N. officials said. The chair traditionally rotates among regions of the world, and it is Africa's choice this year. The continent has chosen Zimbabwe as its candidate, and the government has nominated Francis Nhema, the minister of environment and tourism for the post. "For Zimbabwe to lead any U.N. body is preposterous," said Jennifer Windsor, executive director of Freedom House, an independent nongovernmental organization that has monitored political rights and civil liberties in Zimbabwe since 1980. She said President Robert Mugabe's government "clearly has nothing but scorn for the U.N.'s founding principles of human rights, security and international law." Freedom House called on other members of the commission to block Zimbabwe's selection, but that appeared unlikely because of widespread support for the rotation system. Several European nations have called Zimbabwe's candidacy inappropriate, and the United States said Zimbabwe would not be an effective leader of the commission. "Zimbabwe is hardly a model of good governance or sustainable development or even responsible leadership," said Benjamin Chang, deputy spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. "Our concern is that it's potential chairmanship would undermine the commission's credibility," he said. "The commission is to address themes such as sustainable agriculture and rural development at a time when Zimbabwe's government has turned the country from the breadbasket of southern African to the country with the highest rate of inflation and a decimated agriculture sector." The commission was established by the General Assembly in December 1992 to ensure effective follow-up of the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in June that year and implementation of key environmental and development agreements. The commission meets annually in New York, and its current session that opened Wednesday is focusing on energy for sustainable development, industrial development, air pollution and climate change. Mugabe, an 83-year-old former anti-colonial rebel who has ruled Zimbabwe since it gained independence from Britain in 1980, has acknowledged that police used violent methods against opposition supporters and killed at least one activist. He has warned alleged perpetrators of unrest that they would be "bashed" again if violence continued. Zimbabwe's ruling party has endorsed Mugabe as its candidate in next year's presidential election. Victory would allow him to stay in power until 2013, when he would be nearly 90. On Friday, the Pan African Parliament, a body of the African Union, voted to send a mission to Zimbabwe to investigate alleged human rights abuses "relating to the arrests and detention, assault and murder of political activists and members of the media."

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BRITAIN_BLAIR_BROWN?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 3:09 PM EDT Brown Vows to Learn From Iraq Mistakes Latest News from Britain Iraqi President: U.S. Troops Should Stay Brown Vows to Learn From Iraq Mistakes No Disciplinary Action for London Police Blair Formally Endorses Brown to Be PM Britain to Hand Over Aboriginal Remains Blair Legacy: Reform, Peace, War Buy AP Photo Reprints LONDON (AP) -- Gordon Brown signaled a shift in policy in Iraq and a new vision for Britain as he launched his campaign Friday to become the country's next prime minister. Appearing before a standing ovation of hand-picked supporters only hours after Prime Minister Tony Blair formally endorsed his candidacy, Brown, who has waited more than a decade for his chance to lead the country, strode to the podium and confidently laid out a platform that promised to be both compassionate and tough. "I will listen, and I will learn. I will strive to meet people's aspirations," Brown said, pledging to win back disenchanted voters. "I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place." Brown signaled that as prime minister, he would abandon Blair's presidential style of leadership by restoring Parliament's authority in decisions such as when to go to war. Government must be accountable, he said. "I accept that mistakes have been made," Brown said, without offering specifics. "We will keep our obligations to the Iraqi people. These are obligations that are part of U.N. resolution, they are in support of a democracy. I do think that over the next few months the emphasis will shift." The question is how much Brown will shift Britain's role in the Iraq war, which has divided the country. He indicated he wants to devote more time and resources toward the creation of jobs and basic services for the Iraqi people. "There are too many people in Iraq who don't have a stake in the economic future of the country, too many people unemployed, too many people who are not seeing services developed ... and therefore too many people who don't feel loyalty to the regime," he said. Brown did not outline specifics on his Iraq policy. He said he will make his first trip to Iraq in the coming weeks to inspect the situation. Blair announced in February that his government - the top U.S. ally in the Iraq war - will reduce its troop level by 1,600 to about 5,500 by spring, but will retain a presence in southern Iraq until at least 2008. A total of 148 British soldiers have died since the 2003 invasion. Brown also promised to be strong on defense and security. "And obviously we've got to do more to win the battle of hearts and minds against al-Qaida terrorism," he said. Brown's speech at a converted Edwardian-era school in central London was the first act in his campaign to become Labour Party chief - and as a result, British leader. It also marked Brown's first effort to emerge from the shadow of the telegenic Blair - a challenge for the wonkish Brown, who must show he can connect with voters. The campaign to revamp the Treasury chief's rumpled image hit an immediate snag when the teleprompters he was using obscured his face for the live television audience. He seemed more relaxed shaking hands of the party faithful in later televised appearances. Brown took the London subway, known as the Tube, to the event, impressing at least one Londoner, 20-year-old student Rohini Simbodyal. "We got on the Tube and people were looking at Gordon Brown," Simbodyal said. "People were amazed, saying, 'It's Gordon.' But everyone was very British, they looked and then looked away. A few people came up and shook his hand and said, 'Good luck.'" "He was just like a normal guy," she said. President Bush also praised Brown's forthrightness, describing him as "easy to talk to." But it remains to be seen how close the two men might become. Brown has been more reserved in his comments about Bush, whose alliance with Blair cost the Labour Party votes. Bush and Blair have had a close relationship, speaking regularly by phone and videoconference and getting together for talks at least twice a year since 2003. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Brown was aware of the dangers surrounding failure in Iraq, and she didn't expect U.S.-British relations to change dramatically. "Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we will work very, very well with Gordon Brown when he becomes prime minister," Rice told the British Broadcasting Corp. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

Korea Iran, U.S. Court Gulf Arab Allies Denmark: Iran Would Compensate Attack Iranian-American Being Held in Prison Iranian Fighter Jet Crash Kills 1 Ahmadinejad's Letter to President Bush Buy AP Photo Reprints TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's foreign minister said North Korea's debts stand in the way of improving ties between the two countries - both U.S. foes under international pressure over their nuclear programs. It was the first time an official of either country referred to their dealings, which go back to at least the 1980s but are not publicly known. The extent of North Korea's debts to Iran remain unknown. North Korea's "debts to Tehran are among the obstacles in the way of cooperation," the official IRNA news agency quoted Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as saying Friday. "The two countries can find a formula to remove this obstacle." Mottaki met late Thursday with North Korean acting Foreign Minister Kim Yong Il. He added that Iran was still interested in improving ties with North Korea "in the fields of politics, economics and culture" with North Korea. Kim said his country was ready to cooperate with Iran "in various economic fields" and support the country on the international level. On Friday, Vice President Dick Cheney issued a warning to Iran while aboard an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, saying the United States would join allies "to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region." The U.N. Security Council has imposed two sets of sanctions against Iran for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment, a process that can produce fuel for nuclear reactors or the material for atomic bombs. Iran, which denies it is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, has another deadline later this month to freeze enrichment or face tighter sanctions. The Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea last year for conducting its first nuclear weapons test. North Korea has since refused to act on a February pledge to start dismantling its nuclear program in exchange for economic aid and political concessions. The North Korean government is believed to have cooperated with Iran militarily since early 1980s, when Saddam Hussein waged an eight-year war against Iran.

SIMPSON Pope Canonizes First Brazilian Saint Pope News Conference Causes Stir Pope to Canonize First Brazilian Saint Pope Visits Brazil, Church Loses Ground Official Says Amazon Dams on Fast Track Pope Canonizes First Brazilian Saint Pope News Conference Causes Stir Wartime Pope Edges Closer to Sainthood Pope Says He Suppports Excommunication Pope to Canonize First Brazilian Saint Pope Benedict's trip to Latin America Buy AP Photo Reprints Justice Delayed: Latin America's Dirty Wars Leaning Left: Political Changes in Latin America 2 Men Leave Russia Embassy in Costa Rica Pope Canonizes First Brazilian Saint Haiti Immigrants Angry With Boat Sinking Man Storms Russia's Costa Rica Embassy Cuba Accuses U.S. of Violating Treaties SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Pope Benedict XVI castigated popular culture for promoting sexual immorality Friday as he canonized Brazil's first native-born saint before hundreds of thousands of faithful and a sea of flags in the world's largest Roman Catholic nation. Holding up Friar Antonio de Sant'Anna Galvao as a model of rectitude and humility "in an age so full of hedonism," Benedict said the world needs clear souls and pure minds, adding: "It is necessary to oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage." Benedict didn't elaborate, but his message for Brazilian Catholics reflected his uneasiness with the impact of popular culture on young people. Earlier this year, Benedict declared that "any trend to produce programs and products - including animated films and video games - which in the name of entertainment exalt violence and portray anti-social behavior or the trivialization of human sexuality is a perversion." Later, meeting with the country's 430 bishop's in Sao Paulo's cathedral, Benedict lamented that Brazil is in the midst of "difficult times for the church" amid "aggressive proselytizing" by born-again Protestant congregations. The census says the percentage of Brazilians characterizing themselves as Catholics dropped from 89 percent in 1980 to 74 percent in 2000, while those calling themselves evangelical Protestants rose from 7 percent to 15 percent. Benedict's message on immorality could be a tough sell in hedonistic Brazil. Sex before marriage is common. Scantily clad actresses are the norm on hugely popular TV soap operas, and most women on Brazil's famed beaches wear bikinis that leave so little to the imagination. "Nothing could be more countercultural than his message in Brazil, the land of the thong," said David Gibson, author of "The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World." Brazilian news media said the crowd reached about 1 million - as church officials had hoped for - although there were large empty spaces on the airfield in South America's largest city. Benedict pronounced the sainthood of Galvao, a Franciscan monk credited by the church with 5,000 miracle cures, while he sat on a throne of Brazilian hardwood, surrounded by Latin American bishops and choirs of hundreds. Galvao is the first native-born saint from Brazil, home to more than 120 million of the planet's 1.1 billion Catholics, and the 10th to be canonized by Benedict. His canonization continues a push for saints in Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world that began under John Paul II, who sought role models as part of the church's worldwide reach. John Paul canonized more saints than all of his predecessors combined. "Do you realize how big this is?" asked Herminia Fernandes, who joined the multitude at the airfield for the open-air Mass. "It's huge, this pope is visiting Brazil for the first time and at the same time he is giving us a saint. It's a blessing." Galvao, who died in 1822, began a tradition among Brazilian Catholics of handing out tiny rice-paper pills, inscribed with a Latin prayer, to people seeking cures for everything from cancer to kidney stones. Although doctors and even some Catholic clergy dismiss the pills as placebos or superstitious fakery, cloistered nuns still toil in the Sao Paulo monastery where Galvao is buried, preparing thousands of the pills for free daily distribution. Each one carries these words: "After birth, the Virgin remained intact. Mother of God, intercede on our behalf." After canonizing Galvao, the pope hugged Sandra Grossi de Almeida, 37, and her son Enzo, 7. She is one of two Brazilian women certified by the Vatican as divinely inspired miracles justifying the sainthood. She had a uterine malformation that should have made it impossible for her to carry a child for more than four months, but after taking the pills, she gave birth to Enzo. "I have faith," Grossi recently told The Associated Press. "I believe in God, and the proof is right here." Benedict's trip has so far focused on reinforcing church doctrine on abortion, sexual morality and euthanasia. At a rally Thursday night, he instructed young Catholics to avoid premarital sex, remain faithful once they are married and to promote life from "its beginning to natural end." The latter was - at least in part - a reference to abortion, the issue that has dominated Benedict's first papal visit to Latin America. The pope also warned against drug use, violence, corruption and the temptations of wealth and power - themes sure to resonate across the region. Benedict, now 80, a pianist and lover of Mozart, showed his suspicions about popular culture in the 1990s when he acknowledged publicly he was opposed to a performance by Bob Dylan for John Paul II in Bologna, Italy. He said Dylan and other rock performers at the event were committed to a different message than John Paul's and he saw no reason for such so-called "prophets" to intervene. The pope heads Friday evening to the shrine city of Aparecida, about 100 miles from Sao Paulo, where he will visit a drug treatment center Saturday and open a conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops on Sunday. Aparecida is the most important Catholic religious site in Brazil, home to the mammoth Basilica of Aparecida and the 3-foot statue of a black Virgin Mary called "Our Lady Who Appeared," the patron saint of Brazil. The statue was pulled from a river in the 18th century by poor fishermen who were not catching any fish, and then caught loads in their nets. Miracles were subsequently attributed to the statue, and so many pilgrims flocked to Aparecida that the church built the basilica and inaugurated it as a shrine in 1955.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/J/JAPAN_BREAST_FEEDING?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 2:07 PM EDT Japan Scraps Plan to Urge Breast-Feeding Japan Scraps Plan to Urge Breast-Feeding Japan Has Drop Box for Unwanted Babies Report: Japan Moves Toward Resuming Aid Offices of Cult Splinter Group Raided Japan Rules Against War Claims Buy AP Photo Reprints TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese proposal to urge mothers to breast-feed their babies and sing lullabies to children was scrapped after critics warned it was too intrusive, a news report said. The proposal, which would also have recommended parents limit their children's television viewing and promote age-appropriate morals, was to have been announced Friday by an education reform panel named by the government. But experts and some government officials said the measure was "beyond intrusive," and interfered in people's private lives, Kyodo News agency said Thursday, citing unnamed individuals close to the panel. Japanese breastfeeding rates are much lower than those in other developed countries, according to various studies cited in a 2006 article in the International Breastfeeding Journal. The comparitive studies said in 2000 the full breastfeeding rate in Japan for infants aged 1 to 2 months was 44.8 percent compared to the U.S. rate of 54.7 percent at 1 month and and Sweden at 80.2 percent at 2 months. Another study of infants aged 3 to 6 months in Nishinomiya City, Japan, found that 43.8 percent of infants were fed breast milk only. These breast-feeding rates still remain lower than the U.S with 47 percent breastfed at 3 months. Education reform has been a key party of conservative Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's agenda since he took office in September. In December, Parliament passed a reform measure that called on schools to "to cultivate an attitude that respects tradition and culture, that loves the nation and home country." The legislation reflected concerns voiced by Abe that Japan's long stretch of economic prosperity has eroded the morals and cooperative spirit of prewar Japanese. Concerns have also been rife about Japan's falling birth rate. Earlier this month, the government said that Japan's child population has fallen to a record low since the end of World War II. To encourage more couples to have children, Abe's government has adopted plans for increasing child care, promoting gender equality and encouraging companies to allow staff more time for family responsibilities. But many opt to have few or no children because of the high cost of raising them and the persisting social expectations for women to quit their jobs after giving birth. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/K/KOREAS_TALKS?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 8:10 AM EDT Koreas Adopt Military Agreement Buy AP Photo Reprints North Korea's Missile Arsenal The Last Stalinist State Iran Seeks Improved Ties With N. Korea Chances Slim for Return of USS Pueblo N. Korea Wants U.S. Bank to Handle Funds SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea adopted a military agreement Friday enabling the first train crossing of their heavily armed border in more than half a century, the South's Defense Ministry said. The rail test, planned for Thursday, would be the first time trains have crossed the tightly sealed border since inter-Korean rail links were severed in the middle of the 1950-53 Korean War. Two tracks have been reconnected as part of a series of reconciliation projects launched since the two sides held the first-ever summit of their leaders in 2000. The test would be just a single run of trains along the restored tracks on each side of the peninsula, with regular train service between the two sides unlikely to begin anytime soon. The two Koreas had agreed in principle on security for the rail test earlier this week, but the adoption of a formal agreement came only after more than 30 hours of extended talks that stretched into Friday due to unspecified sticking points. South Korea hopes the inter-Korean railways could ultimately be linked to Russia's Trans-Siberian railroad, and could allow an overland route connecting the peninsula to Europe - significantly cutting delivery times for freight that now requires sea transport. Economic officials from both sides agreed last month to conduct the train run, but North Korea's military had the final say on whether it goes forward because such a border crossing requires security arrangements. The security accord sets out protocols for the train crossings next week, including what areas of the border should open and for how long, as well as pledges from each side to guarantee travelers' safety. South Korea had hoped to expand the agreement to cover similar future border crossings, but the North refused. The two sides also agreed in principle to set up a joint fishing area around their disputed western sea border and continue talks on that issue and other measures aimed at preventing accidental clashes in the area, according to a joint statement summarizing the negotiations' outcome. North Korea doesn't recognize the current sea border demarcated by the United Nations at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, and has long claimed it should be further south. The waters around the border are rich fishing grounds and boats from the two Koreas routinely jostle for position during the May-June crab-catching season. In 1999 and 2002, their navies fought deadly skirmishes, killing several sailors and sinking six ships. The two sides agreed to hold the next general-level talks in July and continue discussions to set up a defense ministers' meeting, the joint statement said. This week's talks were the first high-level military contacts between the two sides in a year. The two Koreas remain technically at war because the Korean War ended in a cease-fire that has never been replaced with a peace treaty. Ties between the two sides have warmed significantly since the 2000 summit, although they suffered during the international standoff over North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Pyongyang conducted its first-ever nuclear test in October, chilling relations with the South. But the South began reaching out again to the North after Pyongyang agreed in February to shut down its nuclear reactor under an agreement with the United States and four other neighboring countries. Still, the communist regime missed an April deadline to close the reactor because of a separate financial dispute with the United States, and it is unclear when it will close down the facility. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GERMANY_SEPT_11_TRIAL?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 2:35 PM EDT Sept. 11 Suspect Loses Appeal in Germany Sept. 11 Suspect Loses Appeal in Germany Protests in Germany Over Raids Shredded East German Files Reassembled Museum Created for Germans Who Hid Jews Clemency Plea by German Terrorist Fails Buy AP Photo Reprints BERLIN (AP) -- A Moroccan convicted of helping three of the Sept. 11 suicide pilots in their plot lost his final chance to appeal in Germany when the country's top criminal court announced Friday that it had refused to hear his case. Mounir el Motassadeq, 33, was convicted in November of being an accessory to the murder of the 246 passengers and crew on the four jetliners used in the 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the maximum penalty possible under German law. Germany's Federal Court of Justice said in a short statement Friday that it had decided on May 2 that el Motassadeq's appeal was "unfounded." "Therefore the verdict against the defendant el Motassadeq is legally binding," the court said. It did not provide further details. The decision was the final step in what has been a long trip through the German legal system that began when el Motassadeq was arrested two months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He has gone through two full trials. Even though all appeals are now exhausted, el Motassadeq's attorney Udo Jacob said he would petition the original Hamburg court to reopen the case, which it is highly unlikely to do. He also said he would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, arguing that el Motassadeq did not receive a fair trial because of the lack of evidence from al-Qaida suspects in U.S. custody. "He knew nothing of the attack plans, but how can one prove that one didn't know something?" Jacob said. A spokeswoman for the Court of Human Rights, Stephanie Klein, refused to speculate on whether it would hear the case, but said it has taken up cases in the past concerning witness issues. Dominic Puopolo Jr., whose mother died aboard one of the hijacked airliners, said he was pleased with the German court's decision. "It's been a long journey and it's good to know we're getting close to the end," he said, adding he was now moving ahead with a civil suit against the Moroccan. "We're not going to walk away from this - ever," Puopolo said in a telephone interview from Miami Beach, Fla., where he lives. "My mother's dead and she's never coming back and this person's actions changed the lives of thousands of families. It's unacceptable." El Motassadeq was first convicted and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison in 2003, but that verdict was overturned by a federal court the following year, largely because of the lack of testimony from witnesses in U.S. custody. At a retrial in 2005, the U.S. provided limited summaries from the interrogation of, among others, Ramzi Binalshibh, a suspected liaison between the Hamburg hijackers and al-Qaida. The Hamburg court acquitted el Motassadeq of direct involvement in the attacks, but sentenced him to seven years for belonging to a terrorist group. Prosecutors appealed the decision, and in November the Federal Court of Justice ruled that evidence showed el Motassadeq was aware Hamburg-based hijackers Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah planned to hijack and crash planes, even though he might not have known the specifics of the plot. It convicted him of 246 counts of accessory to murder in addition to the membership in a terrorist organization charge. Judge Klaus Tolksdorf ruled then that el Motassadeq had helped "watch the attackers' backs and conceal them" by helping them keep up the appearance of being regular university students - paying tuition and rent fees, and transferring money. Tolksdorf said it was irrelevant to el Motassadeq's guilt whether he knew of the planned timing, dimension or targets of the attacks. In January, Germany's constitutional court refused to hear a separate appeal in which el Motassadeq's attorneys claimed that evidence from other terrorism suspects was not properly considered at his trial. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

With 10 Palestinians wounded over a two-day period, it was the worst factional fighting since the formation of the Hamas-Fatah unity government nearly two months ago. Despite the growing tensions, it was unlikely the coalition would break apart soon because neither party can govern alone or is eager to go to elections. Later Friday, six members of Hamas' militia were wounded in a family feud that appeared unrelated to its rivalry with Fatah, Palestinian security officials said. The factional tensions flared Thursday after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas ordered the deployment of about 3,000 police in Gaza City. The troops took up positions at main intersections and government buildings. Hamas was upset that Abbas, the Fatah leader, has not coordinated the new deployment with them. On Friday, Prime Minister Ismail Haniyeh canceled a scheduled meeting with senior security commanders in an apparent show of displeasure. Despite the renewed tensions, Abbas was to leave Gaza for the West Bank on Saturday. After many months of clashes between the sides, some Gazans are skeptical that the new police deployment would stem the unrest. "They look good. But can they do anything? I doubt that very much," Badar Salim, 45, a Gaza City merchant said. "I hope this is something real, not just a show for the media." The plan includes a joint operations room to be staffed by members of various security forces as well a joint security unit, said Ghazi Hamad, Haniyeh's spokesman. Hamad also said security commanders would hold meetings with leaders of Gaza's political parties and militant groups to maintain calm. "Lawlessness and chaos have become very dangerous in Gaza, and all the participants are determined to end the chaos and restore security," he said. Friday's clashes began before dawn when a minibus filled with Hamas gunmen opened fire at a Fatah security force manning a new roadblock. Palestinian medical officials said at least four people were wounded in the exchange. In another attack, gunmen opened fire at the national security building in central Gaza and in the northern Gaza Strip two men were wounded when Hamas gunmen opened fire at their car. Since Israel withdrew from Gaza in 2005, the area has experienced a wave of infighting, armed robberies, deadly family feuds and kidnappings. Attempts to halt the violence have failed, and the interior minister in the new Palestinian coalition government, Hani Kawasmeh, has threatened to resign because his plan for restoring security has not been carried out. Hamas and Fatah formed a unity government in March with the aim of restoring calm. The alliance has brought a lull in factional fighting, but crime and violence remain rampant in Gaza. Despite their power-sharing deal, Hamas and Fatah remain at odds over control over security forces. Hamas has its own force, and it was unclear how it would fit into the security plan. Fatah has long demanded that the Hamas force be dismantled, but Hamas has refused. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The April trade gap of $16.88 billion was below February's $23.7 billion - the second-highest level on record - but in line with steady increases in monthly trade surpluses over the past year. Chinese and U.S. trade envoys are due to meet May 23-24 in Washington for talks on Beijing's surpluses, currency controls, product piracy and other contentious issues. Some U.S. lawmakers are pushing for punitive tariffs on imports of Chinese goods if Beijing fails to ease currency controls that critics say keep its currency undervalued, giving exporters an unfair price advantage and adding to China's trade surpluses. Washington is hoping the "strategic economic dialogue," led by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Chinese Vice Premier Wu Yi, helps to mollify critics and avert disruption in trade ties. Chinese President Hu Jintao made an unusual personal lobbying effort for the talks this week, expressing hopes for "positive progress" in a phone call with President Bush. The Chinese government say it is not actively pursuing such large surpluses and has taken steps to rein in exports. Beijing also is trying to reduce reliance on exports by encouraging more domestic consumer spending, which could boost imports and narrow the trade gap. But an official campaign under way to cool off an economic boom has cut imports of factory equipment and other goods while foreign demand for low-cost Chinese products has surged ahead. Exports in April rose 26.8 percent, while imports rose 21.3 percent, the General Administration of Customs said on its Web site. The government reported a monthly trade surplus of just $6.9 billion in March. Economists had projected a sharp jump in the trade surplus from March to April. They said the February surge was caused by exporters shipping more goods early to beat an expected change in taxes, leaving less to ship in March. The April figure raised the country's accumulated trade surplus so far this year to $63 billion, the customs agency said. China reported a global trade surplus in 2006 of $177.5 billion. The Asian Development Bank said in a report in March that figure could balloon to more than $250 billion next year. Last year, the United States reported a record $232.5 billion trade deficit with China. China's gap with the United States is bigger than its global surplus because it runs deficits with other countries. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The United States and European Union were alarmed this week by the election of a Milosevic admirer to the position of parliamentary speaker - the No. 2 post in the country - fearing a resurgence of the ultranationalists who led Serbia to four bloody wars in the 1990s. The Radicals are staunchly anti-Western and used to back Milosevic's aggressive policies in the Balkans, while their own boss, Vojislav Seselj, is awaiting trial at the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands. The Radicals also oppose the Western-backed U.N. plan for the Serbian province of Kosovo, which envisages internationally supervised self-rule. But President Boris Tadic said in a statement late Friday that three pro-Western parties had signed the power-sharing agreement, ensuring the Radicals would not have a place in the government. He named current caretaker Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica as the premier designate, and said a parliament session to approve the new government will be held Sunday, state TV said. Dusan Petrovic, a Democratic Party negotiator, said the agreement was reached during an overnight meeting between Tadic and Kostunica, and it includes an initiative to replace Tomislav Nikolic as parliament speaker during Sunday's assembly session. Kostunica's conservatives had supported Nikolic's election to the post on Tuesday. Earlier Friday, Nikolic told The Associated Press that he would resign rather than be replaced. He also said he believed the power-sharing deal would not last long and the nationalists would triumph in the next general election in the country. "The only thing keeping them together is pressure and blackmail (from abroad)," Nikolic said. "They do not share the same ideology. ... We will have another crisis soon." If the government is not formed by Tuesday, new general elections would have to be called, which would benefit the Radicals who are already the biggest group in the parliament. A Jan. 21 parliamentary vote was inconclusive; no party achieved a majority to rule alone. U.S. Undersecretary of State Nicholas Burns, attending a Balkan summit in Croatia, welcomed the power-sharing agreement, saying Washington supports "any democratic government that doesn't include the Radicals." "I think it's very clear that if the Radicals come back to power, that would seriously harm relations of Serbia with the United States and with all of the European countries," he said. The European Union Enlargement Commissioner, Olli Rehn, said that once the pro-democratic government is in place, the EU would "immediately" restart its pre-membership talks with Serbia. "I trust the leaders of Serbia's democratic forces now realize their responsibility and choose a European future for Serbia, instead of letting the country fall back to its nationalist past," he said in a statement. The talks were suspended a year ago due to Belgrade's failure to extradite Gen. Ratko Mladic, a wartime commander sought by the U.N. tribunal in The Hague for atrocities during the 1992-95 war in Bosnia. Rehn said the EU still insists on Mladic's arrest, adding that talks would not be completed without his extradition. Nikolic said he believed the Tadic-Kostunica government would split over the fate of Kosovo - Serbia's historic heartland that would be granted supervised independence according to a Western-backed resolution to be voted on at the U.N. Security Council in the coming weeks. Western nations support independence for Kosovo, rejecting Serbia's offer of a broad autonomy for the ethnic Albanian-dominated region. Russia, however, has sided with Serbia in the dispute, leading to fears of a standoff in the Security Council. But Nikolic ruled out going to a war over Kosovo, saying "Serbia, of course, cannot start wars nor does it want to." "But we have to tell the world that we will never accept independence for Kosovo and that we will forever consider it part of Serbia's territory," he added. Serbia also took over the six-month Council of Europe chairmanship Friday. But questions prevailed over Serbia's suitability to run the continent's premier human rights watchdog because it has failed to meet its main obligation to the council - the arrest of Mladic. Council of Europe chief Terry Davis defended Serbia's chairmanship, saying that traditionally every member state in turn gets to run the organization.

Just a few minutes past midnight, all three radioed air traffic control to check the weather report. They were told the storm would take another hour to dissipate, and the Cameroon Airlines and Royal Air Maroc crews opted to wait it out. But Capt. Francis Mbatia Wamwea of Kenya Airways Flight 507, already delayed for an hour and carrying scores of passengers with onward connections to catch, judged the weather had improved sufficiently to permit departure for Nairobi, Kenya. Less than a minute after takeoff early on May 5, the Boeing 737-900 slammed into a jungle swamp during a raging storm, killing all 105 passengers and the nine-member crew. The dead included Dr. Albert Henn, an AIDS expert who worked at Harvard University and had a home in Barnstable, Mass.; businesspeople from China, India and South Africa; Cameroonian merchants; a Tanzanian returning from peacekeeping duties in Ivory Coast; a U.N. refugee worker from Togo; and Anthony Mitchell, a Nairobi-based correspondent for The Associated Press. The six-month-old plane was of the newest generation of the world's most popular airliner, which has an excellent safety record. It was only the second time a 737-800 has crashed with the loss of all on board. In September, a plane belonging to Brazil's Gol Airlines collided with an executive jet over the Amazon jungle, killing 154. After Wamwea gave the go-ahead, the Kenyan Airways crew radioed the tower, pulled away from the gate, and taxied toward Runway 12, heading roughly southeast from the airport. The Douala tower cleared the flight for takeoff a few minutes later, instructing it to report on reaching 5,000 feet. The pilot acknowledged the clearance from the tower. It's unclear what time that final voice transmission was received from the jet, but the plane nose-dived into a swamp on the outskirts of Cameroon's commercial hub only 30 seconds after becoming airborne. Wamwea's decision to depart into one of the violent tropical storms that regularly ravage equatorial Africa during the rainy season was most likely the pivotal factor in a sequence of events that led to the crash, said a Cameroonian investigator and a government pilot assisting the probe of Flight 507, both speaking on condition of anonymity because the inquiry was still under way. Kenya Airways chief executive Titus Naikuni said investigators would have to make the final assessment. The probe was likely to take months. "We don't want to start speculating here," he said Friday in Kenya. "So whether the pilot did the wrong thing or the right thing, I cannot answer that." Investigators said they cannot yet discount other factors, including mechanical failure, pilot disorientation or even sabotage. But no sign of a blast or fire has been found so far by the search teams, which include seven experts from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and two Boeing representatives. Flight crews are responsible for the decision whether to take off or land in bad weather, usually depending on guidelines from their airline. And while air traffic control can take measures to halt flights, including closing down airports, such drastic actions are highly unusual outside the northern hemisphere, where heavy winter snows can block runways and bring traffic to a standstill. The Douala airport is not equipped with weather radar, but the 737-800 is. Pilots routinely take off into stormy weather and then rely on radar to guide them around the towering thunderheads that can cause structural damage to aircraft. Controllers had told the jet to turn slightly to the left after leaving the runway, a Kenyan official said. The location of the wreckage indicated the jet turned to the right, a sign that the pilot may have changed course because of the weather the plane encountered. Wamwea, 53, was an experienced flier with about 8,500 hours on jets. He had joined Kenya Airways 20 years ago and enjoyed the reputation of a diligent and professional pilot. The co-pilot, Andrew Kiuru, was only 23 and had joined the airline a year ago after completing flight school in South Africa. The cockpit voice recorder has not been found, so no details of the final exchanges between Wamwea and Kiuru are available. It remains unclear who was flying the plane at the time, but Wamwea would have had the ultimate authority. The flight data recorder has been recovered. Two minutes after Flight 507 would have been expected to reach 5,000 feet, the point at which it had been instructed to check in, Douala Area Control Center issued a distress message. This is normal practice by air traffic control when unable to establish immediate contact with an aircraft, a frequent occurrence. But controllers, who had lost sight of the plane fairly quickly because of the storm, were not unduly worried because the plane had fuel for six hours of flying time. A search was launched at 2:44 a.m. when a French radar station sent in a message that an airplane distress signal had been picked up. A Cameroonian air force plane and two helicopters first flew over a region far to the south, basing their search on the distress signal that was in fact hundreds of miles away from the actual crash. It is unclear why the signal was so far off the mark, but it appears the plane's emergency locator beacon's final signal was garbled - indicating a false position. The wreckage was found 40 hours after takeoff by a hunter who chanced upon it in a mangrove swamp. The site is less than 3 1/2 miles from Runway 12. Experts calculate that the plane was in the air for only 30 seconds and had never climbed over 3,000 feet. Commercial jets regularly fly over the area, one of several standard departure routes from Runway 12. Villagers living nearby said they heard planes passing overhead during the night - and a particularly loud boom that sounded like a thunderclap. Since there were no witnesses to the crash, investigators have pieced together the known facts and formulated several theories on what could have happened. The wreckage indicated the plane flew nose-first into the ground at a nearly 90-degree angle. It was found buried deep in a crater of reddish-brown muck with only tiny bits of the rear fuselage and wings left above ground. Trees nearby were smashed, but otherwise the jungle canopy was intact, making the site almost invisible from the air. Investigators said the nose dive indicated that a violent gust of wind may have flipped the airliner over, throwing it into a fatal fall. Although modern jets can usually fly through storm clouds, storms in Africa are particularly violent at this time of the year, investigators said. The location of the wreckage also indicates the pilot was banking sharply to the right. This would have exposed the raised left wing to the gust, investigators said. The low altitude would have made it impossible to recover from the resulting dive.

Korea Iran, U.S. Court Gulf Arab Allies Denmark: Iran Would Compensate Attack Iranian-American Being Held in Prison Iranian Fighter Jet Crash Kills 1 Ahmadinejad's Letter to President Bush Buy AP Photo Reprints VIENNA, Austria (AP) -- Iran on Friday accused the United States of being the true violator of the Nonproliferation Treaty as a global conference ended without managing to bridge conflicting priorities on how to tighten the pact meant to prevent the spread of nuclear arms. The United States and the European Union, in turn criticized Tehran for hamstringing the 106-nation meeting for a week by blocking consensus adoption of its agenda because of a phrase calling for the "need for full compliance" with the treaty. Diplomats accredited to the conference said Iran felt that wording would allow it to be targeted for its defiance of the U.N. Security Council. Differences were reflected to the last minutes of the meeting by the failure of delegates Friday to adopt the Japanese "chairman's factual summary" - Yukiya Amano's review of the debates initiated and documents submitted at the 130-nation meeting since its opening April 30. The document was to have been annexed to the meeting's concluding report. But opposition from nonaligned nations, which felt it did not reflect their priorities and from Tehran, which opposed mention of "serious concern ... expressed over Iran's nuclear program," led it to be listed only as one of dozens of documents submitted at the meeting. Since the outset of the meeting, Iran has been a major issue, with Tehran defending its nuclear record and the United States and its allies accusing it of breaching the treaty. The summary dedicated only one of its 59 paragraphs to Iran, noting that Tehran was urged to comply with U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for a halt of its uranium enrichment program. Still, that was too much for Iran. And while nonaligned delegates did not specify their opposition, several said the summary was "not factual enough." That indicated they did not share the priorities of nuclear weapons states, whose main nonproliferation focus is tightening the rules on nuclear technology in an attempt to prevent non-weapons states from acquiring the capacity to make such arms. Chief U.S. delegate Christopher A. Ford said the "summary inadequately reflects ... the well-merited criticism that Iran has faced" at the conference - an allusion to Tehran's obstruction to adoption of the agenda. A European Union statement also targeted Iran for "unjustifiable objections" to the agenda, while France was also critical. The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty calls on nations to pledge not to pursue nuclear weapons in exchange for a commitment by five nuclear powers - the U.S., Russia, Britain, France and China - to move toward nuclear disarmament. Turning the tables on the United States, whose delegation had accused Tehran of violating the treaty by nuclear activities that point to a desire to develop an arms program, chief Iranian representative Ali Ashgar Soltanieh said Washington and its allies "are in violation" of the treaty. "The message at this conference is deploring the capabilities of weapons states and noncompliance of their obligations" to disarm," he told reporters. Iran argues it is entitled to enrich uranium under the treaty provision giving all pact members the right to develop peaceful programs. But suspicions bred by nearly two decades of clandestine nuclear activities, including questionable black-market acquisitions of equipment and blueprints that appear linked to weapons plans, have led to U.N. sanctions over its refusal to freeze enrichment. Tehran's ultimate goal is to have 50,000 enriching centrifuges at the underground Natanz facility. That would be enough to supply fuel for what Iran says is a planned network of atomic reactors to generate electricity. Or it could produce material for a full-scale nuclear weapons program. Iran denies it has any plans to make weapons, asserting it wants to enrich uranium - which can produce the fissile material for nuclear warheads - purely to generate nuclear power, and describes its other activities as also serving solely peaceful aims. In Tehran, top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani warned that Iran would not suspend enrichment as a precondition to talks meant to reach a compromise over its nuclear program. Senior diplomats from the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and Germany held talks in Berlin on Thursday. German officials said the meeting was preparation for another round of talks between European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana and Larijani. After meeting late last month, Solana and Larijani spoke of some progress and agreed to meet again within weeks in hopes of finding enough common ground to serve as the basis of renewed talks between Tehran and the six countries. Also on Friday, Vice President Dick Cheney issued a warning to Iran while aboard an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, saying the United States would join allies to keep Iran from getting nuclear weapons "and dominating the region." &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

The show, featuring a giant black-and-white rodent with a high-pitched voice, made headlines worldwide because the character has preached against Israel and the U.S. and urged Palestinian children to fight Israel. It is broadcast on Hamas-affiliated Al Aqsa TV. Hamas, which is sworn to Israel's destruction, shares power in the Palestinian government with the moderate Fatah movement of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. Palestinian Information Minister Mustafa Barghouti, an independent, said Wednesday that the show reflects a "mistaken approach" to the Palestinian struggle for independence and would be suspended immediately to allow for a review. But the station's manager, Hazem al-Sharawi, said on Friday the show called "Tomorrow's Pioneers" has an educational message and will not be canceled. Barghouti would only say Friday that the station had promised to correct any problems. He said he has no control over private stations, but has asked the station to review the content. If there are still violations, "we will continue to work with them," he added. Israeli officials have denounced the program as incendiary and outrageous. The program was also opposed by the Palestinian Broadcasting Corp., which is controlled by Fatah. The lead character is called "farfour" or butterfly in Arabic, but is an unmistakable copy of the Disney character. On Friday, the character said he cheated on his exams because "the Jews destroyed my house," and he lost his books under the rubble. Children called in telling him his behavior was un-Islamic. On previous episodes, the character said: "You and I are laying the foundation for a world led by Islamists. We will return the Islamic community to its former greatness, and liberate Jerusalem, God willing, liberate Iraq, God willing, and liberate all the countries of the Muslims invaded by the murderers." During Friday's show, the adult presenter and the station manager, al-Sharawi, told viewers that once Islam rules, its message of "good and peace" will also rule. "We don't incite. We present facts," said al-Sharawi. "We can't cut off our children from the reality they live everyday." He said he repeated the words love and peace six times during the show. "We have an educational and entertainment message. It carries knowledge, a sense of humor and morality. There is no shame in this, and we will not go back on it," he said. Hamas loyalists launched the Al Aqsa satellite channel last year. Bearded young men read the news and Islamic music is layered over footage of masked militants firing rockets into Israel. The channel also broadcasts talk shows, programs about the disabled and cartoons. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The legislation, which awaits parliamentary approval, has underscored long-standing tensions in this largely Roman Catholic country between a desire to hold on to church-sanctioned traditions and a push toward greater secularization. Organizers of Saturday's "Family Day" include lay Catholic groups and family associations. While the demonstration has been endorsed by Italian bishops, neither the Vatican nor the Italian bishops' conference is formally behind it. "Family belongs to believers and nonbelievers alike," said Gaetano Quagliariello, a center-right senator who helped organize the rally at Rome's St. John Lateran piazza. "Family has to do with culture and civilization." The bill at the heart of the controversy was passed by Premier Romano Prodi's center-left Cabinet in February, spurring tensions in a coalition that includes both hard-line leftists and Christian Democrats. The proposed legislation stops short of legalizing gay marriage - as was done in Spain and other European countries. Rather, it would entitle unmarried couples who live together to hospital visiting rights, inheritance rights and other legal protections. "This bill is modest and it's just a partial solution," said Franco Grillini, president of the main Italian gay rights group Arcigay. "I think that the problem is that the country is scared of diversity. We need to defend the dignity of our unions, and we want the government to recognize them." He welcomed the rally, however, saying it was a "triumph" for gay rights. "It will be a big protest against us, and that is the best advertisement we could ever have." Critics say the bill would dismantle what they consider to be the centerpiece of society: the traditional family based on marriage between a man and a woman. Supporters argue the bill does not create an alternative family model and say recognizing the basic rights of people who live outside marriage would make Italy a more civilized country. The bill's fate is anything but certain. Prodi has left lawmakers in his divided coalition free to vote according to their consciences when parliament finally takes it up. The bill has irked the Vatican, which under Benedict has been conducting a fierce campaign to protect traditional families. "Family deserves a priority attention, as it is showing signs of collapse under pressure from lobbies that are capable of negatively affecting the legislative processes," the pope said recently. "Only on the rock of marital love between a man and a woman, solid and faithful, can we build a community worthy of a human being." Benedict is visiting Brazil, where he assailed popular culture for promoting sexual immorality and destroying the sanctity of marriage in an address to hundreds of thousands of people Friday. "It is necessary to oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage," he said. The number of official marriages celebrated annually in Italy has declined steadily since the early 1970s, from 404,464 registered in 1972, to 264,026 in 2001 and just over 250,000 in 2005, according to the national statistics bureau, Istat. In their place are an ever increasing number of de-facto unions, which the agency estimated at about 592,000 in 2005, or about 4.1 percent of all heterosexual couples. The agency doesn't keep statistics on the number of gay couples. Tensions over the proposed legislation were heightened last month when graffiti threatening the head of the Italian bishops, Archbishop Angelo Bagnasco of Genoa, were scrawled on buildings in the northern city and a bullet was sent to his office. Bagnasco has spoken out strongly against the proposed legislation. Organizers say the rally should not be colored with political overtones or be seen as an anti-government protest. But it has already proven embarrassing for Prodi's coalition, with at least one minister saying he would take part. Center-left lawmakers have said they would attend a counter-demonstration in Rome's Piazza Navona. Demonstration Web site is at &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

STENNIS (AP) -- From an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, Vice President Dick Cheney warned Iran on Friday the U.S. and its allies will keep it from restricting sea traffic as well as from developing nuclear weapons. "We'll keep the sea lanes open," Cheney said from the hangar deck of the USS John C. Stennis as it steamed about 150 miles from the Iranian coast. Cheney is touring the Middle East asking Arab allies to do more to help Iraq and to curb Iran's growing power in the region. With Iraq in turmoil, both Iran and Saudi Arabia are maneuvering to see who can help fill the leadership vacuum. The vice president made clear the United States' intentions on the rivalry. "We'll stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region," he said. On Saturday, Cheney will make a fence-mending visit to Saudi Arabia. The oil-rich kingdom, long a key American ally in the Middle East, recently has been shunning the U.S.-supported government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, suggesting he is too close to Iran. Roughly a quarter of the world's oil supplies pass through the narrow Straits of Hormuz connecting the Persian Gulf with the open waters of the Arabian Sea. Iran controls the eastern side of the straits. With two U.S. carrier groups now in the region, the vice president declared, "We're sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike. We'll keep the sea lanes open." The carrier was in the Gulf about 20 miles off Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. Cheney is spending time there after a two-day tour of Iraq. Standing in front of five F18 Super Hornet fighters and a huge American flag in the cavernous hangar deck - one flight below the carrier's flight deck - Cheney sounded a hard line both on holding firm in Iraq and confronting Iran if necessary. Just over four years after President Bush stood on another aircraft carrier beneath a "Mission Accomplished" banner and declared an end to major combat, Cheney had a far more subdued message. "We want to complete the mission, get it done right, and return with honor," he told Stennis crew members. Officials said that between 3,500 and 4,000 of the carrier's 5,000 sailors and Marines stood in sweltering heat - hovering over 100 degrees - to hear Cheney speak. "It's not easy to serve in this part of the world. It's a place of tension and many conflicts," said Cheney. "We'll stand with our friends in opposing extremism and strategic threats. We'll disrupt attacks on our own forces," he added. U.S. officials have said that some of the sophisticated roadside bombs used against U.S. troops in Iraq have come from Iran. After returning from the carrier, Cheney had dinner with Emirates Crown Prince Sheik Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. On Saturday, before leaving for Saudi Arabia, Cheney is expected to press Emirates President Sheik Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan to support U.S. efforts in Iraq and to shut down Iranian companies in his country that U.S. officials believe are backing Iran's nuclear development. Some 500,000 Iranians live in the Emirates. Cheney's visit comes just two days before Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is to visit Abu Dhabi. Ahmadinejad wants the Emirates and other Gulf Arab countries to drop their military alliances with Washington and join Iran in regional efforts. The United States has about 40,000 troops on land bases in Gulf countries outside Iraq and about 20,000 sailors and Marines in the region. No Gulf state has yet backed Iran's offer of an alliance. Iran's top nuclear negotiator said Friday that a compromise over its nuclear program was impossible if the West continued to demand Tehran suspend uranium enrichment, Iran's state broadcasting company reported on its Web site. Ali Larijani's comments came a day after the U.S. and France took Iran to task during a conference on nuclear proliferation for defying a U.N. Security Council demand that it freeze enrichment. "If the West again applies the past wordings about Iran's nuclear case, this issue will not conclude," the Web site quoted Larijani as saying. "They should abandon this idea that they can change conditions of Iran's nuclear case by applying harsh word policy." When he goes to Saudi Arabia on Saturday, Cheney faces a difficult diplomatic mission - trying to ease concerns of King Abdullah about the direction of al-Maliki's Shiite-dominated government in Iraq. Abdullah has increasingly sent signals that he doubts the U.S. troop buildup to help secure Baghdad will work. The king refused to see al-Maliki as the Iraqi prime minister was making a tour of Arab countries late last month. And during a regional conference in the Egyptian resort of Sharm el-Sheik in early May, Saudi Arabia's foreign minister was one of the few Arab diplomats al-Maliki did not meet in face-to-face talks. Abdullah's snub to al-Maliki appeared aimed at showing Saudi Arabia's concern that the Iraqi government is too close to Iran and is not doing enough to reconcile with Iraq's Sunni Arab minority, a Saudi official said at the time. Iran, like Iraq, is heavily Shiite. Saudi Arabia has a predominantly Sunni Muslim population. The visit to the Stennis was a return trip for Cheney, who came to the carrier - then in the Arabian Sea - in March 2002 as he was trying to build support in the area for invading Iraq. Cheney flew to and from the carrier Friday by helicopter. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BRITAIN_BLAIR_BROWN?SITE=CAACS&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	Auburn Journal : AP Stories Place a Class Ad Search past 14 days Search for older articles Letters to the Editor Looking Behind the Scenes May 11, 3:09 PM EDT Brown Vows to Learn From Iraq Mistakes Latest News from Britain Iraqi President: U.S. Troops Should Stay Brown Vows to Learn From Iraq Mistakes No Disciplinary Action for London Police Blair Formally Endorses Brown to Be PM Britain to Hand Over Aboriginal Remains Blair Legacy: Reform, Peace, War Buy AP Photo Reprints LONDON (AP) -- Gordon Brown signaled a shift in policy in Iraq and a new vision for Britain as he launched his campaign Friday to become the country's next prime minister. Appearing before a standing ovation of hand-picked supporters only hours after Prime Minister Tony Blair formally endorsed his candidacy, Brown, who has waited more than a decade for his chance to lead the country, strode to the podium and confidently laid out a platform that promised to be both compassionate and tough. "I will listen, and I will learn. I will strive to meet people's aspirations," Brown said, pledging to win back disenchanted voters. "I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place." Brown signaled that as prime minister, he would abandon Blair's presidential style of leadership by restoring Parliament's authority in decisions such as when to go to war. Government must be accountable, he said. "I accept that mistakes have been made," Brown said, without offering specifics. "We will keep our obligations to the Iraqi people. These are obligations that are part of U.N. resolution, they are in support of a democracy. I do think that over the next few months the emphasis will shift." The question is how much Brown will shift Britain's role in the Iraq war, which has divided the country. He indicated he wants to devote more time and resources toward the creation of jobs and basic services for the Iraqi people. "There are too many people in Iraq who don't have a stake in the economic future of the country, too many people unemployed, too many people who are not seeing services developed ... and therefore too many people who don't feel loyalty to the regime," he said. Brown did not outline specifics on his Iraq policy. He said he will make his first trip to Iraq in the coming weeks to inspect the situation. Blair announced in February that his government - the top U.S. ally in the Iraq war - will reduce its troop level by 1,600 to about 5,500 by spring, but will retain a presence in southern Iraq until at least 2008. A total of 148 British soldiers have died since the 2003 invasion. Brown also promised to be strong on defense and security. "And obviously we've got to do more to win the battle of hearts and minds against al-Qaida terrorism," he said. Brown's speech at a converted Edwardian-era school in central London was the first act in his campaign to become Labour Party chief - and as a result, British leader. It also marked Brown's first effort to emerge from the shadow of the telegenic Blair - a challenge for the wonkish Brown, who must show he can connect with voters. The campaign to revamp the Treasury chief's rumpled image hit an immediate snag when the teleprompters he was using obscured his face for the live television audience. He seemed more relaxed shaking hands of the party faithful in later televised appearances. Brown took the London subway, known as the Tube, to the event, impressing at least one Londoner, 20-year-old student Rohini Simbodyal. "We got on the Tube and people were looking at Gordon Brown," Simbodyal said. "People were amazed, saying, 'It's Gordon.' But everyone was very British, they looked and then looked away. A few people came up and shook his hand and said, 'Good luck.'" "He was just like a normal guy," she said. President Bush also praised Brown's forthrightness, describing him as "easy to talk to." But it remains to be seen how close the two men might become. Brown has been more reserved in his comments about Bush, whose alliance with Blair cost the Labour Party votes. Bush and Blair have had a close relationship, speaking regularly by phone and videoconference and getting together for talks at least twice a year since 2003. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Brown was aware of the dangers surrounding failure in Iraq, and she didn't expect U.S.-British relations to change dramatically. "Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we will work very, very well with Gordon Brown when he becomes prime minister," Rice told the British Broadcasting Corp. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/G/GERMANY_SEPT_11_TRIAL?SITE=CAACS&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	Auburn Journal : AP Stories Place a Class Ad Search past 14 days Search for older articles Letters to the Editor Looking Behind the Scenes May 11, 2:35 PM EDT Sept. 11 Suspect Loses Appeal in Germany Sept. 11 Suspect Loses Appeal in Germany Protests in Germany Over Raids Shredded East German Files Reassembled Museum Created for Germans Who Hid Jews Clemency Plea by German Terrorist Fails Buy AP Photo Reprints BERLIN (AP) -- A Moroccan convicted of helping three of the Sept. 11 suicide pilots in their plot lost his final chance to appeal in Germany when the country's top criminal court announced Friday that it had refused to hear his case. Mounir el Motassadeq, 33, was convicted in November of being an accessory to the murder of the 246 passengers and crew on the four jetliners used in the 2001 terrorist attacks in the U.S. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the maximum penalty possible under German law. Germany's Federal Court of Justice said in a short statement Friday that it had decided on May 2 that el Motassadeq's appeal was "unfounded." "Therefore the verdict against the defendant el Motassadeq is legally binding," the court said. It did not provide further details. The decision was the final step in what has been a long trip through the German legal system that began when el Motassadeq was arrested two months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. He has gone through two full trials. Even though all appeals are now exhausted, el Motassadeq's attorney Udo Jacob said he would petition the original Hamburg court to reopen the case, which it is highly unlikely to do. He also said he would take the case to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, arguing that el Motassadeq did not receive a fair trial because of the lack of evidence from al-Qaida suspects in U.S. custody. "He knew nothing of the attack plans, but how can one prove that one didn't know something?" Jacob said. A spokeswoman for the Court of Human Rights, Stephanie Klein, refused to speculate on whether it would hear the case, but said it has taken up cases in the past concerning witness issues. Dominic Puopolo Jr., whose mother died aboard one of the hijacked airliners, said he was pleased with the German court's decision. "It's been a long journey and it's good to know we're getting close to the end," he said, adding he was now moving ahead with a civil suit against the Moroccan. "We're not going to walk away from this - ever," Puopolo said in a telephone interview from Miami Beach, Fla., where he lives. "My mother's dead and she's never coming back and this person's actions changed the lives of thousands of families. It's unacceptable." El Motassadeq was first convicted and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison in 2003, but that verdict was overturned by a federal court the following year, largely because of the lack of testimony from witnesses in U.S. custody. At a retrial in 2005, the U.S. provided limited summaries from the interrogation of, among others, Ramzi Binalshibh, a suspected liaison between the Hamburg hijackers and al-Qaida. The Hamburg court acquitted el Motassadeq of direct involvement in the attacks, but sentenced him to seven years for belonging to a terrorist group. Prosecutors appealed the decision, and in November the Federal Court of Justice ruled that evidence showed el Motassadeq was aware Hamburg-based hijackers Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah planned to hijack and crash planes, even though he might not have known the specifics of the plot. It convicted him of 246 counts of accessory to murder in addition to the membership in a terrorist organization charge. Judge Klaus Tolksdorf ruled then that el Motassadeq had helped "watch the attackers' backs and conceal them" by helping them keep up the appearance of being regular university students - paying tuition and rent fees, and transferring money. Tolksdorf said it was irrelevant to el Motassadeq's guilt whether he knew of the planned timing, dimension or targets of the attacks. In January, Germany's constitutional court refused to hear a separate appeal in which el Motassadeq's attorneys claimed that evidence from other terrorism suspects was not properly considered at his trial. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FRENCH_KIDNAPPED?SITE=OHALL2&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 12, 9:05 AM EDT Kidnapped Aid Worker Returns to France Buy AP Photo Reprints PARIS (AP) -- Looking thin and frail as he stepped from a French military plane, an aid worker released by the Taliban after five weeks in captivity in Afghanistan pleaded Saturday for his captors to free three Afghans seized with him. Eric Damfreville, who had one eye covered by a bandage, was wearing a traditional Afghan outfit and wrapped in a gold emergency blanket as he arrived in his native France. "I feel a great joy to be here this morning," said Damfreville, who works for the humanitarian aid group Terre d'Enfance. "But my joy will be even greater once Azrat, Rasul, Hashim, three Afghans, are also freed." The head of Terre d'Enfance, Antoine Vuillaume, said Damfreville had spent most of his captivity bound and gagged and described his health as "quite deteriorated." He said Damfreville was suffering from dehydration and a stomach ailment, as well as a problem with his left eye. Damfreville said he was treated well by his captors and that his weakened health was a result of the length of his detention and the sparse conditions of the area where he was held. "There was no bad treatment from our captors, who did everything so that the conditions of detention were good," he said. After speaking briefly to reporters, he was put on a stretcher and taken by ambulance to a hospital in the Paris region. "His release is a relief for all of us," said French Foreign Minister Philippe Douste-Blazy said. "He is now going to rest because he needs it." The aid worker was released Friday after 38 days in captivity. He had been abducted along with a female colleague and the three Afghans in the country's southwestern Nimroz province on April 3. The Taliban released the woman, Celine Cordelier, on April 28. There was no word on the fate of the three Afghans. After taking the group captive, the Taliban demanded the withdrawal of all remaining French troops from Afghanistan. France pulled 200 French special forces out of Afghanistan late last year and still has about 1,000 troops stationed in the country. The French aid workers were kidnapped two weeks after Afghan authorities released five Taliban prisoners in exchange for an Italian newspaper reporter who was abducted along with his two Afghan colleagues in southern Helmand province on March 5. The two Afghans were killed. The deal was heavily criticized by the United States and some European nations. Afghan lawmakers and foreigners working in the country said it gave the Taliban incentive to stage more kidnappings, and Afghans were angry that the Italian was released but that the two Afghans were not. The Afghan government has said the prisoner swap was a one-time deal for the Italian journalist, and has ruled out future exchanges. The Taliban credited Damfreville's release to comments by France's President-elect Nicholas Sarkozy that French troops would eventually leave Afghanistan, but French authorities refused to provide any details about the circumstances of his release. Asked whether the former hostage was carrying a message from the Taliban for French officials, Douste-Blazy insisted on the need for strict confidentiality. Le Monde daily, however, said the French government "must have paid" the captors a "hefty sum" for the release of Damfreville and Cordelier. In a televised interview before his election last week, Sarkozy suggested he might withdraw French troops from Afghanistan. "The long-term presence of French troops in that part of the world does not look definitive to me," Sarkozy told France-2 television. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/POPE_BRAZIL?SITE=OHALL2&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 12, 3:15 AM EDT Pope Heads to Brazilian Shrine City Pope Heads to Brazilian Shrine City Pope News Conference Causes Stir Pope to Canonize First Brazilian Saint Pope Visits Brazil, Church Loses Ground Official Says Amazon Dams on Fast Track Pope Heads to Brazilian Shrine City Pope News Conference Causes Stir Wartime Pope Edges Closer to Sainthood Pope Says He Suppports Excommunication Pope to Canonize First Brazilian Saint Pope Benedict's trip to Latin America Buy AP Photo Reprints Justice Delayed: Latin America's Dirty Wars Leaning Left: Political Changes in Latin America Pope Heads to Brazilian Shrine City Surrender Ends Standoff in Costa Rica Haiti Immigrants Angry With Boat Sinking Man Storms Russia's Costa Rica Embassy Cuba Accuses U.S. of Violating Treaties APARECIDA, Brazil (AP) -- Pope Benedict XVI turned his attention to strategies for reversing the Catholic Church's declining influence in Latin America, traveling to Brazil's most important shrine to open a regional bishops' conference. Benedict lamented "difficult times for the church" in Brazil amid "aggressive proselytizing" by born-again Protestant congregations before flying by helicopter from Sao Paulo, the nation's largest city, to Aparecida, a hallowed Catholic religious site. On Saturday, he plans to visit a rural drug treatment center founded by a Franciscan Friar that claims an 80 percent success rate. Addicts receive spiritual guidance while working as beekeepers, milking cows and tending apple orchards. He then will open Sunday's conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops - aimed at finding ways to reverse the erosion of the church in the region and Brazil. Brazil's census shows the percentage of citizens characterizing themselves as Catholics plunged to 74 percent in 2000 from 89 percent in 1980, while those calling themselves evangelical Protestants rose to 15 percent from 7 percent. The backdrop to the conference is Aparecida, 100 miles east of Sao Paulo, which is home to the mammoth Basilica of Aparecida as well as the 3-foot-tall statue of a black Virgin Mary called "Our Lady Who Appeared," the patron saint of Brazil. The statue was pulled from a river in the 18th century by poor fishermen who were not catching any fish, and then caught loads in their nets. Miracles were subsequently attributed to the statue, and so many pilgrims flocked to Aparecida that the church built the basilica and inaugurated it as a shrine in 1955. On Friday, the pope canonized Brazil's first native-born saint in a Mass before about a million people. He held up 18th century Friar Antonio de Sant'Anna Galvao as a model of rectitude and humility "in an age so full of hedonism." Benedict was cheered by flag-waving crowds in the world's largest Catholic nation as he canonized the new saint, continuing a push for saints in the developing world that began under John Paul II, who sought role models as part of the church's worldwide reach. John Paul canonized more saints than all of his predecessors combined. Benedict also called on Catholics to "oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage," picking a tough crowd to confront about hedonism and permissiveness. More than 70 percent of Brazil's 190 million citizens may be Catholics, but sex before marriage is common. Scantily clad actresses are the norm on hugely popular TV soap operas, and women on the beaches wear bikinis that leave little to the imagination. The pope may be popular among Brazilian Catholics but most probably will not heed his call when it comes to sex, said David Gibson, author of "The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World." "This is enormously frustrating to Benedict or any pope; they want to have more impact," Gibson said. But "how do you go against a culture like that? It's tough." While polls show Brazilians oppose expanding access to abortion, they overwhelmingly support using condoms to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases - in firm opposition to church doctrine. The government, in fact, hands out millions of condoms for free every year, especially ahead of the debauchery that is an integral part of Brazil's pre-lent carnival. "Nothing could be more countercultural than his message in Brazil, the land of the thong," said Gibson, a former Vatican Radio reporter. The drug treatment center that Benedict will visit near Aparecida, "Fazenda de Esperanca," or "Farm of Hope," was founded by Franciscan friar Hanz Stapel in 1983. Addicts are given a mixture of spiritual guidance and discipline with hard farm work to help them kick the habit, develop a work ethic and learn to help others with troubled lives. There are now 31 similar farm-treatment centers in Brazil and 10 more in countries such as Russia, Mexico and Mozambique.

He then will open Sunday's conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops - aimed at finding ways to reverse the erosion of the church in the region and Brazil. Brazil's census shows the percentage of citizens characterizing themselves as Catholics plunged to 74 percent in 2000 from 89 percent in 1980, while those calling themselves evangelical Protestants rose to 15 percent from 7 percent. The backdrop to the conference is Aparecida, 100 miles east of Sao Paulo, which is home to the mammoth Basilica of Aparecida as well as the 3-foot-tall statue of a black Virgin Mary called "Our Lady Who Appeared," the patron saint of Brazil. The statue was pulled from a river in the 18th century by poor fishermen who were not catching any fish, and then caught loads in their nets. Miracles were subsequently attributed to the statue, and so many pilgrims flocked to Aparecida that the church built the basilica and inaugurated it as a shrine in 1955. On Friday, the pope canonized Brazil's first native-born saint in a Mass before about a million people. He held up 18th century Friar Antonio de Sant'Anna Galvao as a model of rectitude and humility "in an age so full of hedonism." Benedict was cheered by flag-waving crowds in the world's largest Catholic nation as he canonized the new saint, continuing a push for saints in the developing world that began under John Paul II, who sought role models as part of the church's worldwide reach. John Paul canonized more saints than all of his predecessors combined. Benedict also called on Catholics to "oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage," picking a tough crowd to confront about hedonism and permissiveness. More than 70 percent of Brazil's 190 million citizens may be Catholics, but sex before marriage is common. Scantily clad actresses are the norm on hugely popular TV soap operas, and women on the beaches wear bikinis that leave little to the imagination. The pope may be popular among Brazilian Catholics but most probably will not heed his call when it comes to sex, said David Gibson, author of "The Rule of Benedict: Pope Benedict XVI and His Battle with the Modern World." "This is enormously frustrating to Benedict or any pope; they want to have more impact," Gibson said. But "how do you go against a culture like that? It's tough." While polls show Brazilians oppose expanding access to abortion, they overwhelmingly support using condoms to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases - in firm opposition to church doctrine. The government, in fact, hands out millions of condoms for free every year, especially ahead of the debauchery that is an integral part of Brazil's pre-lent carnival. "Nothing could be more countercultural than his message in Brazil, the land of the thong," said Gibson, a former Vatican Radio reporter. The drug treatment center that Benedict will visit near Aparecida, "Fazenda de Esperanca," or "Farm of Hope," was founded by Franciscan friar Hanz Stapel in 1983. Addicts are given a mixture of spiritual guidance and discipline with hard farm work to help them kick the habit, develop a work ethic and learn to help others with troubled lives. There are now 31 similar farm-treatment centers in Brazil and 10 more in countries such as Russia, Mexico and Mozambique.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SOMALIA?SITE=OHALL2&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 12, 8:33 AM EDT U.N. Official Asks Somalia to Allow Aid By ELIZABETH A. KENNEDY Buy AP Photo Reprints MOGADHISHU, Somalia (AP) -- The United Nations' top humanitarian official made a landmark visit to this battle-scarred capital Saturday, but the trip was disrupted by an explosion that killed four people near the U.N. compound in south Mogadishu. John Holmes, the U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs, is the highest ranking U.N. official to visit Mogadishu in more than a decade. His tour of the city and his meeting with President Abdullahi Yusuf was delayed briefly by the blast near the compound. Holmes said he had come to push the government to allow humanitarian aid to reach its people while it tried to build on the fragile peace in a country ravaged by continuous fighting. "It is their responsibility to look after civilians, to protect civilians and at the very least not to obstruct aid," Holmes said. The trip comes about two weeks after Somalia's government declared victory over a ferocious Islamic insurgency with the crucial help of troops and helicopter gunships from neighboring Ethiopia and U.S. special forces. Aid groups say the fighting killed 1,670 people between March 12 and April 26 and sent up to 400,000 of the city's 2 million residents fleeing, many into squalid camps or makeshift shelters in the bush. When Holmes arrived Saturday morning at the freshly painted blue and white terminal building at Mogadishu airport, armed African Union troops lined the road. As his 10-vehicle convoy of armored land cruisers and pickup trucks drove to the U.N. compound over crumbling roads, women and children waved and yelled from the doorways of buildings battered by fighting and pockmarked with bullet holes. He said it was not likely that they could bring in more African Union peacekeeping troops until the government improved security. After the explosion Saturday morning, Mohamed Dheere, a former warlord who is now mayor of Mogadishu, arrived at the U.N. compound and said he had come to assess the security situation. "Security is a big challenge," said Dheere. "There is no economy, no finances, police don't have a salary, there is no equipment for police, we are starting from scratch. We are very much sorry about what happened (the explosion), but there is no groundwork for peace." The capital has been mostly calm recently and many of those who fled the violence are starting to return. The government, however, has declared victory before only to have the insurgents reappear weeks later. The insurgents are linked to the Council of Islamic Courts, which had ruled Mogadishu and much of southern Somalia for six quiet months last year. The U.S. has accused the group of links to al-Qaida, which it has consistently denied. Holmes, who was appointed in January to replace Jan Egeland, is the highest-ranking U.N. official to visit Mogadishu since the undersecretary-general went in 1993.

Secretary Michael Chertoff also was expected to discuss changes to the U.S. visa-waiver program during the meeting with security officials from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Poland. A deal on the airline data must be reached by July to avoid problems for both airlines and U.S.-bound passengers.

The two sides disagree on how long U.S. authorities can use data, when it should be destroyed and which agencies should have access to the information. The United States also wants the authority to pull data directly from airline computers, but European countries insist airlines must transmit the information. Chertoff travels to Brussels, Belgium, on Monday where he will address the EU Parliament. Citizens from 15 of the 27 EU nations can enter the United States without applying for a travel visa. U.S. officials say Greece and most of the newer EU members still fail to meet criteria for joining the visa-waiver program. The EU allows Americans to travel to all its member countries without visas and has long insisted on full reciprocity. Poland is especially adamant, arguing that it should be admitted in recognition of its contributions to U.S. operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. The United States rejects 22 percent of Polish visa applicants - a rate that far exceeds the 3 percent benchmark required for entry into the waiver program. Legislation pending in the Congress would allow the program to admit new countries, while requiring all participating countries to impose closer scrutiny of their passports to ensure they are not lost, stolen or easily counterfeited.

Adm. Timothy Keating said he met with Gen. Guo Boxiong, China's top general, and Assistant Foreign Minister He Yafei in discussions aimed at "developing and reinforcing" friendships. Keating said he and Guo exchanged views on Beijing's anti-satellite test in January, when a missile was used to destroy one of its own old weather satellites in low-Earth polar orbit. It was the first time China had successfully tested an anti-satellite system. "An anti-satellite test is not necessarily a clear indication of a desire for peaceful utilization of space," Keating told reporters at a briefing. "It is a confusing signal shall we say for a country who desires, in China's words, a peaceful rise." He said Guo characterized the test as "scientific in nature" and hailed it a success. Keating said the U.S. was watching as China developed its capabilities across the spectrum of military operations, which have significantly improved over the past 20 years. "They're getting better," he said. "That is of obvious interest to us and to everyone in the world." China's People's Liberation Army, the world's largest, has been spending heavily on adding submarines, jet fighters and other high-tech weapons to its arsenal, causing unease among its neighbors. Its reported 2006 budget is $35.3 billion, but analysts believe the true figure is several times higher. One of the apparent goals is building up China's ability to back up threats to attack Taiwan, the self-ruled neighboring island that the Communist Beijing government claims as its own territory. The two sides split during civil war in 1949 and China has threatened war if Taiwan takes steps toward formal independence. Keating said he reiterated Washington's adherence to the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 to Chinese officials. The act requires the United States to maintain sufficient force in the Pacific as a deterrent but does not require the defense of Taiwan by U.S. force if it comes under attack from China. The power to declare war rests with Congress. Keating, who took up his position in March, said there were no immediate plans for joint exercises this year but that he hopes to continue to expand cooperation in that field. Visits between the Chinese and American militaries dropped off after the collision of a U.S. spy plane with a Chinese fighter jet off China's coast in 2001. But relations have improved recently. Last September, two Chinese navy ships stopped in Pearl Harbor in Hawaii - the first visits to a U.S. state in six years. After Pearl Harbor, the ships went to San Diego for the first part of a search-and-rescue exercise that ended in November off the Chinese island province of Hainan. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

Commission on Sustainable Development despite protests from the U.S., European nations and human rights organizations. Africa nominated Francis Nhema, Zimbabwe's minister of environment and tourism, for the post, and the 53-member commission approved that recommendation Friday in a vote of 26-21 with three abstentions, said Luiz Alberto Figueiredo Machado, the commission's vice chair. The post rotates every year among regions of the world and it was Africa's turn to sit in the chair. "We're very disappointed in the election of Zimbabwe as chair," said the U.S. representative to the commission Dan Reifsnyder, deputy assistant secretary for environment and science at the State Department. "We really think it calls into question the credibility of this organization to have a representative from a country that has decimated its agriculture, that used to be the breadbasket of Africa and can't now feed itself," Reifsnyder said. Zimbabwe is suffering its worst economic crisis since independence in 1980, with acute shortages of food, hard currency, gasoline, medicines and most other basic goods. Official inflation is running at about 2,200 percent annually, the highest in the world. President Robert Mugabe, an 83-year-old who has ruled Zimbabwe since it gained independence from Britain in 1980, has been widely criticized for mismanaging the economy. In 2000, Mugabe's government began violently seizing thousands of white-owned commercial farms as part of a program to redistribute land to poor blacks. The chaotic way the seizures were carried out disrupted the agriculture-based economy in Zimbabwe, a former regional breadbasket. Drought, government corruption and repressive policies have compounded the problems. The newly elected chairman dismissed questions Friday night about his country's international standing and the appropriateness of Zimbabwe holding such a position in a global body. "I think it's not time to point fingers," Nhema said. "There is never a perfect method, it's always a method which is appropriate to each country. So it's important not only to look at Zimbabwe but to look at each other and see what we can learn." Several European nations have also called Zimbabwe's candidacy inappropriate. On Friday, the Pan African Parliament, a body of the African Union, voted to send a mission to Zimbabwe to investigate alleged human rights abuses "relating to the arrests and detention, assault and murder of political activists and members of the media." "Zimbabwe is hardly a model of good governance or sustainable development or even responsible leadership," said Benjamin Chang, deputy spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, said before the vote. "Our concern is that it's potential chairmanship would undermine the commission's credibility." Jennifer Windsor, executive director of the human rights group Freedom House, said before the vote that it was "preposterous" for Zimbabwe to lead any U.N. body. Freedom House is independent non-governmental organization that has monitored political rights and civil liberties in Zimbabwe since 1980. She said Mugabe's government "clearly has nothing but scorn for the U.N.'s founding principles of human rights, security and international law." The Commission on Sustainable Development was established by the General Assembly in December 1992 to ensure effective follow-up of the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in June that year, and implementation of key environmental and development agreements. The commission meets annually in New York, and its current session that opened Wednesday is focusing on energy for sustainable development, industrial development, air pollution and climate change. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

Abdul-Aziz al-Hakim did not give more details of the proposed pact. In the past he has repeatedly complained that the U.S. military's lead in the fight against Sunni insurgents hampered the work of Iraq's Shiite-dominated security forces, which he contended were better qualified to fight the insurgents given their knowledge of the terrain and language. "We are working toward reaching a security agreement to define the authority of each side," al-Hakim told a news conference after a two-day meeting of his party, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. Al-Hakim also announced the party's name will be changed to the "Supreme Islamic Council of Iraq" - dropping the word "revolution" to reflect the new political realities in the country. Al-Hakim's comments coincided with an ongoing campaign by lawmakers loyal to anti-American Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr to get parliament to adopt legislation demanding a timetable for the withdrawal of the U.S.-led troops in Iraq and a freeze on the number of foreign forces already in the country. Officials said this week the proposed legislation has been signed by 144 members of the 275-member house, but it is not likely to retain the support of all of them if it is put to a vote. However, that more than half the house signed on the draft is a reflection of the growing impatience of many Iraqis with the continued presence of foreign troops in their country and the failure to end a four-year-old Sunni insurgency and an enduring campaign of terror by al-Qaida. Addressing the same news conference, senior al-Hakim aide Hummam Hamoudi sought to play down the significance of a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces, saying it was more important to reach a timetable for the training and equipping of Iraqi troops. Al-Hakim's party - a senior partner in the coalition government of Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki that has been in office since May last year - was founded in Iran in 1982 with the assistance of Tehran's ruling clergy to fight Saddam Hussein's regime, toppled by the 2003 U.S.-led invasion. In theory, the party's Badr Brigade militia has been disbanded and turned into a political organization, but its former militiamen are known to have infiltrated the security forces. Al-Hakim said his party remained committed to the creation of a semiautonomous region in Iraq's mainly Shiite south, but stressed that such a move hinged on popular support. A federal Iraq is a key plank of the party's ideology, but politicians from the once-dominant Sunni Arab minority insist that federalism would eventually lead to the breakup of the country. Federalism was enshrined in a new constitution adopted in 2005. "We are working for the creation of a region in the center and south ... under the mechanisms provided by in the constitution and with the approval of the people," he said. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.
