The U.S. military announced earlier Friday that it had conducted a series of raids against car bombing networks across the country, killing four suspected insurgents and detaining nine. U.S.-led forces have focused on disrupting car bomb making factories after several high-profile attacks that have killed hundreds in Baghdad and surrounding areas in recent weeks. Officials say al-Qaida-linked Sunni insurgents were trying to provoke retaliatory violence from mainly Shiite militias that had agreed to lay low to avoid confrontations with Americans during a 12-week-old security crackdown. The twin attacks began about 6 p.m. when the driver of a sedan waiting in a line of cars outside a police checkpoint near the old Diyala Bridge blew up his vehicle, partially collapsing the span, police said. About two minutes later, the driver of a large fuel truck barreled toward a second checkpoint at the nearby new Diyala Bridge and blew up his vehicle, police said. The bridge was also damaged, and firefighters worked to extinguish burning cars that had been driving across during the attack. Khalid Ahmed, a local resident who was waiting to cross the bridge during the first attack, was wounded in his shoulder and hand. "I was four cars behind the car bomb that exploded and caught fire. I fainted and I opened my eyes in the hospital," he said. The bombings at the bridges, which cross the Diyala River, a Tigris tributary, killed 12 people, including six police officers, and wounded 21 others, including nine officers, police said. Baghdad's bridges repeatedly have been targeted by bombers. The most serious attack occurred April 12 when a suicide truck bomb collapsed the steel-girder Sarafiyah bridge, plunging cars into the water and killing 11 people. Two days later, a suicide car bomb killed 10 people at the Jadriyah bridge. The blasts Friday occurred despite a series of measures aimed at reducing violence in the capital. U.S. and security forces have increased the checkpoints in the capital and banned large trucks from crossing without strict searches. They also have long imposed a four-hour weekly driving ban during Friday prayers in Baghdad, but that ban ended on schedule three hours before the attacks. The U.S. commander in northern Iraq, Maj. Gen. Benjamin R. Mixon, meanwhile, said he did not have enough troops for the mission in Diyala, a province northeast of Baghdad that has seen a rise in violence blamed largely on militants who fled the Baghdad security operation. Mixon also said Iraqi government officials are not moving fast enough to provide the "most powerful weapon" against insurgents - a government that works and supplies services for the people. Mixon has already received extra troops and has increased attacks on militants, but he has asked Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, the No. 2 commander in Iraq, for more. "I laid out a plan for General Odierno on the numbers of forces that I would need," Mixon told Pentagon reporters by video conference from Iraq. "We have made progress ... we have taken terrain back from the enemy. General Odierno intends to give me additional forces as they become available." Facing growing opposition to the war among Americans, Iraqi President Jalal Talabani also said U.S. and British troops would need to stay in Iraq for one or two more years to help stem surging violence. "I think that in one or two years we will be able to recruit our forces, to prepare our forces and say goodbye to our friends," Talabani said in a speech to students at Cambridge University. In one raid early Friday, troops acting on intelligence obtained in previous operations approached a building near Taji, an air base 12 miles north of Baghdad, suspected of housing a car bombing cell responsible for attacks on Iraqi civilians and U.S.-led forces, the military said. The troops came under fire from four armed men, whom they killed in a gunbattle, the military said. One of those killed was suspected of being a leader of the cell with ties to al-Qaida in Iraq's top leaders, the military said. U.S. forces have staged several raids in the area in recent weeks aimed at the terror network's leadership, including one in which they killed al-Qaida propagandist Muharib Abdul-Latif al-Jubouri earlier this month. Forces also carried out raids in Baghdad and the northern city of Mosul on Thursday and Friday, detaining a total of nine people suspected of producing bombs and smuggling foreign fighters into the country to carry out attacks against U.S. troops, the military said. Two U.S. soldiers were killed in separate bombing attacks, the military announced Friday. One soldier from the Multinational Division-North was killed Thursday in an explosion in Diyala province, northeast of Baghdad, the military said. The second soldier was killed in eastern Baghdad when a bomb exploded near his patrol, the military said. The deaths raised to at least 3,385, the members of the U.S. military who have died since the Iraq war started in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AFGHAN_VIOLENCE?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 10:26 AM EDT U.S. Confirms Afghan Civilian Casualties Landmine Education Becoming a Priority in Afghanistan A Children's Oasis in Kabul Rebirth of Afghan Art Kabul: Five Years After the Taliban's Fall Taliban Free Abducted French Aid Worker U.S. Confirms Afghan Civilian Casualties Pakistan Fences Part of Afghan Border Afghan Bill Calls for Talks With Taliban Report: Afghan Who Shot Soldiers Was Ill Buy AP Photo Reprints KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- The U.S.-led coalition confirmed that a battle between U.S. forces and Taliban militants in southern Afghanistan caused civilian casualties, killing at least one child, and said a joint Afghan-U.S. investigation is under way. A Taliban spokesman said meanwhile the group had released a French aid worker kidnapped in southern Afghanistan two months ago. New airstrikes in the same area on Thursday killed 10 Taliban fighters after the insurgents ambushed a patrol, Eizatullah Khan, the Sangin district chief, said Friday. The governor of Helmand province has said 21 civilians were killed in airstrikes Tuesday in the Sangin area of Helmand province, though residents of the area said the civilian death toll was higher. In a statement late Thursday, the coalition said it had treated 20 Afghan civilians wounded in the 16-hour battle, including a child who later died. "There are confirmed reports of civilian casualties," but it was unclear how many, the statement said. "A joint Afghan and coalition force inquiry is being conducted." Gen. Dan McNeill, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, told NPR News' "Morning Edition" that "it does appear there were civilian casualties" but that it wasn't clear what caused them. He said it was likely the Taliban militants had been firing on coalition forces from civilian homes. U.S. Special Forces "got into an ambush by a far superior force, and as they tried to work their way through this by shooting and moving, it became clear this was a pretty good size insurgent force who also could shoot and move pretty well," McNeill told NPR in an interview being aired Friday. "And eventually the only way they were going (to) get out of it is - they got backed up to a river and between that and a piece of high ground - was to use airstrikes. It did not dissuade the insurgents." Haji Pir Mohammad, who lives in the village where the battle Tuesday took place, said Friday that 37 people were killed after aircraft bombed four civilian homes - including 12 members of a single family. Another villager, Mohammad Asif, said earlier this week that 38 civilians died in the airstrikes. Helmand Gov. Assadullah Wafa has said that 21 civilians were killed. "There are always people who will say that 40 or 60 people were killed, but the civilian toll appears to be around 20," said Khan. Wafa has said Taliban militants sought shelter in civilian homes during the fight between U.S. Special forces and Taliban fighters, but Pir Mohammad said no fighters were in the village and American and Afghan troops had left an hour before it was bombed. Death tolls in remote battle sites in Afghanistan are nearly impossible to verify. The battle in Sangin marked the third major incident resulting in civilian deaths in the last several months, sparking outrage among Afghans and a warning from President Hamid Karzai that civilian deaths can no longer be tolerated. In March, U.S. Marines Special Forces fired on civilians after a suicide attack in eastern Afghanistan, killing 19 civilians and wounding 50. Late last month airstrikes and fighting killed some 50 civilians in the western province of Herat, Afghan and U.N. officials say. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/UN_ZIMBABWE?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 11:48 AM EDT Zimbabwe Likely to Head Key U.N. Body By EDITH M. LEDERER Zimbabwe Likely to Head Key U.N. Body Zimbabwe Lawyer Decries Intimidation Police Assault Attorneys in Zimbabwe Correction: Corn Prices in Zimbabwe Zimbabwe's Mugabe Warns Catholic Bishops Buy AP Photo Reprints UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Zimbabwe is likely to win approval to head a key U.N. body charged with promoting economic progress and environmental protection despite protests from some Western countries and human rights organizations. The 53-member Commission on Sustainable Development is scheduled to vote Friday on its new chair, U.N. officials said. The chair traditionally rotates among regions of the world, and it is Africa's choice this year. The continent has chosen Zimbabwe as its candidate, and the government has nominated Francis Nhema, the minister of environment and tourism for the post. "For Zimbabwe to lead any U.N. body is preposterous," said Jennifer Windsor, executive director of Freedom House, an independent nongovernmental organization that has monitored political rights and civil liberties in Zimbabwe since 1980. She said President Robert Mugabe's government "clearly has nothing but scorn for the U.N.'s founding principles of human rights, security and international law." Freedom House called on other members of the commission to block Zimbabwe's selection, but that appeared unlikely because of widespread support for the rotation system. Several European nations have called Zimbabwe's candidacy inappropriate, and the United States said Zimbabwe would not be an effective leader of the commission. "Zimbabwe is hardly a model of good governance or sustainable development or even responsible leadership," said Benjamin Chang, deputy spokesman for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. "Our concern is that it's potential chairmanship would undermine the commission's credibility," he said. "The commission is to address themes such as sustainable agriculture and rural development at a time when Zimbabwe's government has turned the country from the breadbasket of southern African to the country with the highest rate of inflation and a decimated agriculture sector." The commission was established by the General Assembly in December 1992 to ensure effective follow-up of the Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in June that year and implementation of key environmental and development agreements. The commission meets annually in New York, and its current session that opened Wednesday is focusing on energy for sustainable development, industrial development, air pollution and climate change. Mugabe, an 83-year-old former anti-colonial rebel who has ruled Zimbabwe since it gained independence from Britain in 1980, has acknowledged that police used violent methods against opposition supporters and killed at least one activist. He has warned alleged perpetrators of unrest that they would be "bashed" again if violence continued. Zimbabwe's ruling party has endorsed Mugabe as its candidate in next year's presidential election. Victory would allow him to stay in power until 2013, when he would be nearly 90. On Friday, the Pan African Parliament, a body of the African Union, voted to send a mission to Zimbabwe to investigate alleged human rights abuses "relating to the arrests and detention, assault and murder of political activists and members of the media."

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BRITAIN_BLAIR_BROWN?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 11:38 AM EDT Britain's Brown Vows to Learn From Iraq Latest News from Britain Britain's Brown Vows to Learn From Iraq No Disciplinary Action for London Police Blair Formally Endorses Brown to Be PM Britain to Hand Over Aboriginal Remains Blair Legacy: Reform, Peace, War Britain's Blair in His Own Words Buy AP Photo Reprints LONDON (AP) -- Gordon Brown launched his campaign to become Britain's next prime minister on Friday, pledging to learn from the mistakes of the Iraq war while honoring "our obligations to the Iraqi people." Brown, who faces no serious opposition after waiting more than a decade for his chance to lead the country, said there needed to be a stronger emphasis on political reconciliation and economic development in Iraq. "And obviously we've got to more to win the battle of hearts and minds against al-Qaida terrorism." Prime Minister Tony Blair, who announced he would resign June 27, officially endorsed Brown on Friday. As Treasury chief, Brown is credited with much of Britain's recent economic boom. "I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place," Brown said, pledging to win back voters disenchanted after a decade of Labour Party rule. The question is how much Brown will shift Britain's role in the Iraq war, which has divided Britain. He has indicated he wants Britain to devote more time and resources toward the creation of jobs and basic services for the Iraqi people, as the country slowly draws down its troops. Blair announced in February that his government - the top U.S. ally in the Iraq war - will reduce its troop level by 1,600 to about 5,500 by spring, but will retain a presence in southern Iraq until at least 2008. A total of 148 British soldiers have died since the 2003 invasion. But Brown has not mentioned specifics on his Iraq policy. He said he will make his first trip to Iraq in the coming weeks to inspect the situation firsthand. "I accept that mistakes have been made," Brown said. "We will keep our obligations to the Iraqi people. These are obligations that are part of U.N. resolution, they are in support of a democracy. I do think that over the next few months the emphasis will shift." "There are too many people in Iraq who don't have a stake in the economic future of the country, too many people unemployed, too many people who are not seeing services developed ... and therefore too many people who don't feel loyalty to the regime," he said. It also remains to be seen how close Brown and President Bush will be. Bush has called Brown a thinker and easy to talk to. Brown has been more reserved in his comments about the American president, whose alliance with Blair lost the Labour Party votes. Bush and Blair have had a close relationship, speaking regularly by phone and videoconference and getting together for talks at least twice a year since 2003. The White House announced Friday that Blair will visit Washington next week to meet with Bush. The two leaders will also will see each other in early June at the annual summit of industrialized nations, being held in Germany. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said Brown was aware of the dangers surrounding failure in Iraq, and she didn't expect U.S.-Britain relations to change dramatically. "The bonds with Prime Minister Blair have been forged through some of the most difficult times, through the time of 9/11, through the time of the attacks on London, through Afghanistan and Iraq and Northern Ireland, and those are bonds of friendship that come from having been through some of the toughest circumstances," Rice told the British Broadcasting Corp. "But Britain and America will always be friends and I know that we will work very, very well with Gordon Brown when he becomes prime minister." Jack Straw, Britain's former foreign secretary, said Brown would respect the alliance with the United States. "Gordon Brown's affection and understanding of America goes back decades. And he takes the same view as Tony Blair does, which is that Britain's security fundamentally depends on the alliance with the United States and the union with Europe." The Iraq war severely dented Labor's popularity. Blair's close alliance with Bush was unpopular at home, there were mass marches in Britain opposing the U.S.-led invasion before it began, and the government's claims that Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of weapons of mass destruction proved false. For more than a year, Labour has consistently trailed in opinion polls behind a Conservative Party revived by its new leader, David Cameron. In local and regional elections earlier this month, Labour lost hundreds of seats in city and county councils, and was beaten into second place in the Scottish Parliament elections by the Scottish National Party, which advocates independence. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

Korea Iran, U.S. Court Gulf Arab Allies Denmark: Iran Would Compensate Attack Iranian-American Being Held in Prison Iranian Fighter Jet Crash Kills 1 Ahmadinejad's Letter to President Bush Buy AP Photo Reprints TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's foreign minister said North Korea's debts stand in the way of improving ties between the two countries - both U.S. foes under international pressure over their nuclear programs. It was the first time an official of either country referred to their dealings, which go back to at least the 1980s but are not publicly known. The extent of North Korea's debts to Iran remain unknown. North Korea's "debts to Tehran are among the obstacles in the way of cooperation," the official IRNA news agency quoted Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki as saying Friday. "The two countries can find a formula to remove this obstacle." Mottaki met late Thursday with North Korean acting Foreign Minister Kim Yong Il. He added that Iran was still interested in improving ties with North Korea "in the fields of politics, economics and culture" with North Korea. Kim said his country was ready to cooperate with Iran "in various economic fields" and support the country on the international level. On Friday, Vice President Dick Cheney issued a warning to Iran while aboard an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, saying the United States would join allies "to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region." The U.N. Security Council has imposed two sets of sanctions against Iran for its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment, a process that can produce fuel for nuclear reactors or the material for atomic bombs. Iran, which denies it is secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, has another deadline later this month to freeze enrichment or face tighter sanctions. The Security Council imposed sanctions on North Korea last year for conducting its first nuclear weapons test. North Korea has since refused to act on a February pledge to start dismantling its nuclear program in exchange for economic aid and political concessions. The North Korean government is believed to have cooperated with Iran militarily since early 1980s, when Saddam Hussein waged an eight-year war against Iran.

Caivano Pope Canonizes First Brazilian Saint Pope News Conference Causes Stir Pope to Canonize First Brazilian Saint Pope Visits Brazil, Church Loses Ground Official Says Amazon Dams on Fast Track Pope Canonizes First Brazilian Saint Pope News Conference Causes Stir Wartime Pope Edges Closer to Sainthood Pope Says He Suppports Excommunication Pope to Canonize First Brazilian Saint Pope Benedict's trip to Latin America Buy AP Photo Reprints Justice Delayed: Latin America's Dirty Wars Leaning Left: Political Changes in Latin America Pope Canonizes First Brazilian Saint Cuba Accuses U.S. of Violating Treaties Cuba Frees Journalist After 22 Months Haiti Migrants Angry by Alleged Ramming U.S. Probes 1997 Cuba Hotel Bombings SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Pope Benedict XVI canonized an 18th-century monk - a friar who handed out tiny rice-paper pills inscribed with a prayer - as Brazil's first native-born saint Friday, as hundreds of thousands cheered and waved flags from all corners of South America. Holding up Friar Antonio de Sant'Anna Galvao as a model of rectitude and humility "in an age so full of hedonism," Benedict said the world needs clear souls and pure minds, adding: "It is necessary to oppose those elements of the media that ridicule the sanctity of marriage and virginity before marriage." It was a message that reflected Benedict's uneasiness with the effects of popular culture on young people. He has warned that some video games and animated films promote violence and trivialize sexuality. Seated on a throne of Brazilian hardwood and surrounded by Latin American bishops and choirs of hundreds, Benedict pronounced the sainthood of Galvao, the Franciscan monk who is credited by the church with 5,000 miracle cures. The canonization makes Galvao the first native-born saint from the world's largest Roman Catholic country, home to more than 120 million of the planet's 1.1 billion Catholics. "Do you realize how big this is?" asked Herminia Fernandes, who joined the multitude that jammed an airfield for the open-air Mass. "It's huge, this pope is visiting Brazil for the first time and at the same time he is giving us a saint. It's a blessing." Friar Galvao is the tenth saint Benedict has canonized, and the first such ceremony held outside Rome. It continues a push for saints in Latin America and elsewhere in the developing world that began under John Paul II, who sought role models as part of the church's worldwide reach. John Paul canonized more saints than all of his predecessors combined. Galvao, who died in 1822, began a tradition among Brazilian Catholics of handing out tiny rice-paper pills, inscribed with a Latin prayer, to people seeking cures for everything from cancer to kidney stones. Although doctors and even some Catholic clergy dismiss the pills as placebos or superstitious fakery, cloistered nuns still toil in the Sao Paulo monastery where Galvao is buried, preparing thousands of the Tic Tac-sized pills for free daily distribution. Each one carries these words: "After birth, the Virgin remained intact. Mother of God, intercede on our behalf." After canonizing Galvao, the pope hugged Sandra Grossi de Almeida, 37, and her son Enzo, 7. She is one of two Brazilian women certified by the Vatican as divinely inspired miracles justifying the sainthood. She had a uterine malformation that should have made it impossible for her to carry a child for more than four months, but after taking the pills, she gave birth to Enzo. "I have faith," Grossi recently told The Associated Press. "I believe in God, and the proof is right here." Benedict's trip has so far focused on reinforcing church doctrine on abortion, sexual morality and euthanasia. At a rally Thursday night, he instructed young Catholics to avoid premarital sex, remain faithful once they are married and to promote life from "its beginning to natural end." The latter was - at least in part - a reference to abortion, the issue that has dominated Benedict's first visit to Latin America since he became pope two years ago. And while Benedict made no mention Thursday of the church's battle against Brazil's free distribution of condoms to combat AIDS, he called for fidelity between spouses and chastity "both within and outside marriage" - church language for responsible sex. "Seek to resist forcefully the snares of evil that are found in many contexts," he told the young Catholics, who cheered loudly when he mentioned his predecessor, the late Pope John Paul II, who visited Brazil three times. They also shouted, "I love you," when Benedict finished talking. The pope also warned against drug use, violence, corruption and the temptations of wealth and power - themes sure to resonate across the region. Earlier this year, Benedict declared that "any trend to produce programs and products - including animated films and video games - which in the name of entertainment exalt violence and portray anti-social behavior or the trivialization of human sexuality is a perversion." His condemnation Thursday of the "devastation of the environment of the Amazon Basin" was particularly important in Brazil, where Catholic activists have been working with the landless - at times at odds with the Vatican. The pope heads Friday evening to the shrine city of Aparecida, about 100 miles from Sao Paulo, where he will visit a drug treatment center Saturday and open a conference of Latin American and Caribbean bishops on Sunday. Aparecida is the most important Catholic religious site in Brazil, home to the mammoth Basilica of Aparecida and the three-foot tall statue of a black Virgin Mary called "Our Lady Who Appeared," the patron saint of Brazil. The statue was pulled from a river in the 18th century by poor fishermen who were not catching any fish, and then caught loads in their nets. Miracles were subsequently attributed to the statue, and so many pilgrims flocked to Aparecida that the church built the basilica and inaugurated it as a shrine in 1955.

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/J/JAPAN_BREAST_FEEDING?SITE=WWL&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	May 11, 12:16 PM EDT Japan Scraps Plan to Urge Breast-Feeding Japan Scraps Plan to Urge Breast-Feeding Japan Has Drop Box for Unwanted Babies Report: Japan Moves Toward Resuming Aid Offices of Cult Splinter Group Raided Japan Rules Against War Claims Buy AP Photo Reprints TOKYO (AP) -- A Japanese proposal to urge mothers to breast-feed their babies and sing lullabies to children was scrapped after critics warned it was too intrusive, a news report said. The proposal, which would also have recommended parents limit their children's television viewing and promote age-appropriate morals, was to have been announced Friday by an education reform panel named by the government. But experts and some government officials said the measure was "beyond intrusive," and interfered in people's private lives, Kyodo News agency said Thursday, citing unnamed individuals close to the panel. Japanese breastfeeding rates are much lower than those in other developed countries, according to various studies cited in a 2006 article in the International Breastfeeding Journal. The comparitive studies said in 2000 the full breastfeeding rate in Japan for infants aged 1 to 2 months was 44.8 percent compared to the U.S. rate of 54.7 percent at 1 month and and Sweden at 80.2 percent at 2 months. Another study of infants aged 3 to 6 months in Nishinomiya City, Japan, found that 43.8 percent of infants were fed breast milk only. These breast-feeding rates still remain lower than the U.S with 47 percent breastfed at 3 months. Education reform has been a key party of conservative Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's agenda since he took office in September. In December, Parliament passed a reform measure that called on schools to "to cultivate an attitude that respects tradition and culture, that loves the nation and home country." The legislation reflected concerns voiced by Abe that Japan's long stretch of economic prosperity has eroded the morals and cooperative spirit of prewar Japanese. Concerns have also been rife about Japan's falling birth rate. Earlier this month, the government said that Japan's child population has fallen to a record low since the end of World War II. To encourage more couples to have children, Abe's government has adopted plans for increasing child care, promoting gender equality and encouraging companies to allow staff more time for family responsibilities. But many opt to have few or no children because of the high cost of raising them and the persisting social expectations for women to quit their jobs after giving birth. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

Korea Chances Slim for Return of USS Pueblo N. Korea Wants U.S. Bank to Handle Funds SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North and South Korea adopted a military agreement Friday enabling the first train crossing of their heavily armed border in more than half a century, the South's Defense Ministry said. The rail test, planned for Thursday, would be the first time trains have crossed the tightly sealed border since inter-Korean rail links were severed in the middle of the 1950-53 Korean War. Two tracks have been reconnected as part of a series of reconciliation projects launched since the two sides held the first-ever summit of their leaders in 2000. The test would be just a single run of trains along the restored tracks on each side of the peninsula, with regular train service between the two sides unlikely to begin anytime soon. The two Koreas had agreed in principle on security for the rail test earlier this week, but the adoption of a formal agreement came only after more than 30 hours of extended talks that stretched into Friday due to unspecified sticking points. South Korea hopes the inter-Korean railways could ultimately be linked to Russia's Trans-Siberian railroad, and could allow an overland route connecting the peninsula to Europe - significantly cutting delivery times for freight that now requires sea transport. Economic officials from both sides agreed last month to conduct the train run, but North Korea's military had the final say on whether it goes forward because such a border crossing requires security arrangements. The security accord sets out protocols for the train crossings next week, including what areas of the border should open and for how long, as well as pledges from each side to guarantee travelers' safety. South Korea had hoped to expand the agreement to cover similar future border crossings, but the North refused. The two sides also agreed in principle to set up a joint fishing area around their disputed western sea border and continue talks on that issue and other measures aimed at preventing accidental clashes in the area, according to a joint statement summarizing the negotiations' outcome. North Korea doesn't recognize the current sea border demarcated by the United Nations at the end of the 1950-53 Korean War, and has long claimed it should be further south. The waters around the border are rich fishing grounds and boats from the two Koreas routinely jostle for position during the May-June crab-catching season. In 1999 and 2002, their navies fought deadly skirmishes, killing several sailors and sinking six ships. The two sides agreed to hold the next general-level talks in July and continue discussions to set up a defense ministers' meeting, the joint statement said. This week's talks were the first high-level military contacts between the two sides in a year. The two Koreas remain technically at war because the Korean War ended in a cease-fire that has never been replaced with a peace treaty. Ties between the two sides have warmed significantly since the 2000 summit, although they suffered during the international standoff over North Korea's nuclear ambitions. Pyongyang conducted its first-ever nuclear test in October, chilling relations with the South. But the South began reaching out again to the North after Pyongyang agreed in February to shut down its nuclear reactor under an agreement with the United States and four other neighboring countries. Still, the communist regime missed an April deadline to close the reactor because of a separate financial dispute with the United States, and it is unclear when it will close down the facility. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the maximum penalty possible under German law, and the Federal Court of Justice said it found el Motassadeq's appeal to be "unfounded" in a May 2 decision. Germany's constitutional court in January had already refused to hear a separate appeal in which el Motassadeq's attorneys claimed that evidence from other terrorism suspects was not properly considered at his trial. The decision Friday was a final step in what has been a long trip through the German legal system that began when el Motassadeq was arrested two months after the Sept. 11 attacks and has featured two full trials. El Motassadeq's attorney Udo Jacob has said in the past that once he had exhausted appeals in Germany he would consider taking the case to the European Court for Human Rights. El Motassadeq was first convicted and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison in 2003, but that verdict was overturned by a federal court the following year - largely because of lack of evidence from al-Qaida suspects in U.S. custody. At a retrial in 2005, the U.S. provided limited summaries from the interrogation of, among others, Ramzi Binalshibh, a suspected liaison between the Hamburg hijackers and al-Qaida. The Hamburg court acquitted el Motassadeq of direct involvement in the attacks, but sentenced him to seven years for belonging to a terrorist group. Prosecutors appealed the decision, and in November the Federal Court of Justice ruled that evidence showed el Motassadeq was aware Hamburg-based hijackers Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah planned to hijack and crash planes, even though he might not have known the specifics of the plot. It convicted him of 246 counts of accessory to murder in addition to the membership in a terrorist organization charge. Judge Klaus Tolksdorf ruled then that el Motassadeq had helped "watch the attackers' backs and conceal them" by doing things such as helping them keep up the appearance of being regular university students - paying tuition and rent fees, and transferring money. Tolksdorf said it was irrelevant to el Motassadeq's guilt whether he knew of the planned timing, dimension or targets of the attacks. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
