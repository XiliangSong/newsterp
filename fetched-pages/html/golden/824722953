Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 ON Monday night inside the GlassLands Gallery, a converted warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 100 or so people, alerted by MySpace pages and music blogs, gathered for a concert by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. For an hour, the singer Karen O yelped and shrieked and pranced around a makeshift stage in a paint-splattered gold bodysuit, often wading into the audience a few feet away. At the end of the night the band took requests; to close the set, as her band mates played on, Ms. O paraded most of the crowd toward an alley behind the building, a musical moment as intimate as a reigning rock star can have. Skip to next paragraph Rock Off the Radar The Demimonde Doesn’t Vanish, It Just Changes Location “We hardly play small venues anymore, but this one is definitely special and personal,” Ms. O said afterward. “My favorite kind of party to be at or show to see is a house show. This is as close as you get.” Amid the teeter-totter energy that currently defines New York’s music scene — where the lamented demise of one club is offset by the splashier opening of another — many artists can be found outside that playground entirely, performing at off-the-beaten-path locales like warehouses, rooftops, apartments or inside a Brooklyn oil silo. Music fans with limited funds and a taste for adventure look forward to the summer concert season, which is about to turn the city’s parks and other public spaces into musical free-for-alls. But there are already many places to see bands for little money, without sellout crowds, ticket surcharges or security pat-downs. (Yes, Virginia, there’s even cheap beer.) And the lineups are diverse. Experimental music did not die with the closing of Tonic, nor did grungy rock with the fall of CBGB. With a little planning and an active MetroCard you might catch the next Arcade Fire performing in a parking lot. “Anything is a venue,” said the promoter Todd Patrick, known professionally as Todd P. For six years he has made it his mission to program music in far-flung places, from divey bars in Greenpoint to Lutheran churches to private lofts. Now New York’s alt-location guru, he has recently expanded to work with bands on the verge of stardom (Animal Collective, which he booked in 2005) and even nationally known acts (Oneida, Trans Am) at large clubs like Studio B in Brooklyn, winning the attention of the music industry. But Mr. Patrick’s hallmark remains the cheap, on-the-fly, do-it-yourself concert, promoted through his Web site ( ), his e-mail list (13,000 strong) and MySpace, blog and newspaper and magazine listings. Essentially a one-man band, Mr. Patrick, 31, has interns who work the door (ticket prices rarely go above $10) and stamp hands (he only does all-ages shows) while he helps set up. “Because the idea is about D.I.Y., I like to show the strings,” he said. “I want people to come to the show and see me build the P.A. system, see that there’s nothing glossy about what we’re doing. I think alternative venues are a great way of doing that. It just kind of throws it off. If a club is the quote-unquote appropriate place to see music, why do people have so much more fun in a warehouse?” Last weekend was typical: On Saturday night he booked shows at two unexpected spaces, an Ecuadorian restaurant across from a low-income housing project in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and a loft apartment in Ridgewood, Queens. Both drew several hundred people to outer-borough neighborhoods not typically known as destinations. The restaurant, Don Pedro, had a full menu of ceviche, $3 bottles of Negra Modelo and a small stage in a brick-walled back room where Cass McCombs, a singer with a Lou Reed croon, performed to a packed house. William Alberque, 36, a Defense Department analyst visiting from Washington and a longtime fan of Mr. McCombs’s, said he preferred seeing him anywhere but a rock club. “The D.I.Y. spirit is wonderful,” he said. “It’s just you and the band, five feet away. You buy into what’s happening so much more. It gives you musical butterflies.” At the loft there was even less distance (and more butterflies). The headliner, Dan Deacon, a sensitive electro-party rocker from Baltimore, performed on a patch of carpet in the middle of the room. No stage or bouncer separated him from his audience, which swarmed around, fists pumping, creating a heaving, dancing, steaming mosh pit. Even the walls vibrated.

It’s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. As such, it is a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is. Skip to next paragraph Benedict J. Fernandez/National Portrait Gallery The coffin of the Rev.

In terms of entertainment, the event is beyond compare. and Bill (Bojangles) Robinson dance. Sarah Vaughan, Leontyne Price and Odetta share a stage, with Sidney Bechet on sax, and Hazel Scott, looking divine, at the keyboard. You’d look divine too if you had James VanDerZee behind the camera, or Berenice Abbott or Edward Weston or Addison N. Scurlock or any of the other great photographers responsible for the 100 vintage-print portraits here, all from the archives of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery. There are more artists and writers than usual at such an affair. You’ll recognize Horace Pippin, Edmonia Lewis and a beaming Lorraine Hansberry, by name if not by face. And a few people you may be meeting for the first time. Ernest Everett Just (1883-1941), a pioneering biologist who spent much of his career in Europe after he was stonewalled by the American scientific establishment. And Henry Highland Garnet (1815-1882), a Maryland slave who escaped north, became an abolitionist firebrand and delivered the phrase that gives the show its title: “Strike for your lives and liberties. Rather die freemen than live to be slaves. Let your motto be resistance! Resistance! Resistance!” As you look around the gallery, you can imagine some of the portraits reacting to his call. Elizabeth Catlett (in a wonderful likeness by Mariana Yampolsky), A. Philip Randolph, , Sojourner Truth and a young, blanket-swaddled James Baldwin seem to hear it and they’re on the alert. Mr. Garnet’s words aren’t party words. They are stark, preaching, move-now words. Which brings us back to the kind of party this is. It is, as I said, a housewarming in advance, and a buzz-builder, for a national African-American museum. When that museum goes up on the National Mall — 2015 is the target date — an essential aspect of American history will have its official monument. America and African America are one and the same. They’re inseparable. If this show can be taken as a preview of exhibitions to come, what will that history look like? Obviously, it will have glamour to burn, to judge by the lush, burnished portraits chosen by the guest curator, Deborah Willis, a professor of photography at Roland Hayes, who sang like an angel, looks like an angel in a 1934 light-and-shadow likeness attributed to Johan Hagemeyer. floats like a butterfly for Philippe Halsman’s Vogue-savvy eye. One after another, people glow or glower. Everyone is a star, an inspiration, a certified member of W. E. B. DuBois’s Talented Tenth. This Hall of Fame approach to cultural history delivers thrills, no question. But it also has a too easy, been-there air. The show feels like a throwback to another era, to a kind of exhibition that might have been mounted 20 years ago at the Studio Museum in Harlem , an institution that was until recently deeply invested in black pride, devoted to ethnic uplift. That devotion was effective in its time. Among many other things, it encouraged the upward mobility of what has since become an economically and politically powerful black middle class. But is uplift on the same terms, for the same ends, the right framework for viewing African-American, or any other American, history in 2007? Is Bright and Beautiful the model to follow? The show doesn’t entirely adhere to the model. Wall texts make clear that almost every person portrayed had to fight bitter odds for a seat in front of the camera. Each likeness was, consciously or by default, an effort to cast the African-American image, distorted by racism, in acceptably positive, mainstream terms. Three images, set by side by side at the start of the show, make life-and-death stakes clear. In a 1956 picture the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — just a year after he had successfully used passive resistance as a tactical tool in Montgomery, Ala. — stands in the sunshine beside his smiling wife, Coretta, holding their infant daughter, Yolanda Denise, in his arms. In 1968 the same daughter, now in her teens, looks down at her murdered father in his coffin as her 5-year-old sister, Bernice, reacts with open-mouthed shock to the sight. A year later Stephen Shames catches the 25-year-old Angela Davis standing at a microphone, her mouth open to deliver a speech. Passive resistance is over; active resistance has begun. Significantly, some of the best things in the show are action shots: the Supremes — Diana, Mary and Flo — in a recording session; Stokely Carmichael and a white-suited Adam Clayton Powell Jr. cracking up at a joke; impassively hawking broadsides on the street; Marian Anderson singing as a skinny young These portraits are close to snapshots; their subjects look like regular people, Americans who happen to be black, in the middle of their accomplished lives. African America has, of course, a distinctive history, of profound pain and amazing grace. But the figures in these on-the-fly images are also part of a larger fabric: We the People. They are us; we are them. And with all our shared flaws and heroisms, we make up one mercurial, complicated, crazy quilt of a crew. Many of the young artists seen at the Studio Museum these days are intensely interested in complications, in giving “black” and “white” hard critical scrutiny, in consigning racial pride, along with all other essentialisms, to the shelf. Such artists resist the old, easy-chair version of history that this crowd-pleaser of a show comes too close to emulating. I hope the National Museum of African American History and Culture will resist it too, when it finally gets the home it should have had years ago at the heart of the nation. “Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits” continues through Sept. 9 at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street; (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

Lincoln Kirstein (1907-1996) is best remembered for founding with Balanchine the New York City Ballet and American School of Ballet. But as a friend of his put it, he had “more arms than Shiva.” Skip to next paragraph A show of artists Kirstein championed is at the Whitney and includes a portait of himself by Pavel Tchelitchew. 'The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein,' by Martin Duberman: A Paragon of the Arts, as Both Man and Titan 'The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein,' by Martin Duberman: The Outsider Insider Dance: Recalling Kirstein, Endearing Monster Metropolitan Museum of Art A portrait of Lincoln Kirstein as a college student, by Walker Evans. This charming exhibition is about a few of the visual artists he championed. The son of a prominent Boston merchant prince, Kirstein became involved with art during his undergraduate days at when he edited Hound and Horn and helped run the Society for Contemporary Art. Over the years he organized shows, collected art, wrote books and criticism for The New Republic, and gave struggling artists saving doses of money. During the middle decades of the last century Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art, with which he had collaborated early on but then came to oppose. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, Kirstein endorsed, among others, the artists in the show here. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein’s brother-in-law, and Pavel Tchelitchew, the flamboyant, socially connected Russian expatriate and set designer who became Kirstein’s good friend. The show also includes Walker Evans. Kirstein, long before most others, recognized photography as an art and Evans as a genius. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein’s taste clearly hasn’t won the day, but victory is not everything in matters of artistic rank. Impassioned contrarians like Kirstein have enriched the debate over American art since the 19th century, battling complacency and more than occasionally calling the bluff of avant-gardists who don’t have very good explanations for what they’re doing. It’s a pity that this show doesn’t venture further. At the Society for Contemporary Art Kirstein exhibited Calder and Noguchi. He pioneered writing about and film. At the Modern in the early 1930s he put together a show of mural paintings by Ben Shahn, Stuart Davis, Hugo Gellert and others, which provoked a ruckus with the museum board because much of the art was left-wing. It flopped with critics but deserves a fresh look, if only to recall Kirstein’s polemical zeal and fleeting Bolshevism. A decade later he roamed South America hunting for Latin American art for the Modern. It would be fascinating to unearth what he brought back. Lucian Freud started but never finished Kirstein’s portrait because they got into a fistfight. It should be seen alongside the portraits by Evans, Lachaise and Tchelitchew that the Whitney includes. That wasn’t all. Kirstein wrote about an obscure 19th-century British-American painter named William Rimmer. He married a painter, Fidelma Cadmus. And he enthused over Andrew Wyeth, Jamie Wyeth, George Tooker, Jared French, Henry Koerner and many others whom he truly believed would be remembered after , Beckmann and Dalí were relegated to storage. It hasn’t happened yet. “As for personal favorites, we all have them,” Kirstein once wrote to Lloyd Goodrich, who ran the Whitney during the 1940s. “My attitude is merely against the idea of improvisation, decoration, fragmentation and stylization.” Goodrich wrote back, “By too sweeping condemnation you can do great harm to artists and to the public’s relation to all living art.” They were both exaggerating. Kirstein couldn’t hold back in private. It wasn’t his nature. To his brother-in-law, a gentle soul, he wrote after seeing Cadmus’s painting called “Lust,” of a monstrous woman wrapped in a giant condom: “I do not understand your aching agony about the flesh. I suppose it partly comes from hating being queer” and from the “curdled Catholicism of your nasty youth. I think it is a romantic and immature attitude.” Kirstein, whose own sexuality was fluid, went on: “I don’t think anything as impermanent as flesh is corrupt. Lust isn’t so bad, it lasts no time at all and is not destructive.” How refreshing. Kirstein may be excused for resorting to a language of equivocation and innuendo in public. Explaining, in a book on Cadmus, the splay-legged sailors and naked men sharing a bathroom, he wrote, “As for sexual factors, he has without ostentation or polemic long celebrated somatic health in boys and young men for its symbolic range of human possibility.” Whatever. It was a different era. He liked Cadmus because representational art demanded measurable skill; it depended (here was the link to ballet) on established modes for exhibiting the human body. Out of it came the whole “symbolic range of human possibility.” So Cadmus leaned on Renaissance models. Lachaise looked at Egyptian statues when he sculptured Kirstein’s portrait as a naked man striding. (It’s in the show.) Tchelitchew’s dexterous but rather mysterious style, which is sometimes called visionary but is basically surreal, harked back to Leonardo. And Nadelman contrived urban-folk sculpture that celebrated traditional handicraft. “Lincoln Kirstein” continues through Aug. 27 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street; (212) 570-3676, whitney.org.

http://movies2.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/movies/11late.html	28 Weeks Later - Movies - Review - New York Times MOVIE REVIEW | '28 WEEKS LATER' MORE ON '28 Weeks Later' The Satire Is Biting, and So Are the Zombies Emily Beecham in &#34;28 Weeks Later,&#34; directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Nothing satisfies the appetite for allegory quite like a movie about flesh-eating zombies. Somehow the genre, at least as practiced by its masters, has the capacity to illuminate some brute facts about the human condition and its contemporary dysfunctions. There are not many recent movies that match, for example, the social criticism undertaken by George Romero in his “Living Dead” cycle. Skip to next paragraph Anatomy of a Scene: '28 Weeks Later' Movie Minutes: '28 Weeks Later' A group of Londoners run through a tunnel as London is being firebombed in &#34;28 Weeks Later.&#34; and its new sequel, directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, may not quite be in Mr. Romero’s league, but at their best they come close to his signature blend of grisly horror, emotional impact and biting satire. There is, of course, plenty of literal biting as well, since the virus-crazed creatures known as infecteds crave the flesh and blood of their erstwhile fellow citizens. And also their metaphorical flesh and blood. The first movie, set in the early days of a pandemic that nearly wiped out the population of Britain, followed a small band of strangers who came together to form a makeshift tribe. This time, after the first wave of the virus seems to have run its course, the focus is on families and comrades split apart and set against one another by paranoia, moral confusion and the endless conflict between the survival instinct and the call of duty. If “28 Days Later” was, in part, about the emergence of solidarity in the midst of crisis, “28 Weeks Later” is about the breakdown that occurs in what seems to be the aftermath. The DVD of Mr. Boyle’s film has two alternate endings, one slightly more comforting than the other. The hopeful conclusion (the one originally released in American theaters) turns out to be a slender thread leading to Mr. Fresnadillo’s more hectic and somewhat grimmer sequel. The story (written by Rowan Joffe, Mr. Fresnadillo, E. L. Lavigne and Jesus Olmo, with Mr. Boyle and his frequent collaborator, Alex Garland, on hand as executive producers) begins with a terrible failure of nerve. Fleeing a zombie attack, Don (a gaunt, appropriately anxious ) abandons his wife, Alice ( ), to a gruesome and apparently inevitable fate. A few months later, he is safe in the Green Zone, an island of security in London overseen by occupying American troops led by General Stone (Idris Elba). There, he is reunited with his children, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), who had been on a school trip to Spain during the initial outbreak. He lies to them about their mother’s fate, and his dishonesty is punished in due course. That bit about American soldiers patrolling the Green Zone — see what I mean about allegory? — may make “28 Weeks Later” sound heavy-handedly topical. But as in any good science fiction fable, the analogies it offers to contemporary reality are speculative rather than obvious. The initial benevolence of the occupation is clear enough: a shattered country needs to be put back together, its remaining population protected and reassured. It is only when things spin out of control that the inherent brutality of the situation becomes clear, but here again the movie poses intractable conundrums rather than scoring easy points. To the soldiers and the survivors alike, there are only bad choices, and doing what seems like the right thing — firebombing an open city or rescuing children from the bombs — can turn out to have horrendous consequences. Mr. Fresnadillo’s first movie, the Spanish-language thriller showed him to be a filmmaker with technical agility and a decidedly philosophical bent. Here the thinking is done on the run, as the collapse of order unfolds through scenes of panic and chaos. These are often too frenetically edited and murkily lighted to be truly scary, and the higher dose of gore — infecteds chopped up by helicopter blades; bodies exploding in blood as bullets fly into them — is not enough to increase the horror. The real terror comes at quieter moments, when aerial shots survey the echoing emptiness of London, or when Tammy and Andy sneak out of the Green Zone into the surrounding desolation. “London’s mine,” Andy exclaims, and the claustrophobic suspense of the film is occasionally leavened by a sense of adventure. The threat of death brings out noble impulses as well as selfish ones. Don’s cowardice stands in contrast to the selflessness of some of the American soldiers: Scarlet (Rose Byrne), a medical officer; Doyle (Jeremy Renner), a sniper whose conscience gets the better of him; and, more reluctantly, Flynn (Harold Perrineau), a chopper pilot with pictures of his kids taped above the windshield. “28 Weeks Later” is not for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach. It is brutal and almost exhaustingly terrifying, as any respectable zombie movie should be. It is also bracingly smart, both in its ideas and in its techniques. The last shot brought a burst of laughter at the screening I attended, a reaction that seemed to me both an acknowledgment of Mr. Fresnadillo’s wit and a defense against his merciless rigor. Anyway, I was glad the person next to me was laughing, rather than chewing through my neck.

Lincoln Kirstein (1907-1996) is best remembered for founding with Balanchine the New York City Ballet and American School of Ballet. But as a friend of his put it, he had “more arms than Shiva.” Skip to next paragraph A show of artists Kirstein championed is at the Whitney and includes a portait of himself by Pavel Tchelitchew. 'The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein,' by Martin Duberman: A Paragon of the Arts, as Both Man and Titan 'The Worlds of Lincoln Kirstein,' by Martin Duberman: The Outsider Insider Dance: Recalling Kirstein, Endearing Monster Metropolitan Museum of Art A portrait of Lincoln Kirstein as a college student, by Walker Evans. This charming exhibition is about a few of the visual artists he championed. The son of a prominent Boston merchant prince, Kirstein became involved with art during his undergraduate days at when he edited Hound and Horn and helped run the Society for Contemporary Art. Over the years he organized shows, collected art, wrote books and criticism for The New Republic, and gave struggling artists saving doses of money. During the middle decades of the last century Kirstein particularly relished attacking the Museum of Modern Art, with which he had collaborated early on but then came to oppose. Pure abstraction was ridiculous, he thought. It had no standards. Against Mondrian and Pollock, Kirstein endorsed, among others, the artists in the show here. They are the sculptors Elie Nadelman and Gaston Lachaise and the painters Paul Cadmus, who was Kirstein’s brother-in-law, and Pavel Tchelitchew, the flamboyant, socially connected Russian expatriate and set designer who became Kirstein’s good friend. The show also includes Walker Evans. Kirstein, long before most others, recognized photography as an art and Evans as a genius. With the exception of Evans, Kirstein’s taste clearly hasn’t won the day, but victory is not everything in matters of artistic rank. Impassioned contrarians like Kirstein have enriched the debate over American art since the 19th century, battling complacency and more than occasionally calling the bluff of avant-gardists who don’t have very good explanations for what they’re doing. It’s a pity that this show doesn’t venture further. At the Society for Contemporary Art Kirstein exhibited Calder and Noguchi. He pioneered writing about and film. At the Modern in the early 1930s he put together a show of mural paintings by Ben Shahn, Stuart Davis, Hugo Gellert and others, which provoked a ruckus with the museum board because much of the art was left-wing. It flopped with critics but deserves a fresh look, if only to recall Kirstein’s polemical zeal and fleeting Bolshevism. A decade later he roamed South America hunting for Latin American art for the Modern. It would be fascinating to unearth what he brought back. Lucian Freud started but never finished Kirstein’s portrait because they got into a fistfight. It should be seen alongside the portraits by Evans, Lachaise and Tchelitchew that the Whitney includes. That wasn’t all. Kirstein wrote about an obscure 19th-century British-American painter named William Rimmer. He married a painter, Fidelma Cadmus. And he enthused over Andrew Wyeth, Jamie Wyeth, George Tooker, Jared French, Henry Koerner and many others whom he truly believed would be remembered after , Beckmann and Dalí were relegated to storage. It hasn’t happened yet. “As for personal favorites, we all have them,” Kirstein once wrote to Lloyd Goodrich, who ran the Whitney during the 1940s. “My attitude is merely against the idea of improvisation, decoration, fragmentation and stylization.” Goodrich wrote back, “By too sweeping condemnation you can do great harm to artists and to the public’s relation to all living art.” They were both exaggerating. Kirstein couldn’t hold back in private. It wasn’t his nature. To his brother-in-law, a gentle soul, he wrote after seeing Cadmus’s painting called “Lust,” of a monstrous woman wrapped in a giant condom: “I do not understand your aching agony about the flesh. I suppose it partly comes from hating being queer” and from the “curdled Catholicism of your nasty youth. I think it is a romantic and immature attitude.” Kirstein, whose own sexuality was fluid, went on: “I don’t think anything as impermanent as flesh is corrupt. Lust isn’t so bad, it lasts no time at all and is not destructive.” How refreshing. Kirstein may be excused for resorting to a language of equivocation and innuendo in public. Explaining, in a book on Cadmus, the splay-legged sailors and naked men sharing a bathroom, he wrote, “As for sexual factors, he has without ostentation or polemic long celebrated somatic health in boys and young men for its symbolic range of human possibility.” Whatever. It was a different era. He liked Cadmus because representational art demanded measurable skill; it depended (here was the link to ballet) on established modes for exhibiting the human body. Out of it came the whole “symbolic range of human possibility.” So Cadmus leaned on Renaissance models. Lachaise looked at Egyptian statues when he sculptured Kirstein’s portrait as a naked man striding. (It’s in the show.) Tchelitchew’s dexterous but rather mysterious style, which is sometimes called visionary but is basically surreal, harked back to Leonardo. And Nadelman contrived urban-folk sculpture that celebrated traditional handicraft. “Lincoln Kirstein” continues through Aug. 27 at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street; (212) 570-3676, whitney.org.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 “Poiret: King of Fashion,” the Metropolitan Museum of Art ’s sumptuous survey of the designs of the French couturier Paul Poiret (1879-1944), will transform your understanding of the origin of modern fashion. Its radiant hand-painted silk backdrops may also increase your appreciation of the art of set design; they magically create an immersive beauty out of almost nothing. Skip to next paragraph Man Ray Trust/Artists Rights Society (ARS)/ADAGP A 1923 Man Ray photograph of Peggy Guggenheim wearing a dress by Poiret. Poiret’s achievement is not as visible today as that of Coco Chanel, who built on some of his ideas and discarded others. His fashion house closed in 1929, and he spent his remaining years impoverished. But Poiret was for a while a revolutionary in revolutionary times and also a canny impresario. His radically streamlined, unstructured, often stridently colored clothes freed women from corsets while evoking exotic, non-Western cultures and a fierce disregard for social convention. He introduced these corset-free garments in 1906, the year before committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) “Demoiselles d’Avignon” to canvas. But with his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern, and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, Poiret most resembles Poiret functioned as a kind of one-man cultural scene. He collected art, gave lavish costume parties and made astute use of the press while laying the groundwork for fashion design as a modern art and a modern business. His clients included , Nancy Cunard, Isadora Duncan, Colette and Helena Rubinstein. Man Ray photographed Peggy Guggenheim in a Poiret gown and turban. Edward Steichen’s first fashion photographs were taken of models in Poiret’s atelier. He was the first designer to understand the value of designing for well-known actresses both onstage and off. He was also the first to create his own line of perfume, named Rosine, for his eldest daughter, and the first to open an interior design store, Atelier Martine, named for his second daughter but inspired by the Weiner Werkstätte. His innovations included the chemise, harem pants and pantaloons and the popular lampshade skirt. When he visited the United States in 1913, he found himself called the king of fashion and discovered the underside of modern fashion success: His lampshade skirt was being copied far and wide. Organized by Harold Koda and Andrew Bolton, who are curator in charge and curator of the Met’s , “Poiret: King of Fashion” conveys quite a bit of his complex genius and his contradictory relationship with modernity. It displays 50 garments on mannequins (by Beyond Design) whose ovoid faces and cryptic features evoke Brancusi and Modigliani. The silk backdrops, which are the work of Jean-Hugues de Chatillon, a French set designer who served as the exhibition’s creative consultant, accent the show’s spaciousness with indelibly Parisian vistas of leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms. All told you may have the sensation of drifting through a series of extraordinarily beautiful fashion illustrations, an art that Poiret cultivated to his advantage. Poiret’s liberation of the female body was in part inspired by the gamine build and independent spirit of his wife and muse, Denise, whom he married in 1905. In other ways it was born of necessity. Although he was initiated into the couturier business between 1898 and 1903, working as a designer for Jacques Doucet and then the House of Worth, Poiret never trained in the exacting crafts of couture tailoring or dressmaking. His design ideas began with the flat, rectangle of the fabric itself, as did the Japanese kimonos and North African caftans he admired. They then evolved through draping, not tailoring, into garments with a minimum of seams that pretty much hung from the shoulders. Poiret drew from a broad range of sources. Early in the show there is a trio of nightgowns, based on the Classical Greek gown known as the chiton, that are precursors to the 1950s negligee and the early 21st-century socialite party dress. To one side of these are two white high-waisted dresses that hark back to the severe yet demure gowns of post-Revolution France, displayed with an Atelier Martine chair that has bubbly hand-painted fabric. Nearby is evidence of Poiret’s attraction to a more ornate form of non-Western dress: a gauzy harem outfit studded with enormous beads of turquoise celluloid that Denise might have worn to their most famous fete, “The Thousand and Second Night” costume party on June 24, 1911. But turn around and you will see a stark simplicity that may take you aback: a gown that resembles nothing so much as a 1960s abstract painting. Wrapped gracefully around a mannequin, it has no sleeves or collar to speak of, just four broad, alternating bands of stylishly darkened red and blue. “Poiret: King of Fashion” is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Aug. 5.

http://movies2.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/movies/11late.html?ex=1336536000&en=08b42f416e1ef2fc&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss	28 Weeks Later - Movies - Review - New York Times MOVIE REVIEW | '28 WEEKS LATER' MORE ON '28 Weeks Later' The Satire Is Biting, and So Are the Zombies Emily Beecham in &#34;28 Weeks Later,&#34; directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Nothing satisfies the appetite for allegory quite like a movie about flesh-eating zombies. Somehow the genre, at least as practiced by its masters, has the capacity to illuminate some brute facts about the human condition and its contemporary dysfunctions. There are not many recent movies that match, for example, the social criticism undertaken by George Romero in his “Living Dead” cycle. Skip to next paragraph Anatomy of a Scene: '28 Weeks Later' Movie Minutes: '28 Weeks Later' A group of Londoners run through a tunnel as London is being firebombed in &#34;28 Weeks Later.&#34; and its new sequel, directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, may not quite be in Mr. Romero’s league, but at their best they come close to his signature blend of grisly horror, emotional impact and biting satire. There is, of course, plenty of literal biting as well, since the virus-crazed creatures known as infecteds crave the flesh and blood of their erstwhile fellow citizens. And also their metaphorical flesh and blood. The first movie, set in the early days of a pandemic that nearly wiped out the population of Britain, followed a small band of strangers who came together to form a makeshift tribe. This time, after the first wave of the virus seems to have run its course, the focus is on families and comrades split apart and set against one another by paranoia, moral confusion and the endless conflict between the survival instinct and the call of duty. If “28 Days Later” was, in part, about the emergence of solidarity in the midst of crisis, “28 Weeks Later” is about the breakdown that occurs in what seems to be the aftermath. The DVD of Mr. Boyle’s film has two alternate endings, one slightly more comforting than the other. The hopeful conclusion (the one originally released in American theaters) turns out to be a slender thread leading to Mr. Fresnadillo’s more hectic and somewhat grimmer sequel. The story (written by Rowan Joffe, Mr. Fresnadillo, E. L. Lavigne and Jesus Olmo, with Mr. Boyle and his frequent collaborator, Alex Garland, on hand as executive producers) begins with a terrible failure of nerve. Fleeing a zombie attack, Don (a gaunt, appropriately anxious ) abandons his wife, Alice ( ), to a gruesome and apparently inevitable fate. A few months later, he is safe in the Green Zone, an island of security in London overseen by occupying American troops led by General Stone (Idris Elba). There, he is reunited with his children, Andy (Mackintosh Muggleton) and Tammy (Imogen Poots), who had been on a school trip to Spain during the initial outbreak. He lies to them about their mother’s fate, and his dishonesty is punished in due course. That bit about American soldiers patrolling the Green Zone — see what I mean about allegory? — may make “28 Weeks Later” sound heavy-handedly topical. But as in any good science fiction fable, the analogies it offers to contemporary reality are speculative rather than obvious. The initial benevolence of the occupation is clear enough: a shattered country needs to be put back together, its remaining population protected and reassured. It is only when things spin out of control that the inherent brutality of the situation becomes clear, but here again the movie poses intractable conundrums rather than scoring easy points. To the soldiers and the survivors alike, there are only bad choices, and doing what seems like the right thing — firebombing an open city or rescuing children from the bombs — can turn out to have horrendous consequences. Mr. Fresnadillo’s first movie, the Spanish-language thriller showed him to be a filmmaker with technical agility and a decidedly philosophical bent. Here the thinking is done on the run, as the collapse of order unfolds through scenes of panic and chaos. These are often too frenetically edited and murkily lighted to be truly scary, and the higher dose of gore — infecteds chopped up by helicopter blades; bodies exploding in blood as bullets fly into them — is not enough to increase the horror. The real terror comes at quieter moments, when aerial shots survey the echoing emptiness of London, or when Tammy and Andy sneak out of the Green Zone into the surrounding desolation. “London’s mine,” Andy exclaims, and the claustrophobic suspense of the film is occasionally leavened by a sense of adventure. The threat of death brings out noble impulses as well as selfish ones. Don’s cowardice stands in contrast to the selflessness of some of the American soldiers: Scarlet (Rose Byrne), a medical officer; Doyle (Jeremy Renner), a sniper whose conscience gets the better of him; and, more reluctantly, Flynn (Harold Perrineau), a chopper pilot with pictures of his kids taped above the windshield. “28 Weeks Later” is not for the faint of heart or the weak of stomach. It is brutal and almost exhaustingly terrifying, as any respectable zombie movie should be. It is also bracingly smart, both in its ideas and in its techniques. The last shot brought a burst of laughter at the screening I attended, a reaction that seemed to me both an acknowledgment of Mr. Fresnadillo’s wit and a defense against his merciless rigor. Anyway, I was glad the person next to me was laughing, rather than chewing through my neck. That level of horror will have to wait for the next sequel. “28 Weeks Later” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Rabid zombies feast on living flesh, which causes their potential victims to utter an occasional obscenity. Directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo; written by Rowan Joffe, Mr. Fresnadillo, E. L.

It’s also a fancy-dress inaugural party for the yet-to-be-built National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. As such, it is a little too fancy, too heavy on glitz, too short on grit. Still, what a party it is. Skip to next paragraph Benedict J. Fernandez/National Portrait Gallery The coffin of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. surrounded by mourners, including his children, in the show &#147;Let Your Motto Be Resistance.&#148; Estate of Linda McCartney/National Portrait Gallery Jimi Hendrix in 1967, one of the glamorous shots in the exhibition. The guest list includes an abbreviated Who’s Who of charismatic black statesmen, from Frederick Douglass to Malcolm X. In terms of entertainment, the event is beyond compare. and Bill (Bojangles) Robinson dance. Sarah Vaughan, Leontyne Price and Odetta share a stage, with Sidney Bechet on sax, and Hazel Scott, looking divine, at the keyboard. You’d look divine too if you had James VanDerZee behind the camera, or Berenice Abbott or Edward Weston or Addison N. Scurlock or any of the other great photographers responsible for the 100 vintage-print portraits here, all from the archives of the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery. There are more artists and writers than usual at such an affair. You’ll recognize Horace Pippin, Edmonia Lewis and a beaming Lorraine Hansberry, by name if not by face. And a few people you may be meeting for the first time. Ernest Everett Just (1883-1941), a pioneering biologist who spent much of his career in Europe after he was stonewalled by the American scientific establishment. And Henry Highland Garnet (1815-1882), a Maryland slave who escaped north, became an abolitionist firebrand and delivered the phrase that gives the show its title: “Strike for your lives and liberties. Rather die freemen than live to be slaves. Let your motto be resistance! Resistance! Resistance!” As you look around the gallery, you can imagine some of the portraits reacting to his call. Elizabeth Catlett (in a wonderful likeness by Mariana Yampolsky), A. Philip Randolph, , Sojourner Truth and a young, blanket-swaddled James Baldwin seem to hear it and they’re on the alert. Mr. Garnet’s words aren’t party words. They are stark, preaching, move-now words. Which brings us back to the kind of party this is. It is, as I said, a housewarming in advance, and a buzz-builder, for a national African-American museum. When that museum goes up on the National Mall — 2015 is the target date — an essential aspect of American history will have its official monument. America and African America are one and the same. They’re inseparable. If this show can be taken as a preview of exhibitions to come, what will that history look like? Obviously, it will have glamour to burn, to judge by the lush, burnished portraits chosen by the guest curator, Deborah Willis, a professor of photography at Roland Hayes, who sang like an angel, looks like an angel in a 1934 light-and-shadow likeness attributed to Johan Hagemeyer. floats like a butterfly for Philippe Halsman’s Vogue-savvy eye. One after another, people glow or glower. Everyone is a star, an inspiration, a certified member of W. E. B. DuBois’s Talented Tenth. This Hall of Fame approach to cultural history delivers thrills, no question. But it also has a too easy, been-there air. The show feels like a throwback to another era, to a kind of exhibition that might have been mounted 20 years ago at the Studio Museum in Harlem , an institution that was until recently deeply invested in black pride, devoted to ethnic uplift. That devotion was effective in its time. Among many other things, it encouraged the upward mobility of what has since become an economically and politically powerful black middle class. But is uplift on the same terms, for the same ends, the right framework for viewing African-American, or any other American, history in 2007? Is Bright and Beautiful the model to follow? The show doesn’t entirely adhere to the model. Wall texts make clear that almost every person portrayed had to fight bitter odds for a seat in front of the camera. Each likeness was, consciously or by default, an effort to cast the African-American image, distorted by racism, in acceptably positive, mainstream terms. Three images, set by side by side at the start of the show, make life-and-death stakes clear. In a 1956 picture the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — just a year after he had successfully used passive resistance as a tactical tool in Montgomery, Ala. — stands in the sunshine beside his smiling wife, Coretta, holding their infant daughter, Yolanda Denise, in his arms. In 1968 the same daughter, now in her teens, looks down at her murdered father in his coffin as her 5-year-old sister, Bernice, reacts with open-mouthed shock to the sight. A year later Stephen Shames catches the 25-year-old Angela Davis standing at a microphone, her mouth open to deliver a speech. Passive resistance is over; active resistance has begun. Significantly, some of the best things in the show are action shots: the Supremes — Diana, Mary and Flo — in a recording session; Stokely Carmichael and a white-suited Adam Clayton Powell Jr. cracking up at a joke; impassively hawking broadsides on the street; Marian Anderson singing as a skinny young These portraits are close to snapshots; their subjects look like regular people, Americans who happen to be black, in the middle of their accomplished lives. African America has, of course, a distinctive history, of profound pain and amazing grace. But the figures in these on-the-fly images are also part of a larger fabric: We the People. They are us; we are them. And with all our shared flaws and heroisms, we make up one mercurial, complicated, crazy quilt of a crew. Many of the young artists seen at the Studio Museum these days are intensely interested in complications, in giving “black” and “white” hard critical scrutiny, in consigning racial pride, along with all other essentialisms, to the shelf. Such artists resist the old, easy-chair version of history that this crowd-pleaser of a show comes too close to emulating. I hope the National Museum of African American History and Culture will resist it too, when it finally gets the home it should have had years ago at the heart of the nation. “Let Your Motto Be Resistance: African American Portraits” continues through Sept. 9 at the International Center of Photography, 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street; (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 “Poiret: King of Fashion,” the Metropolitan Museum of Art ’s sumptuous survey of the designs of the French couturier Paul Poiret (1879-1944), will transform your understanding of the origin of modern fashion. Its radiant hand-painted silk backdrops may also increase your appreciation of the art of set design; they magically create an immersive beauty out of almost nothing. Skip to next paragraph Man Ray Trust/Artists Rights Society (ARS)/ADAGP A 1923 Man Ray photograph of Peggy Guggenheim wearing a dress by Poiret. Poiret’s achievement is not as visible today as that of Coco Chanel, who built on some of his ideas and discarded others. His fashion house closed in 1929, and he spent his remaining years impoverished. But Poiret was for a while a revolutionary in revolutionary times and also a canny impresario. His radically streamlined, unstructured, often stridently colored clothes freed women from corsets while evoking exotic, non-Western cultures and a fierce disregard for social convention. He introduced these corset-free garments in 1906, the year before committed his decidedly uninhibited (and unstaid) “Demoiselles d’Avignon” to canvas. But with his love of the exotic, his brilliant use of color and pattern, and his penchant for simplified, almost rudimentary form, Poiret most resembles Poiret functioned as a kind of one-man cultural scene. He collected art, gave lavish costume parties and made astute use of the press while laying the groundwork for fashion design as a modern art and a modern business. His clients included , Nancy Cunard, Isadora Duncan, Colette and Helena Rubinstein. Man Ray photographed Peggy Guggenheim in a Poiret gown and turban. Edward Steichen’s first fashion photographs were taken of models in Poiret’s atelier. He was the first designer to understand the value of designing for well-known actresses both onstage and off. He was also the first to create his own line of perfume, named Rosine, for his eldest daughter, and the first to open an interior design store, Atelier Martine, named for his second daughter but inspired by the Weiner Werkstätte. His innovations included the chemise, harem pants and pantaloons and the popular lampshade skirt. When he visited the United States in 1913, he found himself called the king of fashion and discovered the underside of modern fashion success: His lampshade skirt was being copied far and wide. Organized by Harold Koda and Andrew Bolton, who are curator in charge and curator of the Met’s , “Poiret: King of Fashion” conveys quite a bit of his complex genius and his contradictory relationship with modernity. It displays 50 garments on mannequins (by Beyond Design) whose ovoid faces and cryptic features evoke Brancusi and Modigliani. The silk backdrops, which are the work of Jean-Hugues de Chatillon, a French set designer who served as the exhibition’s creative consultant, accent the show’s spaciousness with indelibly Parisian vistas of leafy parks, chic theaters and luxurious drawing rooms. All told you may have the sensation of drifting through a series of extraordinarily beautiful fashion illustrations, an art that Poiret cultivated to his advantage. Poiret’s liberation of the female body was in part inspired by the gamine build and independent spirit of his wife and muse, Denise, whom he married in 1905. In other ways it was born of necessity. Although he was initiated into the couturier business between 1898 and 1903, working as a designer for Jacques Doucet and then the House of Worth, Poiret never trained in the exacting crafts of couture tailoring or dressmaking. His design ideas began with the flat, rectangle of the fabric itself, as did the Japanese kimonos and North African caftans he admired. They then evolved through draping, not tailoring, into garments with a minimum of seams that pretty much hung from the shoulders. Poiret drew from a broad range of sources. Early in the show there is a trio of nightgowns, based on the Classical Greek gown known as the chiton, that are precursors to the 1950s negligee and the early 21st-century socialite party dress. To one side of these are two white high-waisted dresses that hark back to the severe yet demure gowns of post-Revolution France, displayed with an Atelier Martine chair that has bubbly hand-painted fabric. Nearby is evidence of Poiret’s attraction to a more ornate form of non-Western dress: a gauzy harem outfit studded with enormous beads of turquoise celluloid that Denise might have worn to their most famous fete, “The Thousand and Second Night” costume party on June 24, 1911. But turn around and you will see a stark simplicity that may take you aback: a gown that resembles nothing so much as a 1960s abstract painting. Wrapped gracefully around a mannequin, it has no sleeves or collar to speak of, just four broad, alternating bands of stylishly darkened red and blue. “Poiret: King of Fashion” is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Aug. 5.

It was a few days before the staff at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, at 135th Street and Boulevard in Harlem, finished hanging two exhibitions and stripping the paper off the doors at its bigger, brighter new entrance. Amid the sounds of hammers and drills, they prepared for tomorrow’s public celebration of the center’s two-year, $11 million renovation. Skip to next paragraph Ruby Washington/The New York Times A 1925 sign from the New York Public Library&#146;s Negro division. Ruby Washington/The New York Times The new facade at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. The Schomburg is as much a monument to an idea as it is a building. So those ghosts, workaday and luminous, inhabit a space of many incarnations, tracing its roots back to the 135th Street New York Public Library branch that opened there in 1905. Predominantly Jewish then, Harlem was mostly black by 1924. Over the years, Alex Haley researched “Roots” at the Schomburg; James Baldwin and both found it a refuge; a young honed his craft there. By the time it officially became the Schomburg in 1972, taking its name from Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, the Puerto Rican-born black bibliophile who donated his collection, it was a one-stop connection with the global black experience. Its wonders include a rare recording of a Marcus Garvey speech, documents signed by Toussaint L’Ouverture, a signed first edition of Phillis Wheatley’s poetry, daguerreotypes of African-Americans from the 1830s, Benjamin Banneker’s almanacs. Its exhibitions have tracked black migration and displayed the contents of Malcolm X’s pocket when he was gunned down at the Audubon Ballroom. “The center has increasingly become one of the cultural anchors of the greater Harlem community, one of the top three tourist destinations, along with the Apollo and the Studio Museum in Harlem ,” said Howard Dodson, the Schomburg director. “The kind of change that’s taking place in Harlem is of political, social and historical interest to the center, and we’ll be here to document it. We are not going anywhere.” As the Schomburg unveils its facelift, Harlem itself is also undergoing one of its periodic renaissances. There’s new real estate development, new stores and restaurants, new places to imbibe culture. The association with Harlem has been the constant for the Schomburg trove of more than five million items: art, manuscripts, films, photographs. The center has been a place for community meetings and for local politicians, for schoolchildren and eminent researchers like the historian John Hope Franklin. Thelma Golden, the director and chief curator of the Studio Museum, is among those who see the renovated Schomburg as an emblem of a Harlem at the top of its game. Hundreds of thousands of tourists pour into Harlem annually to shop in the stores on 125th Street, sit in the pews of the historic Abyssinian Baptist Church or revel in the serendipity of finding new cafes or dowager buildings. “The Schomburg stands as a bearer of the idea that our history and culture are important,” said Ms. Golden, who is African-American. “The renovation will reinvent the sense of the institution as living, breathing space. All the cultural institutions in Harlem are going through a period of incredible growth, and it’s not just about physical renovation.” A walk through Harlem makes vivid its embrace of many worlds. There are the tiny African braiding shops, mom-and-pop restaurants with an African or Caribbean flavor, as well as Citarella and Starbucks amid the cacophony of 125th Street, the area’s commercial spine. It is dotted with stores like Old Navy, as well as the Apollo and the Studio Museum. The streets are cleaner and safer than they have been in years. With its hilly topography and low-slung buildings framing the sky, these days Harlem is also a beehive of brownstone renovation and new construction. A few blocks from the Schomburg, condominiums are going up on either side of the street. Take a side street and you may glimpse decrepit apartment buildings or well-tended row houses shrouded in quiet. The new incarnation of the Schomburg Center, designed by the firm Dattner Architects, has more open spaces, light wood and glass, and is intended to be both more inviting and more distinctive than the old building. The center is part of the New York Public Library; the renovation was primarily financed by the city, with additional state support. The other day Mr. Dodson ticked off his plans for the center’s new resources, which include the latest technology. They include working with the Overtown community in Miami to develop an African diaspora heritage trail and helping officials in Liberia and South Africa to develop archives. Closer to home, the Schomburg is involved with the African Burial Ground project. In 1991 workers excavating the foundation for a new building uncovered human remains, which turned out to be from the site where historians say 15,000 slaves were buried from 1640 to 1795 on nearly seven acres near what is now City Hall Park and the Municipal Building. President Bush has proclaimed part of the space a national monument. On May 19 the papers donated by the family of Malcolm X will go on display at the Schomburg.
