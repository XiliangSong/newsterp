The former Heisman Trophy winner, who spent last season with the CFL's Toronto Argonauts while serving an NFL drug suspension, has reportedly tested positive again for marijuana, according to The Associated Press, citing a person familiar with the case. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because of the confidential nature of the testing program. Williams, through his agent, Leigh Steinberg, issued a statement to The Associated Press on Friday night. "Due to the recent reports about me failing a drug test, I feel it is appropriate for me to issue this statement. Last month, following a psychological evaluation requested by the NFL, we - the psychiatrist and I - came to the realization that there were a few things I needed to iron out about myself in order to make my return to the NFL as successful as possible. "I am an honest, God-fearing man who is intensely dedicated to being the best person I can be on and off the football field. There is no need to smear my name or to defame my character for the sake of news. When the time is right, God willing, I will be back on the field scoring touchdowns for whatever team is fortunate enough to believe in me." The Dolphins and NFL both declined comment. Williams had applied to the NFL for reinstatement in April. A positive test would derail his comeback. Toronto Argos president Keith Pelley said he doubts the positive test. But he also said Williams can't play north of the border. "I can say definitively that will not be back (in the CFL) this year," Pelley told reporters Friday. "The thing is we're dealing with a rumour and even if the rumour does in fact become reality, I'm not sure I believe it. "I've had a wonderful relationship with Ricky and believe he's a special human being. I would lean towards this being a false positive." The CFL's board of governors adopted a code of conduct policy this off-season that prevents Canadian teams from signing players under suspension by the NFL, Pelley said. Williams, who turns 30 on May 21, was suspended in April 2006 by then NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue following a fourth violation of the league's substance abuse policy. However, he signed a one-year C$240,000 contract with Toronto after receiving permission from the Miami Dolphins - who own Williams' NFL rights - to play in Canada while serving the suspension. Williams' CFL deal didn't include an option for 2007, which left him free to leave Toronto at season's end and apply for reinstatement into the NFL. Williams' arrival in Toronto drew criticism for the CFL for failing to honour an NFL's suspension and allowing one of its teams to sign a player already under contract to another club. Williams won the 1998 Heisman Trophy at Texas and led the NFL in rushing in 2002 while with Miami. But he has played in just 12 games south of the border since '03. Another positive drug test could also put Williams in line for additional punishment from the NFL. Williams enjoyed limited success with Toronto last year, rushing for 526 yards on 109 carries and two touchdowns but did miss two months with a broken arm and Achilles tendon injury. The Argos finished second in the East Division behind Montreal before dispatching Winnipeg in the conference semifinal. However, Williams' CFL tenure ended with a 33-24 loss to the Alouettes in the East final. From the first day Williams arrived here, it was clear he wasn't a typical football player. He never spoke using sports cliches, instead he articulately voiced his beliefs of living in the moment, of never having expectations of situations, his love of yoga and being a strict vegetarian. More importantly, the five-foot-10, 225-pound Williams seemed to work hard to fit in with his teammates. Many spoke glowingly of Williams' humility. Through it all, he was continually drug-tested by the NFL, without incident. "I've got no regrets about at all," Pelley said. "He was a model citizen here. "The only regret is he didn't run for 2,000 yards and we didn't win a Grey Cup. It was heart-breaking to lose the East final last year and watch Ricky in the dressing room, knowing he wasn't going to get an opportunity to play in the Grey Cup." Williams still owes the Dolphins US$8.6 million for breaching his contract when he sat out the 2004 season, but they've given no signal they want him back. The dust has settled. The Raiders took JaMarcus Russell at one and the Browns nabbed Brady Quinn after a long drop down the board. Check out everything you need to know about who went where on TSN.ca's draft page.

His emphatic answer to participating in last weekend's dustup: eight scoreless innings against New York. Mariners shut down Yankees The Yankees' Johnny Damon breaks a bat as he grounds out against the Mariners in Seattle in the third inning. New York was shut out, 3-0. (JOHN FROSCHAUER/ASSOCIATED PRESS) By Associated Press | Jarrod Washburn got another shot at the New York Yankees, five days after taking part in a controversy at Yankee Stadium. His emphatic answer to participating in last weekend's dustup: eight scoreless innings against New York. Washburn allowed six hits and struck out a season-high six and Kenji Johjima hit a two-run home run to lead the host Seattle Mariners to a 3-0 victory last night. In his previous start, Washburn hit Josh Phelps in the back with a pitch, after Phelps had bowled over catcher Johjima at home plate. When Yankees reliever Scott Proctor retaliated later in the game, he and manager Joe Torre were ejected and eventually suspended. "It was appreciated, I know that," Washburn said of his old-school response. "We've got to stick up for our teammates . . . That's just one of the pieces to the puzzle." Last night, Washburn (3-3) stymied the Yankees by dominating the inner-half of the strike zone, and retiring his final eight batters. The final one was Hideki Matsui, who flailed at a pitch in the dirt. "Washburn had a second gear tonight," said Johnny Damon, who went 1 for 4. It was the first time in 10 starts against New York that Washburn has held the Yankees scoreless. Washburn has allowed three runs or fewer six times in seven starts this season. "He's pitched well enough to be 6-0," Mariners manager Mike Hargrove said. Nationals 6, Marlins 0 -- Shawn Hill threw five no-hit innings before leaving with a sore right elbow, helping host Washington end an eight-game losing streak. Hill (3-3) walked two and retired the other 15 batters he faced. He took the mound to start the sixth but left without throwing a pitch, and reliever Winston Abreu kept the Marlins hitless through that inning. Padres 7, Cardinals 0 -- San Diego ace Jake Peavy became the first pitcher in franchise history to strike out at least 10 in four straight starts, holding visiting St. Louis to three hits in seven scoreless innings in its victory over the defending World Series champion. Russell Branyan hit a pair of two-run homers and Khalil Greene drove in two runs, including on a solo shot. Blue Jays 5, Devil Rays 1 -- A.J. Burnett struck out a season-high 10 to win for the first time in three starts and host Toronto ended a nine-game losing streak. Burnett (3-3) allowed one run and five hits with a season-high five walks in 6 2/3 innings. Athletics 8, Indians 2 -- Jack Cust drove in four runs to help host Oakland beat C.C. Sabathia and Cleveland. Tigers 7, Twins 3 -- Mike Maroth allowed one run in 6 2/3 innings and Carlos Guillen homered and drove in four runs to help visiting Detroit beat Minnesota. Detroit has won all seven of Maroth's starts this season. Angels 6, Rangers 3 -- John Lackey pitched into the ninth inning before departing after Sammy Sosa's 596th career homer and Los Angeles won in Arlington, Texas. White Sox 2, Royals 1 -- Jon Garland (2-2) held the Royals without a run for eight innings and host Chicago beat Kansas City. Giants 8, Rockies 3 -- Colorado pitcher Josh Fogg took a no-hitter into the sixth inning only to see it evaporate, and the Giants' Tim Lincecum earned his first major league win for visiting San Francisco. Phillies 7, Cubs 2 -- Pat Burrell homered twice and drove in five runs, Cole Hamels pitched seven strong innings, and host Philadelphia beat Chicago. Dodgers 2, Reds 0 -- Randy Wolf (4-3) struck out a season-high 11 in seven innings and Los Angeles got its seventh consecutive win over visiting Cincinnati. Diamondbacks 3, Astros 1 -- Chris Young hit two solo home runs and Brandon Webb shut down the Astros for his sixth career complete game to lead Arizona. Braves 4, Pirates 1 -- Andruw Jones and Jeff Francoeur homered on consecutive pitches in the sixth inning to help visiting Atlanta end its longest streak without a home run at 72 innings. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

May 11th, 2007 - 22:10:21 I really have a problem with this, but not for the reason most people have a problem with this. Ricky Williams is a pothead and has always been a pothead from his high school days, to his career in the NFL. While he was smoking marijuana, he won a Heisman Trophy, lead the league in rushing, and was one of the elite running backs in the NFL. This just proves that marijuana has to be decriminalized in this country. Ricky Williams was successful while he smoked pot, he was not causing problems in the locker room, he was not causing problems with his teammates, and always ran hard. Now he is not allowed to play because he smokes a plant that recent studies have shown is not nearly as harmful as once thought. In fact, smoking marijuana is less dangerous than drinking because it is not physically addicting, and it is impossible to overdose on marijuana. The long term health risks are far less severe with marijuana as opposed to alcohol as well. Marijuana does not have a negative effect on Ricky Williams life, the team he plays for, or the NFL. The only problem here is caused by the league and that's wrong.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 Dirk Nowitzki, who led the to a 67-victory season but failed to lead them out of the first round of the playoffs, will be named the N.B.A.s most valuable player next week, two team officials confirmed. Skip to next paragraph Dallas, led by Dirk Nowitzki, won 67 regular-season games but faltered in the first round. The team officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the league had not made the formal announcement, which is expected Tuesday. Nowitzkis selection as the leagues first European-born M.V.P. was first reported by Nowitzki, a native of Germany, averaged 24.6 points and 8.9 rebounds this season. He set career highs in field-goal percentage (.502), 3-point shooting (.416) and free-throw percentage (.904). The Mavericks finished with the leagues best record and tied for the sixth-most victories in N.B.A. history. Their sparkling season was followed by a colossal pratfall, when the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors knocked them out of the playoffs last week. Dallas was only the third No. 1 seed to lose to an eighth seed in the N.B.A. playoffs. Nowitzki absorbed much of the blame for the 4-2 defeat after averaging only 19.7 points and shooting 38.3 percent in the series. He will be the third M.V.P., and the first in 25 years, to lose in the first round. Moses Malones fell in the first round when he won the award in 1979 and in 1982. Wes Unseld won the award in 1969, when his Baltimore Bullets lost in the first round. I thought this was such an incredible year, Nowitzki told ESPN.com. We won 67 games, and then to lose in the first round, it just feels so empty right now. Balloting for the award is conducted in the final weeks of the regular season by 132 writers and broadcasters who cover the league. This will be the third consecutive year that the N.B.A. has given the award to a foreign-born player. The Phoenix Suns Steve Nash, of Canada, was named the M.V.P. in 2005 and 2006.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 Dirk Nowitzki, who led the to a 67-victory season but failed to lead them out of the first round of the playoffs, will be named the N.B.A.s most valuable player next week, two team officials confirmed. Skip to next paragraph Dallas, led by Dirk Nowitzki, won 67 regular-season games but faltered in the first round. The team officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the league had not made the formal announcement, which is expected Tuesday. Nowitzkis selection as the leagues first European-born M.V.P. was first reported by Nowitzki, a native of Germany, averaged 24.6 points and 8.9 rebounds this season. He set career highs in field-goal percentage (.502), 3-point shooting (.416) and free-throw percentage (.904). The Mavericks finished with the leagues best record and tied for the sixth-most victories in N.B.A. history. Their sparkling season was followed by a colossal pratfall, when the eighth-seeded Golden State Warriors knocked them out of the playoffs last week. Dallas was only the third No. 1 seed to lose to an eighth seed in the N.B.A. playoffs. Nowitzki absorbed much of the blame for the 4-2 defeat after averaging only 19.7 points and shooting 38.3 percent in the series. He will be the third M.V.P., and the first in 25 years, to lose in the first round. Moses Malones fell in the first round when he won the award in 1979 and in 1982. Wes Unseld won the award in 1969, when his Baltimore Bullets lost in the first round. I thought this was such an incredible year, Nowitzki told ESPN.com. We won 67 games, and then to lose in the first round, it just feels so empty right now. Balloting for the award is conducted in the final weeks of the regular season by 132 writers and broadcasters who cover the league. This will be the third consecutive year that the N.B.A. has given the award to a foreign-born player. The Phoenix Suns Steve Nash, of Canada, was named the M.V.P. in 2005 and 2006.

Landis, who has waged a continuous battle to clear his name since testing positive for too high testosterone levels after last year's Tour, said in a telephone press conference from Los Angeles on Thursday that USADA contacted his lawyers soon after reports emerged that he tested positive. He said they offered him "the shortest suspension they'd ever given an athlete" if he could provide information against Armstrong. "It was offensive at best. It speaks to the character of the prosecution and I will not give an answer to something like that," Landis said. Landis will face a hearing about his positive doping result on Monday in Malibu. He faces a two-year ban. USADA recently ordered an examination of seven tests with new methods and they returned a positive result. Landis was Armstrong's US-Postal teammate from 2002 till 2004.

It's 'the Buffalo way' Michael Traikos, National Post Published:Â Saturday, May 12, 2007 BUFFALO - Is it possible that a sports team enjoys adversity so much that it needs to have its back against the wall before coming together for a win? That is the feeling here, where the Sabres trail the Ottawa Senators 1-0 in the Eastern Conference final. Game 2 takes place at HSBC Arena tonight. "The Buffalo way" was how goaltender Ryan Miller explained his team's lacklustre performance in Thursday's 5-2 loss. Co-captain Daniel Briere agreed that the Sabres have a knack for painting themselves into a corner. Email to a friend "I guess that's us," Briere said. "We like to make it hard for some reason. I wish we could have come out flying and played well every game and win every series 4-0 or 4-1. But that's not the case." The Sabres had the best record in the National Hockey League's regular season, but they have struggled with consistency throughout the playoffs. A 3-2 loss in Game 2 against the Islanders proved to be a wake-up call for the Sabres in the opening round. Buffalo went on to win the remaining three games, but the team once again stumbled in the Eastern Conference semi-final. After winning the first two games against the Rangers at home, the Sabres lost the following two in New York. In Game 5, Buffalo came from behind to force overtime with 7.7 seconds left in the third period and then battled back from a first-period deficit in Game 6. Buffalo is hopeful that Thursday's loss, in which the Sabres committed 19 turnovers and gave up a short-handed breakaway goal, proves to be another example of the team overcoming adversity. "The Rangers series was up and down," Briere said. "We had some good games, some bad games, good games, bad games, so I'm hoping that we're due for a good game [tonight]." If the Sabres are to even the series, Buffalo will need a better performance from its special teams. The Sabres, who went 0-for-5 on the power play in Game 1, are a middling 9-for-64 during the playoffs. That translates into a 14.1% success rate. Buffalo was tied for 17th in the league with a 17.4% success rate during the regular season. "All we're trying to do is keep it simple," co-captain Chris Drury said of the power play, which actually resulted in a short-handed goal for Ottawa's Mike Fisher. "We're not trying to reinvent the wheel," he continued. "We know we're struggling a bit with it. One game can turn it around." The team's ability to prevent power-play goals is more of an epidemic. Buffalo, which went 4-for-6 on the penalty kill on Thursday, is 43-for-55 during the playoffs. Again, that is lower (78.2%) than the team's success rate during the regular season (81.4%), when the Sabres ranked 20th. On the other hand, the Senators have scored two shorthanded goals and have the second- best power play (24%) during the playoffs. "They played as aggressive all year, so we knew that it was coming," forward Thomas Vanek said of Ottawa's penalty-killing unit. "Like I said, we just had a mental breakdown." The Sabres' inconsistency and mistakes, said head coach Lindy Ruff, can be traced to inexperience. Aside from Drury, no Buffalo player has ever won a Stanley Cup, and 11 players have been in the playoffs only once before. "We're still pretty young," Ruff said. "We've got some players that are getting very valuable playoff experience. And in some situations, I think we haven't reacted with a lot of moxie."

When they went deep twice in as many pitches after going without a homer for eight games, they had to know it would be a good night. Andruw Jones and Jeff Francoeur homered in the sixth inning to help the Braves end their longest streak without a homer in 24 years, and manager Bobby Cox tied Sparky Anderson for fourth place in career victories with a 4-1 decision over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night. The Braves went 72 innings without a homer until Jones hit a two-run drive over the center field wall following Chipper Jones' double high off the wall in center, just a few feet below where Andruw Jones hit it out. Francoeur followed with a drive into the left-field seats for his sixth homer, the same number as Andruw Jones. ''I took us eight or nine days to hit a homer, but it counted huge,'' Cox said. The homer drought was the Braves' longest since a 13-game streak in 1983, but didn't hurt their record as they won their fourth in a row and fifth in six games. ''I didn't know that, but we've been winning, and that's the important thing,'' Cox said. Once again, the Braves put together a big inning with two outs. They lead the majors with 92 runs with two outs. ''It seems every night we start it with two outs, and I don't know why,'' Francoeur said. ''It's hard to explain, but it seems that when we get guys into scoring position with two outs, everybody tends to get locked in. And you want to ride it out.'' Cox has a simpler answer: ''When you have good hitters, it doesn't matter how many outs there are.'' Two innings before the four-run sixth, Chipper Jones tumbled over third baseman Jose Bautista as Bautista fielded a grounder, causing Jones to land hard on both wrists, his left knee and thigh. Jones lay on third base for several minutes, in obvious discomfort, but stayed in the game to Cox's relief. ''I thought I was going to have to take him out when I went out there,'' Cox said. The Pirates dropped their ninth in 13 games as Zach Duke (1-4) limited Atlanta to four hits and no runs until giving up about 1,200 feet worth of extra-base hits in a span of four pitches. After that, Brian McCann and Matt Diaz singled to chase Duke, and pinch-hitter Scott Thorman hit an RBI double off reliever Jonah Bayliss to make it 4-1. ''I thought I threw some pitches in decent spots,'' Duke said. ''Chipper hit a changeup down and Andruw Jones hit a sinker. You don't see that very often.'' He could have been referring to Cox's 2,194-1,698 record in 26 seasons with the Braves and Blue Jays. Cox got his 2,194th victory in his 3,895th game, counting three ties, while Anderson - the former Reds and Tigers manager - needed 4,030 games. The leader is Connie Mack (3,731), who managed for a record 53 seasons. ''I'm proud to be in his (Anderson's) class, I don't belong in it but I'll take it,'' Cox said. Kyle Davies (1-1) limited the Pirates to one run and seven hits over seven innings, even though the Pirates stayed with the mixed-up batting order manager Jim Tracy used Thursday in beating the Cubs 6-4. NL batting champion Freddy Sanchez led off again, Jason Bay hit third and Jack Wilson dropped to eighth, but the mixed-up order produced only a sacrifice fly in the fourth by former Braves first baseman Adam LaRoche. The Pirates sent reliever Mike Gonzalez to Atlanta for LaRoche during the offseason. ''My confidence is starting to get a little bit better and my pitching is a little bit better, and I think the two go hand in hand,'' said Davies, who hadn't won since beating Washington 6-1 on Sept. 18. Tyler Yates followed Davies with a scoreless eighth, and Gonzalez pitched the ninth for his second save in as many opportunities, getting LaRoche to ground into a double play. Gonzalez hasn't allowed a run in his past 14 appearances. ''I had to tone it down emotion-wise,'' Gonzalez said. ''It's very different, facing these guys.'' Notes: Atlanta is a season-high 11 games over .500 (23-12). ... Duke allowed as many runs in the sixth (four) as he did over 18 2-3 innings in his previous three starts. ... Edgar Renteria extended his hitting streak to 17 games with a two-out single in the ninth. He sat out the previous two games with flu-like symptoms. ... The Braves homered in 21 of their first 26 games. ... Cox has a 110-80 record vs. Pittsburgh. ... The Pirates have scored one or no runs in four of their past nine games.

When they went deep twice in as many pitches after going without a homer for eight games, they had to know it would be a good night. Andruw Jones and Jeff Francoeur homered in the sixth inning to help the Braves end their longest streak without a homer in 24 years, and manager Bobby Cox tied Sparky Anderson for fourth place in career victories with a 4-1 decision over the Pittsburgh Pirates on Friday night. The Braves went 72 innings without a homer until Jones hit a two-run drive over the center field wall following Chipper Jones' double high off the wall in center, just a few feet below where Andruw Jones hit it out. Francoeur followed with a drive into the left-field seats for his sixth homer, the same number as Andruw Jones. ''I took us eight or nine days to hit a homer, but it counted huge,'' Cox said. The homer drought was the Braves' longest since a 13-game streak in 1983, but didn't hurt their record as they won their fourth in a row and fifth in six games. ''I didn't know that, but we've been winning, and that's the important thing,'' Cox said. Once again, the Braves put together a big inning with two outs. They lead the majors with 92 runs with two outs. ''It seems every night we start it with two outs, and I don't know why,'' Francoeur said. ''It's hard to explain, but it seems that when we get guys into scoring position with two outs, everybody tends to get locked in. And you want to ride it out.''

Two innings before the four-run sixth, Chipper Jones tumbled over third baseman Jose Bautista as Bautista fielded a grounder, causing Jones to land hard on both wrists, his left knee and thigh. Jones lay on third base for several minutes, in obvious discomfort, but stayed in the game to Cox's relief. ''I thought I was going to have to take him out when I went out there,'' Cox said.

They returned home to signs of "Play Bald!" on the videoboards inside and outside the ballpark. "We didn't get any prettier, but we're playing pretty good baseball since this happened," Wright said. "Hopefully the streak continues." New York (22-12) stopped a six-game winning streak for Milwaukee, the hottest team in the major leagues. (2-0) won his second straight start since coming back from the minors and beat (5-3), who pitched at Shea Stadium for the first time since helping the win Game 7 of last year's NL championship series. The Mets took a 4-0 lead in the fourth and won for the seventh time in nine games, defeating a club that came to town with a big league-best 24-10 record and 10 wins in 11 games. "If I'm around the house and they're on TV, I'll definitely stop and watch them," Wright said. "They play with energy. They remind us a lot of ourselves. They go out there. They have fun. They smile.

And he entered having won his five previous starts. He didn't allow any hits in the first three innings, then gave up six in the fourth -- the first six-hit inning off Suppan since Aug. 23, 2002, for Kansas City at Minnesota, according to the Elias Sports Bureau. Suppan started six of his first eight batters in the inning with balls. He didn't give up a hit in any of his other five innings. "Some pitches were up in the zone and in the middle of the plate," he said. "In that fourth inning, I wasn't able to locate the way I wanted." Wright led off the fourth with a home run into the left-field bleachers, beat out an infield single to first and Delgado homered to left -- he's homered in two straight games after hitting one in New York's first 32. "For the last week or so I've been feeling better at the plate," Delgado said. "Every time I'm able stay back and drive the ball to the opposite field, it's a good sign." doubled off the center-field wall and scored on 's one-out single. Suppan escaped further trouble when he retired on an inning-ending flyout with runners on second and third.

Ottawa Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson listens as head coach Bryan Murray points out a play at practice. Buffalo's power play under siege More articles by this columnist In the usual thrust and parry of playoff hockey, the Ottawa Senators say they'll have to make adjustments to counter the Buffalo Sabres' adjustments. But you can be certain that there's one thing the Senators will not change tonight. On at least the first couple of Buffalo power plays, the Ottawa forwards will charge the Sabre point men like cheap lawyers chasing an ambulance. When sharks smell blood, they don't wait for the wound to heal. And the fleet front men of the Senators' man-short unit love to close in for the kill. They did it with regularity in Thursday's series opener, getting a couple of short-handed breakaways by pressing the point, and converting one (Mike Fisher) into a goal. Some of those turnovers, the Sabres, bemoaned came off panic plays as the penalty killing Sens closed in on the blue line. Lindy Ruff conceded in the aftermath that flaccid failure on the first couple of power play attempts "just snowballed." They went oh-fer in five attempts. The Sabres should not have been shocked by this tactic. It's in all the films. Except for one game, the Senators neutered the Jersey power play, mostly at the point. And since the Penguins scored twice with an extra man in each of the first two playoff games, Ottawa has allowed just four goals in 42 short-handed situations. So, on average, you need at least 10 Senator penalties to score one against them. And that stinginess originates mostly with forcing the play on the defensive blue line. "I think we feel we can put a lot of pressure on them because we have a lot of guys who skate well on the penalty killing," says Daniel Alfredsson, one of six Senators forwards who draw regular short-handed assignments. "If we feel we can make that press and be successful, we'll go for it, and they have to make sure they make good plays. They've got some forwards on the blue line as well. It worked well, but I'm sure they're going to make adjustments and we're going to have to get better as well." Yes, but the adjustments won't include settling back into a static box. Forcing the points has become a common tactic in the NHL, especially in warm weather, when pucks don't move as quickly nor as smoothly. But it's somewhat of a gamble. If one or, as sometimes in Ottawa's case, two forwards are that high up, there's a lot of empty ice down low, and three forwards on two defencemen. The Sabres have excellent passers and skaters and should be able to take advantage of that extra acreage. But since a strong February, their power play hasn't been clicking with the same confidence and blurring speed that their even-strength units have. By the end of the season they ranked only 20th in the NHL. Yesterday and today -- and the last few weeks -- the worried burghers of Buffalo have often spoken of the Sabres' power play as if it's already shuffled off this mortal coil, never again to join the land of the living. That's a little extreme. But fans of both teams could never be accused of keeping an even keel. They're faithful in their long-term support, but a trifle manic-depressive in their day-to-day conduct. But there's reason for concern here. Buffalo has rallied from two-goal deficits often this year, and did it again Thursday. But comebacks often need power play goals as springboards. The Sabres' power play seems disorganized and is now 2-for-24 since scoring twice in the first game of the Ranger series, and is facing a penalty kill with wings on its feet and its spirit. "The key for us is using our legs," says Fisher, who has two pretty quick ones. "The less time you give them with the puck on the power play, the better. It doesn't matter how skilled you are, and they're skilled, it's tough to make the plays you want when you're pressed. "Yes, there's always something open if you make the right play on the power play. The key for us is to shut everything down and not let them have too much time. "Those guys are skilled and they like to make good plays. They like the plays from behind the net, and quick shots. (Chris) Phillips and (Anton) Volchenkov have been unbelievable. They're the anchor really, they jump on pucks, block shots, they're the best two in the league at doing that. Ray (Emery) is pretty calm and he's been good on the penalty kill." But as solid as those Ottawa defencemen and goalie Emery have been, the challenge for Buffalo is still to get the puck off the blue line more quickly and force the Senators to be a little less lively at the top of their penalty-killing box. Conversely, the Senators will try to come hard at the points, especially early, because another opening flurry of blocked shots, chips off the boards, and breakaways can take the starch out of a power play and set it on its heels for the rest of the game. "Could be," Alfredsson says coyly. "We talked about that a little bit, watching them play the Rangers. We know they try to put pressure on, try to force things "We knew if we moved the puck, catch them once or twice early, naturally they're going to have to back off, protect the middle a little bit. Make them think." They're thinking, Alfie, they're thinking. Contents copyright 1991-2006, The Hamilton Spectator. All rights reserved.

Ottawa Senators captain Daniel Alfredsson listens as head coach Bryan Murray points out a play at practice. Buffalo's power play under siege More articles by this columnist In the usual thrust and parry of playoff hockey, the Ottawa Senators say they'll have to make adjustments to counter the Buffalo Sabres' adjustments. But you can be certain that there's one thing the Senators will not change tonight. On at least the first couple of Buffalo power plays, the Ottawa forwards will charge the Sabre point men like cheap lawyers chasing an ambulance.

He has been fighting the allegations ever since. Tour de France champion Floyd Landis wants his upcoming doping hearing to be a spectacle filled with big-time surprises and unseemly revelations, one that shines a harsh light on the anti-doping movement and ultimately clears him of wrongdoing. Those prosecuting him are hoping for business as usual â a dry, detailed accounting of the science that led to Landis being accused of using banned synthetic testosterone during the Tour. The public arbitration hearing starts Monday, and the stakes are higher than just the possible two-year ban Landis could face if he loses. He would be the first rider in the Tourâs 104-year history to be stripped of the title, and he says heâll retire if he loses and canât get the result overturned in appeals. But the 31-year-old cyclist doesnât think heâs going to lose. And he wants to use the 10-day hearing to deliver a knockout to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, the group underwritten by the federal government and the U.S. Olympic Committee that Landis claims is fundamentally corrupt. âIf they lose this, they cease to exist. I donât see any other way,â Landis said. âIt would be no point in them going on. âTheyâve made such bold statements about how sure they are that this is the truth that there would be no point in ever accusing anyone again after I demonstrate that Iâm innocent.â Despite a positive test for elevated levels of testosterone to epitestosterone after his stirring comeback victory in Stage 17 of last yearâs Tour, Landis insists he never has used performance-enhancing drugs. About 20 percent of the cases that have begun with an âadverseâ drug test have been thrown out early in the process because of lack of evidence. But USADA does not lose cases when they reach the arbitration stage. Since being founded by the USOC in 2000, USADA has tried 34 cases in front of a panel of three arbitrators much like the one that will preside over Landisâ hearing at Pepperdine University in Malibu, Calif. American Landis wins cycling showcase, which witnessed plenty of heroics, crashes and a drug scandal that rocked the race even before it began. âIâve often said I wish the public could be a fly on the wall to see how fairly the process was conceived,â said Dr. Gary Wadler, a member of the World Anti-Doping Association who also has served as an arbitrator. âThe athletes came in with the experts, articulating where they thought the system was in error. They made their case and then the arbitrators heard evidence of both sides and came to what we believed to be a fair conclusion based on facts.â In the past, hearings had been closed to the public in part to protect athletes from embarrassing revelations. But at Landisâ request, this hearing will be public. Landis wants to use the hearing to expose what he says is the fraudulent way the anti-doping people do business. âThe fact is that the people doing the testing, the people accusing the athletes, are far more unethical than the athletes,â Landis said. ALSO ON THIS STORY Landis: USADA wanted to rat out Armstrong French anti-doping official fears backlash Discuss: Sound off on sports message boards Landis hired Howard Jacobs, a well-known defense lawyer for athletes fighting doping charges who once accused USADA of using âMcCarthy-like tacticsâ to nab athletes. Landis also brought on attorney Maurice Suh, a specialist in government-fraud cases. Suhâs presence speaks to Landisâ basic strategy â attack the process as much as the science. Some skeptics say going after the process is the typical way accused athletes try to get by on a technicality. Jacobs insists itâs not that simple. âItâs a very complicated test, a very technical test,â Jacobs said. âIf you point to five things, for example, that they did wrong in actually analyzing the sample and arbitrators rule that those five things mean the results are unreliable â some might say itâs a technicality.

In the dugout at Safeco Field on Friday, Torre was asked about Jarrod Washburn, the starter for the Skip to next paragraph Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images Kenji Johjima followed a leadoff walk to Adri&#225;n Beltre in the fourth inning with a two-run homer against Yankees starter Darrell Rasner, giving the Mariners a 3-0 lead. Keep up with the latest news on the on The Timess baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » Times Topics: The Yankees Times Topics: The Mets  manager, offered a standard compliment for a pitcher who finds a way to succeed without throwing hard: Hes got a belly full of guts. Torre has seen enough of Washburn to make that evaluation, and he may be wistful for pitchers like him. Washburn is a veteran with know-how, and the Yankees started a rookie for the 17th time in 34 games. Darrell Rasner was decent, but Washburn was much better in a 3-0 victory for the Mariners. He certainly didnt miss his spots very often; you could see that by how many bats he broke and how many good counts he was pitching in, Torre said. But we didnt have a lot of good at-bats either. You certainly have to give him credit, but were just going to have to start swinging the bats better. Washburn allowed six hits and a walk over eight innings, striking out six to silence the Yankees as they start a rough patch of their schedule. Starting Friday, the Yankees will play 19 of 25 games away from Yankee Stadium, including series at Shea Stadium and Fenway Park. The Mariners are among the lighter opponents on the schedule, but their record is better than the Yankees, who are 16-18. Seattle is 16-15, but 16-9 in games not started by Jeff Weaver, who landed on the disabled list Friday with shoulder tendinitis. Washburn, like Weaver, came to the Mariners from the agent Scott Boras, who was in town on Friday and chatted with his biggest client, the Yankees Alex Rodriguez, during batting practice. Rodriguez managed an infield single in four at-bats against Washburn and said later he had no idea why he pitched so well. It was obvious he was on his A game, Rodriguez said, and we just couldnt get anything going. Last season was a struggle at times for Washburn, who went 8-14 with a 4.67 earned run average. But with an 88-mile-an-hour fastball and a nifty assortment of breaking balls, he limited the Yankees to singles and never let a runner advance past second base. He is 3-3 with a 2.64 E.R.A. They have a good lineup, but you cant get caught up in the Yankee mystique, Washburn said. You know what a challenge it is, but I find that challenge fun. Last Sunday in New York, Rasner held the Mariners scoreless over five and two thirds innings in a 5-0 Yankees victory. The Yankees had planned to return him to the minors after the game, but because of that effort, and the spotty performances of Kei Igawa, it was Igawa who was demoted. After a series with the Texas Rangers, the Yankees came here to face the Mariners again, meaning Rasner would see a familiar opponent. That was not ideal, but Rasner mostly held his own. He allowed at least one hit in all five innings he pitched, but only three hits hurt. The first was a double by Ichiro Suzuki that bounced hard over first baseman Josh Phelpss glove in the third inning. Suzuki scored on a two-out single by Raul Ibañez, whose liner bounced just under Phelpss glove and into right field. In the fourth, Rasner walked the leadoff man, Adrian Beltre, and Kenji Johjima followed with a liner over the hand-operated scoreboard down the left-field line. It was 3-0 Mariners, and the lead seemed plenty big enough for Washburn. Rasner said the pitch to Johjima was supposed to be a fastball down and away, but he left it over the middle. I made a mistake, and he did exactly what he was supposed to do with it, Rasner said. Before signing with Seattle after the 2005 season, Washburn spent eight years with the Angels, the team that most frustrates the Torre Yankees. In nine regular-season starts against the Yankees before Friday night, Washburn had never allowed more than three earned runs. This would be Washburns best game ever against the Yankees  the most innings he has thrown against them, and the fewest runs he has allowed. The Yankees, who have had just one eight-inning outing by a pitcher all season, flailed hopelessly at his pitches and probably, deep down, regarded him with envy. According to Joe Torre, will throw in the bullpen at the Yankees complex in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday, with his first minor league game scheduled for Thursday, Friday or Saturday. ... Jason Giambi, who has a bone spur in his left heel, took batting practice but was scratched from the lineup. Giambi is having orthotics made for his shoe, but until they arrive, the foot is being specially taped. He said he was considering a cortisone shot in the foot but plans to play on Saturday. ... General Manager said that the Yankees were compiling written reports from the four doctors who have examined Carl Pavanos elbow. Cashman said that Pavano had no more doctors appointments scheduled and had returned to New York. Well go over the written evaluations with Carl when the team comes off the road trip, Cashman said. I still am not in position to talk about the findings yet. Pavano said that one doctor had told him he had a tear in his elbow and would need reconstructive surgery. ... Torre talked to the struggling reliever Luis Vizcaíno on the team flight to Seattle and was relieved to learn Vizcaíno was not hurt. But his position seems perilous, especially with Ron Villone pitching well at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Villone can become a free agent if the Yankees do not promote him by Tuesday. We need to get Vizcaíno going, Cashman said. Hes struggled for a while, and we need to get him on line. ... Some hitters will use pink bats on Sunday for Mothers Day, as they did last season, to raise money for breast cancer research.

In the dugout at Safeco Field on Friday, Torre was asked about Jarrod Washburn, the starter for the Skip to next paragraph Otto Greule Jr./Getty Images Kenji Johjima followed a leadoff walk to Adri&#225;n Beltre in the fourth inning with a two-run homer against Yankees starter Darrell Rasner, giving the Mariners a 3-0 lead. Keep up with the latest news on the on The Timess baseball blog. Go to the Bats Blog » Times Topics: The Yankees Times Topics: The Mets  manager, offered a standard compliment for a pitcher who finds a way to succeed without throwing hard: Hes got a belly full of guts. Torre has seen enough of Washburn to make that evaluation, and he may be wistful for pitchers like him. Washburn is a veteran with know-how, and the Yankees started a rookie for the 17th time in 34 games. Darrell Rasner was decent, but Washburn was much better in a 3-0 victory for the Mariners. He certainly didnt miss his spots very often; you could see that by how many bats he broke and how many good counts he was pitching in, Torre said. But we didnt have a lot of good at-bats either. You certainly have to give him credit, but were just going to have to start swinging the bats better. Washburn allowed six hits and a walk over eight innings, striking out six to silence the Yankees as they start a rough patch of their schedule. Starting Friday, the Yankees will play 19 of 25 games away from Yankee Stadium, including series at Shea Stadium and Fenway Park. The Mariners are among the lighter opponents on the schedule, but their record is better than the Yankees, who are 16-18. Seattle is 16-15, but 16-9 in games not started by Jeff Weaver, who landed on the disabled list Friday with shoulder tendinitis. Washburn, like Weaver, came to the Mariners from the agent Scott Boras, who was in town on Friday and chatted with his biggest client, the Yankees Alex Rodriguez, during batting practice. Rodriguez managed an infield single in four at-bats against Washburn and said later he had no idea why he pitched so well. It was obvious he was on his A game, Rodriguez said, and we just couldnt get anything going. Last season was a struggle at times for Washburn, who went 8-14 with a 4.67 earned run average. But with an 88-mile-an-hour fastball and a nifty assortment of breaking balls, he limited the Yankees to singles and never let a runner advance past second base. He is 3-3 with a 2.64 E.R.A. They have a good lineup, but you cant get caught up in the Yankee mystique, Washburn said. You know what a challenge it is, but I find that challenge fun. Last Sunday in New York, Rasner held the Mariners scoreless over five and two thirds innings in a 5-0 Yankees victory. The Yankees had planned to return him to the minors after the game, but because of that effort, and the spotty performances of Kei Igawa, it was Igawa who was demoted. After a series with the Texas Rangers, the Yankees came here to face the Mariners again, meaning Rasner would see a familiar opponent. That was not ideal, but Rasner mostly held his own. He allowed at least one hit in all five innings he pitched, but only three hits hurt. The first was a double by Ichiro Suzuki that bounced hard over first baseman Josh Phelpss glove in the third inning. Suzuki scored on a two-out single by Raul Ibañez, whose liner bounced just under Phelpss glove and into right field. In the fourth, Rasner walked the leadoff man, Adrian Beltre, and Kenji Johjima followed with a liner over the hand-operated scoreboard down the left-field line. It was 3-0 Mariners, and the lead seemed plenty big enough for Washburn. Rasner said the pitch to Johjima was supposed to be a fastball down and away, but he left it over the middle. I made a mistake, and he did exactly what he was supposed to do with it, Rasner said. Before signing with Seattle after the 2005 season, Washburn spent eight years with the Angels, the team that most frustrates the Torre Yankees. In nine regular-season starts against the Yankees before Friday night, Washburn had never allowed more than three earned runs. This would be Washburns best game ever against the Yankees  the most innings he has thrown against them, and the fewest runs he has allowed. The Yankees, who have had just one eight-inning outing by a pitcher all season, flailed hopelessly at his pitches and probably, deep down, regarded him with envy. According to Joe Torre, will throw in the bullpen at the Yankees complex in Tampa, Fla., on Tuesday, with his first minor league game scheduled for Thursday, Friday or Saturday. ... Jason Giambi, who has a bone spur in his left heel, took batting practice but was scratched from the lineup. Giambi is having orthotics made for his shoe, but until they arrive, the foot is being specially taped. He said he was considering a cortisone shot in the foot but plans to play on Saturday. ... General Manager said that the Yankees were compiling written reports from the four doctors who have examined Carl Pavanos elbow. Cashman said that Pavano had no more doctors appointments scheduled and had returned to New York. Well go over the written evaluations with Carl when the team comes off the road trip, Cashman said. I still am not in position to talk about the findings yet. Pavano said that one doctor had told him he had a tear in his elbow and would need reconstructive surgery. ... Torre talked to the struggling reliever Luis Vizcaíno on the team flight to Seattle and was relieved to learn Vizcaíno was not hurt. But his position seems perilous, especially with Ron Villone pitching well at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Villone can become a free agent if the Yankees do not promote him by Tuesday. We need to get Vizcaíno going, Cashman said. Hes struggled for a while, and we need to get him on line. ... Some hitters will use pink bats on Sunday for Mothers Day, as they did last season, to raise money for breast cancer research. Reliever Mike Myers is not a hitter, but he had his glove company, Akadema, make him a pink glove to use Sunday. Myers said that he planned to have teammates autograph the glove and then auction it for charity. I got a blue one for Fathers Day, too, Myers said.

Well, some answers, anyway. Dale Earnhardt Jr. is leaving Dale Earnhardt Incorporated for greener pastures because he hopes it will lead to a championship and even more money for NASCAR's most popular driver. I must admit, the decision surprised me, and I'm guessing it surprised you, too. I thought Dale Jr. would get what he wanted from the company his father started, because he was DEI. No offense to Martin Truex Jr. and Paul Menard or any other potential driver, but nobody is replacing Dale Jr. Junior would not say in his press conference what caused the split with DEI, but bank on this: It came down to the percentage of dollars for Dale Jr., not the upgrades to equipment and technology that would help DEI compete with Hendrick Motorsports, Richard Childress Racing, Roush-Fenway Racing and Joe Gibbs Racing. Dale Jr. was going to make a lot of money whether he stayed at DEI or left on his own, but apparently his idea of majority control was a little too much for his stepmother Teresa to give up. So perhaps I should give him credit for walking away from more money and control. Or maybe he was walking away from the financial nightmare of running a multi-car Nextel Cup operation that was clearly lagging behind the other major teams. So if you can't beat 'em or truly compete with 'em, and you can't outspend 'em, what do you do? Join 'em! The question now is which team Dale Jr. will join. All the speculation since Dale Jr. called a press conference Wednesday night has centered on Richard Childress Racing or Hendrick Motorsports. Based on what I have seen and heard on the radio, in other columns and from people more in the know than me, the feeling is that RCR would be first in line, followed by Hendrick and then by a couple of long shots. I don't think it's that clear-cut. I think one of those long shots has an excellent shot and has all the makings of a potential superteam. Sure, RCR has Daytona 500 champion Kevin Harvick, the rejuvenated Jeff Burton and a star on the rise in Clint Bowyer to help ease Junior's transition. And, of course, RCR is where his father drove the famous No. 3, which could be dusted off for a driver of Dale Jr.'s stature. Hendrick Motorsports has everything: Jimmie Johnson, Jeff Gordon, Kyle Busch and Casey Mears on a new contract. They have the technology, the engine expertise and the COT success every team is looking for. But they also have four drivers, which is the most you are allowed under the new rules (excepting the provision for Roush-Fenway). So unless Mears is getting fired sometime soon, don't look for Junior to be heading to Hendrick. While those two teams make some sense for Dale Jr. -- especially RCR -- I have a feeling he will choose to work for the coach of his favorite NFL team, the Washington Redskins. Joe Gibbs might be a quasi-absentee owner while he focuses on righting the Redskins' ship, but make no mistake: the stars could align for an Earnhardt-Gibbs relationship. First, there is a huge connection with Chevrolet. Junior is loyal to Chevy, and so is Joe Gibbs Racing. Tony Stewart, Denny Hamlin and to a lesser degree J.J. Yeley would make ideal teammates, especially the first two, who are extremely successful in their own right. Could you imagine the JGR triplets vs. the Hendrick triplets? It would be Red Sox-Yankees (without as much bitterness) every week. Joe Gibbs won't be coaching the Redskins much longer, so eventually Junior will be able to work with the NFL and NASCAR icon more closely, and there has been speculation that JGR would like to take the next step to fill out its racing family. Last October, I asked Dale Jr. about this possibility when we were talking about the Redskins' overtime victory over the Jaguars. He laughed nervously, and while he didn't exactly tip his hand, he basically admitted it was something he would be willing to consider. That was last October. What do you think he is thinking about now? One last point: In a sport that markets everything from soup to nuts, could you imagine if Daniel Snyder, the Redskins' owner, could get his paws on Junior in some sort of marketing deal involving the Redskins, JGR and Junior? Think of the possibilties. Why shouldn't JGR be a front-runner in the chase for the most coveted free-agent in NASCAR history? They have a better chance than Hendrick, they have the open spot that Roush-Fenway does not, and unlike RCR, they don't have the ghost of Dale Sr. looming above. Seems like a perfect match to me. What about you? SPEAK OUT ON THIS ARTICLE Comments on this article Add your own comment to this article on Fri May 11, 2007 01:10 pm I would love to see Jr drive with JGR, but Gibbs will put his Christian faith and values before accepting Budwieser as a sponsor.

I was dead set on Jr going to Hendrix or RCR but your point makes sense. Hail to the Redskins and Jr too. Rate or reply to this comment on Fri May 11, 2007 03:08 pm They don't pay the sponsership bills. I think Gibbs would bend a little bit for Jr, after all he does have Tony Stewart as a driver.

Rate or reply to this comment on Sat May 12, 2007 12:06 am Russell, Joe Gibbs won't use tobacco or alcohol sponors, and Dale Jr isn't going to tell Bud to take a hike.

Rate or reply to this comment on Sat May 12, 2007 07:43 am Everything lines up as this being a perfect fit except for that Bud sponsorship, and Bud is going to go with Dale Jr. and he will take them with him. Jr. also has a good track record with Stewart when the two of them have teamed up together on the track. I still don't think it will happen and I have a feeling that Hendrick or RCR would find a way to get Jr. There has been some talk on this website throughout the week about Hendrick being a "dynasty" of a "team" if Nascar ever saw one. Can you imagine the dynasty they'd be investing in, and building, if they added Jr. to the team? I do like the idea of there being a team vs. team battle like the Sox vs. Yankess, but it is going to take a lot for this to happen.

(CP / Adrian Wyld) Former Argo Williams tests positive for marijuana Updated Fri. May. 11 2007 3:03 PM ET -- Ricky Williams, who spent last season in the CFL while serving an NFL drug suspension, has tested positive again for marijuana, according to a source. A person familiar with the case said the former NFL rushing champion tested positive last month. Williams had applied to the NFL for reinstatement in April but following the latest positive drug test, clinicians in the program advised league commissioner Roger Goodell to delay reinstatement, the source said. Both the NFL and Dolphins declined comment. Leigh Steinberg, Williams' agent, did not immediately return a telephone message. Williams spent the 2006 season with the Toronto Argonauts, rushing for 526 yards on 109 carries but missed two months with a broken arm and Achilles tendon injury. But on Friday in Toronto, Argos president Keith Pelley said if Williams has indeed tested positive, he won't be able to find refuge in the CFL this season. Pelley said in the off-season the CFL's board of governors passed a code of conduct policy preventing its teams from signing players under suspension by other leagues, including the NFL. "I can definitively say Ricky Williams will not be in the CFL this season,'' Pelley said. Williams, who turns 30 on May 21, was suspended in April 2006 by the NFL after violating the league's drug policy for the fourth time. Last month, Steinberg quoted Williams as saying his interest in eastern philosophy had overcome his desire for mind-altering substances. Williams won the 1998 Heisman Trophy at Texas and the 2002 NFL rushing championship with the Dolphins, but has played only 12 games since 2003.

Pierre Bordry said independent experts had reviewed the lab&#039;s procedures and upheld the results of Landis&#039; failed test in July 2006. "It is not false to say that the experts concluded that the analysis was irreproachable," Bordry told The Associated Press in a telephone interview. Landis tested positive for elevated levels of testosterone to epitestosterone in a sample taken after he won the 17th stage of the 2006 Tour. The American has blamed his failed test on errors at the Chatenay-Malabry lab outside of Paris. Bordry appointed the three experts. Formula One: A rookie shows depth of his talent Tennis: Mauresmo is beaten at German Open Baseball: Milwaukee develops a taste for winning Landis has challenged the results, and a separate arbitration hearing begins Monday in California. If this hearing upholds the validity of the results, Landis would be the first rider to be stripped of the title in the Tour&#039;s 104-year history, and suspended from cycling for up to two years. Bordry said the experts&#039; report "responds to all of the arguments put forth by Landis&#039; lawyers." Bordry said he gave the report to Landis&#039; lawyers last week but the cyclist refused to pass it on to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, or USADA. Bordry said he gave the report to USADA on Friday. A report in Friday&#039;s Le Monde quoted the report as saying "the totality of our verifications show the laboratory ... worked in a professional manner."

In Time of Need O's cool off Red Sox By Bob Stern, Enterprise staff writer BOSTON  If the Red Sox rotation were the Three Stooges, Julian Tavarez would be Shemp. If the Sox rotation were the Marx Brothers, he'd be Gummo. He's part of the group, all right, but then again not quite part of it. He's there in name only. While the other four starters have been nothing short of sensational this year, Tavarez looks more and more like the guy keeping the seat warm for Jon Lester. The other four Red Sox starters  Curt Schilling, Josh Beckett, Daisuke Matsuzaka and Tim Wakefield  have an ERA of 3.09. Tavarez's is 6.60. The other four starters are a combined 19-6. Tavarez is 1-4. The other four starters average 6.56 innings per start. Tavarez averages 5.0. The other four starters sport a WHIP of 1.14. Tavarez's is 1.57. There's little doubt Tavarez is a long reliever in starter's clothing. And Friday night's performance in a 6-3 loss to the Orioles did little to dispute that. In five less-than-sparkling innings, Tavarez allowed five runs (four earned) on 11 hits. Seven of those hits came with two outs. &#8220;I wish I could pitch tomorrow,&#8221; said Tavarez. &#8220;When you don't do good, you can't wait until the next time you pitch, get some guys out and make yourself feel better. &#8220;For me, it's kind of tough to sleep after the game. If we lost, I just can eat, especially if I pitch. Hopefully, the time will go fast when I can get the ball again. I wish tomorrow was my fifth day so I can pitch again.&#8221; You could tell from the beginning Tavarez would have a rough night. In the first inning, he gave up a one-out double to Nick Markakis, but the Orioles' right fielder was still standing at second with two outs. Then the Orioes got three hits in succession  a double by Ramon Hernandez and singles by Aubrey Huff and Melvin Mora  to score the first two runs of the game. In the second, Tavarez got lucky. A couple of sensational fielding plays, one by Kevin Youkilis at first base and the other by Dustin Pedroia at second to end the inning, kept the Orioles off the scoreboard. Nevertheless, they threatened with a pair of two-out singles. Things finally came to a head in the fifth inning. With the score tied, 2-2, Markakis and Miguel Tejada led off the inning with singles, and Markakis scored on Hernandez's groundout. But the two-out problem reared its ugly head again as, after Huff grounded out, Melvin Mora doubled over Wily Mo Pena's head in right field to score Hernandez. Mora then scored when Jay Gibbons' short fly ball to right field tipped off Pena's glove for an error. &#8220;I just had a couple of bad innings out there,&#8221; said Tavarez. &#8220;In the fifth, things kind of flied away. I don't think I made a bad pitch in the fifth inning. It's just a little this and this. &#8220;I lost the game in two innings. How you win this game is to win an inning. How you pitch every inning, that's how you get the win.&#8221; And that was it. Tavarez never came out for the sixth inning  the fourth time in six starts he's failed to pitch more than five innings (he's yet to pitch more than six in any start), and the Sox fell to 2-4 in his starts. In those five innings, Tavarez gave up hits in four of them (he retired the side in order in only the fourth) and threw 90 pitches, 67 for strikes. &#8220;He wasn't tired,&#8221; said Red Sox manager Terry Francona. &#8220;He could have gone back out, but at that point he'd given up enough runs, enough hits  it was probably time to go to the bullpen.&#8221; With another key hit or two by the Red Sox, though, Tavarez might not have taken his fourth loss. The Sox left 13 men on base in the game, including the bases loaded in the first, second and seventh innings and two men on in the fourth. After spotting the Orioles two runs in the first, the Sox loaded the bases in the bottom of the inning on a walk and two singles, but Mike Lowell struck out to end the threat. The Sox tied the game in the second, but could have had a lot more. Julio Lugo's double and Manny Ramirez's bases-loaded walk pushed across two runs, but Youkilis flied to center to leave them loaded. In the seventh, the Sox scored a run on a bases-loaded walk to Jason Varitek, but Tejada made a sensational leaping catch at shortstop on a line drive hit by J.D. Drew for the second out and Alex Cora flied to center to end the threat. &#8220;We finally get an opportunity, and J.D. took one of the prettiest swings you'll ever see,&#8221; said Francona. &#8220;If that ball gets past Tejada, it probably goes all the way to the wall. On a night when we needed one hit, we couldn't get it.&#8221; The Orioles' final run came in the eighth when Kevin Millar's sacrifice fly scored Mora. Give us your opinion on this story.

Still, after Washington beat the Florida Marlins 6-0 Friday night, the rookie manager sighed and crossed his arms as he contemplated how it seems that even when things go right for his club, something goes wrong. ''Yeah,'' Acta said. ''It's a sour taste.'' If he seemed a bit sombre, and the home clubhouse was quiet despite a rare victory, it's because , Washington's most effective starter this season and Georgetown, Ont., native, said he's ''99 per cent sure'' he'll go on the disabled list with a sore right elbow that forced him out of the game after five no-hit innings. ''If he's out a while, it's definitely going to hurt,'' said , who drove in two runs and had one of Washington's 15 hits. ''He's been great so far.'' Hill (3-3, 2.70 ERA) walked two and retired the other 15 batters he faced. He took the mound to start the sixth but left without throwing another pitch. There also was bad news before the game for a team that entered the day a majors-worst 9-25: Nationals hitting coach Mitchell Page is taking a leave of absence for what the team called ''undisclosed personal reasons.'' Hill, who had elbow ligament replacement surgery in 2004 and missed all of 2005, will have an MRI exam on Monday and probably will be shut down for a week to 10 days, team doctor Ben Shaffer said. Hill's elbow began to bother him during his previous start, and he and Shaffer believe the problem stems from trying to compensate for a bothersome left shoulder that he jammed while running the bases last month. ''My mechanics have been a little bit out of whack and putting stress on the elbow,'' Hill said. His baseball career has been marked by various injuries - all the way back to when he played his first youth season wearing a cast on a broken leg. After returning to the majors in 2006 from the elbow surgery, Hill made six starts before the elbow acted up in June. Then, this season he's been bothered by right forearm stiffness and the left shoulder. He said he wasn't thinking about the no-hitter when he had to leave the mound.

(AP) -Jack Cust is the latest in a series of fill-ins who have become part of Oakland's recent success. Cust drove in four runs to help the Athletics beat C.C. Sabathia and the Cleveland Indians 8-2 Friday night. Oakland acquired Cust from the San Diego Padres on May 3 and promoted him from Triple-A Sacramento when Mike Piazza went on the disabled list last Friday. He is hitting .316 (6-for-19) with four homers and nine RBIs in five games with the A's. ''I've seen him since 1999 and I've always respected the way he swings the bat,'' A's manager Bob Geren said. ''The offense was sputtering early a bit but now the power numbers are coming.'' Cust hit a tiebreaking two-run homer off Sabathia in the seventh and a two-run single off Roberto Hernandez in the eighth. Cust, who went 2-for-4 against the Indians, homered twice in Oakland's 17-3 victory over Kansas City on Thursday. ''You put together pretty good numbers in the minors but sometimes you think scouts have seen you so much, they're not telling anyone,'' Cust said. ''I sat in Triple-A for seven years but (family) kept telling me to keep at it.'' Joe Blanton (4-1) took a shutout into the sixth inning, and won consecutive starts for the first time this season. ''My fastball and sinker have been my best pitches and I've been able to locate them,'' Blanton said. ''That's allowed me to get ahead of hitters. I feel confident going at hitters.'' Sabathia (5-1) allowed six runs and nine hits in 6 2-3 innings. He struck out five and walked one as the Indians lost their third straight. Dan Johnson extended his hitting streak to 11 games with an infield single in the second inning for Oakland, which won for the fourth time in five games. Johnson went 3-for-4 and scored a run. Sabathia, a native of nearby Vallejo, dropped to 1-5 with a 6.60 ERA in 11 career starts against the A's. His only win against them came in July 2003. ''It's me trying too hard,'' Sabathia said. ''Any situation anywhere else and I can stop the bleeding. I want to do well in front of my family so I try too hard.'' Ryan Garko had three hits, including a home run, and drove in two runs for the Indians. ''Garko had a real good night and a couple of other guys are going OK,'' Cleveland manager Eric Wedge said. ''We need to get everybody else going. That's where we're at right now. C.C. threw a great ballgame. He left one over for Cust and it dominoed on him from there. That doesn't take away from how he pitched.'' Blanton retired 15 of the first 16 batters he faced before Garko led off the sixth with his fourth homer. Blanton went seven-plus innings, allowing two runs and five hits. He struck out four and did not walk a batter. Justin Duchscherer pitched a scoreless eighth and Alan Embree worked the ninth for Oakland. Bobby Crosby's fifth-inning home run was the only dent against Sabathia until the A's scored five runs with two outs in the seventh. Cust's two-run homer on a 2-1 pitch from Sabathia made it 3-1. Sabathia walked Mark Ellis and then gave up consecutive hits to Jason Kendall, Shannon Stewart (a two-run double), and Nick Swisher (RBI single) before Tom Mastny replaced him and gave up a single to Eric Chavez before getting out of the inning.

Oakland optioned OF Danny Putnam to Triple-A Sacramento to make room for Milton Bradley, who was reinstated from the 15-day disabled list. ...

The A's drew 20,393 fans while across the plaza the Warriors' playoff game drew 20,655. ... The Indians have lost four straight to Oakland.

Give the Gift of SI Faces in the Crowd The ties that unbind Cold war with stepmother prompted Junior's big move Posted: Friday May 11, 2007 11:24AM; Updated: Friday May 11, 2007 12:31PM Despite a polished performance in front of the cameras and writers, Dale Earnhardt Jr. announced his departure from DEI with a significant sense of trepidation. It was a quarter to one Thursday afternoon, and was ready to head to his smaller-than-you'd-expect house in Mooresville, N.C., where he planned to sit on his porch, stare into the Blue Ridge horizon, and, in his words, "just think and think and think." Already, it had been a long day for him. Earlier that morning he had met with the 400 employees at Dale Earnhardt Inc. and, with wet eyes, told them that he was leaving the organization -- the house his father built in 1996, the only place for which he'd ever raced. A few hours later he had faced the media during a 50-minute press conference, fielding questions about why he was leaving, where he was going, and what his daddy would think now. Junior did a pro's job of concealing his emotions while the lights and the cameras were trained on him. He was so smooth that he didn't even take a sip of water from the glass that was set in front of him. He was in press conference mode -- a default setting that the biggest stars in NASCAR slip into out of necessity when in front of a crush of media -- and while he answered the questions sincerely, he was careful not to dig too deep. And so the clock had just ticked to 12:45 p.m., when I walked into Earnhardt's second-floor office at JR Motorsports. Little E wasn't doing any sit down, one-on-one chats with any print media other than , and right away I could tell he was emotionally drained. He smiled at me and pointed to a corner of the room, "Come on, man. Let's sit in these two chairs. I never sit over here." Thus, our discussion began. Some background: My first year covering NASCAR for happened to be Earnhardt's rookie season on the circuit, and my first story assignment was to do a rookie diary with him. We met frequently during that 2000 season, got to know each other fairly well, and since then we've have had an ongoing conversation. I've kidded him over the years about his endless search for the perfect woman (I know: easy target); he still ribs me about the day in Miami in '05 that his dog Killer literally ate a copy of , a book that I had recently authored. Never one to pass up a chance to make a joke, Junior wrote on one of the surviving pages, "Lars, I really liked the book, though it didn't taste very well. Signed, Killer." So Earnhardt and I have a bit of history, and after we spoke about some personal things for a chunk of time on Thursday, he slowly shook his head and said in a voice that was chocked with emotion, "I am scared s---less."

Earlier that morning he had met with the 400 employees at Dale Earnhardt Inc. and, with wet eyes, told them that he was leaving the organization -- the house his father built in 1996, the only place for which he'd ever raced. A few hours later he had faced the media during a 50-minute press conference, fielding questions about why he was leaving, where he was going, and what his daddy would think now. Junior did a pro's job of concealing his emotions while the lights and the cameras were trained on him. He was so smooth that he didn't even take a sip of water from the glass that was set in front of him. He was in press conference mode -- a default setting that the biggest stars in NASCAR slip into out of necessity when in front of a crush of media -- and while he answered the questions sincerely, he was careful not to dig too deep. And so the clock had just ticked to 12:45 p.m., when I walked into Earnhardt's second-floor office at JR Motorsports. Little E wasn't doing any sit down, one-on-one chats with any print media other than , and right away I could tell he was emotionally drained. He smiled at me and pointed to a corner of the room, "Come on, man. Let's sit in these two chairs. I never sit over here." Thus, our discussion began. Some background: My first year covering NASCAR for happened to be Earnhardt's rookie season on the circuit, and my first story assignment was to do a rookie diary with him. We met frequently during that 2000 season, got to know each other fairly well, and since then we've have had an ongoing conversation. I've kidded him over the years about his endless search for the perfect woman (I know: easy target); he still ribs me about the day in Miami in '05 that his dog Killer literally ate a copy of , a book that I had recently authored. Never one to pass up a chance to make a joke, Junior wrote on one of the surviving pages, "Lars, I really liked the book, though it didn't taste very well. Signed, Killer." So Earnhardt and I have a bit of history, and after we spoke about some personal things for a chunk of time on Thursday, he slowly shook his head and said in a voice that was chocked with emotion, "I am scared s---less."

At season&#8217;s end, he will leave the company his father started and his stepmother wouldn&#8217;t relinquish. He will not come back until the stepmother takes several steps backward and tosses him the controlling keys, which might happen about the time NASCAR cancels the Hellfire 500 on account of ice. The most plausible moment: Never. Junior mumbled something about possibilities 20 years down the road, which would make him 52 and retired. He was leaving a door open with public politeness. Privately, you couldn&#8217;t pry that door open with a case of 1955 tire irons. Earnhardt sounded extremely wistful. He used the word &#8220;honestly&#8221; more often than most athletes say &#8220;you know.&#8221; He didn&#8217;t speak or gesture or grin as though he knows everything, explaining in somber tones how he solicited advice while arriving at the decision. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always had a real hard time knowing what kind of weight I carry in this sport,&#8221; Earnhardt said. &#8220;Through other drivers and my sister and other employees of mine, I&#8217;ve been able to sort of come to an understanding of what that is and what that means.&#8221; Outsiders might laugh at the transparent absurdity of his modesty, but Earnhardt doesn&#8217;t know how he ranks overall because he knows how modestly his record ranks next to Jeff Gordon, Jimmie Johnson, Tony Stewart and Matt Kenseth. They have combined for eight championships and five seconds in the points race. Dale Jr. has never finished higher than third. He&#8217;s 12th in the current standings, the final spot eligible for the Nextel Cup chase. He has won 17 races since becoming a series regular in 2000, seven of them at restrictor-plate tracks Talladega and Daytona. He hasn&#8217;t won in a year, and he has made the top 10 only three times this season. Consequently, some analysts with no agenda consider Dale Jr. among the most overrated superstars in American sports. Friends and rivals tend to disagree, praising his abilities and deriding his rides. Earnhardt obviously carries enormous commercial weight. He will carry the rich Budweiser sponsorship with him wherever he goes. He concedes that he will not carry the No. 8, which corporate boss Teresa Earnhardt will control until NASCAR has a different idea. Junior will not need the 8 anyway, despite its role in three generations of Earnhardt racing history. He certainly won&#8217;t need the 8 if he winds up in Richard Childress&#8217; garage. Right there behind the old cars and aging wine sits a stack of museum quality No. 3s. Daddy&#8217;s number. The number Little E watched Dale Sr. drive while winning six of his seven points championships under the Childress banner. Rick Hendrick or Joe Gibbs, who run the other two powerful Chevy operations, could figure out an appealing number. Weight comes in different measures. Dale Jr. weighs more commercially than any other driver. He leads the circuit in T-shirt sales, die-cast model sales, beer sales, ad sales and popularity. He has by far the largest personal following, an army of his 21st century fans and Daddy&#8217;s 20th century fans and all those young folks who see him as kind of cool, in a real cool way. With that economic base, Junior will attract outstanding bids from rich suitors. He intends to drive the Chevy label. That seems almost comical when applied to the boxy car of tomorrow, which Junior loathes and smarter critics deride as the car of yesterday. &#8220;If I can speak frankly, I think there&#8217;s not one team out there that&#8217;s going to lay a dollar figure in front of you that&#8217;s any different than anybody else,&#8221; Earnhardt said. &#8220;They all probably can do about the same, so the money&#8217;s not really the issue. It&#8217;s not the guy that gives me, you know, the biggest paycheck.... .It&#8217;s more about some things that you can&#8217;t get with money - peace of mind and satisfaction in what you do every day and who you are and why you&#8217;re doing it and who you&#8217;re doing it for. And, I&#8217;m seeking to have that peace of mind and that comfort to be able to really, you know, be an asset to somebody. I want to go somewhere, really, and make some things happen for somebody and have that appreciation go back and forth there.&#8221; He evidently never had that relationship with stepmother Teresa. His description last winter: &#8220;It ain&#8217;t a bed of roses.&#8221; His sister and business manager, Kelley Earnhardt Elledge, spent months negotiating with Teresa Earnhardt&#8217;s front man, Max Siegel. The negotiations continued even after the widow told The Wall Street Journal that Dale Jr. had to choose between being a driver and being a celebrity. Dale Jr. and his sister insisted openly that their stepmother had to choose between relinquishing 51 percent of Dale Earnhardt Inc. or losing Dale Jr. &#8220;I really wanted to have a larger, more personal interest in driving at DEI,&#8221; Earnhardt said yesterday. &#8220;Through the contract negotiations, we were unable, really, to come to some terms that would give me that. We danced around that bush for quite a long time.&#8221; He eventually burned the bush to the ground and took the first lap of a long race to revitalize his smoldering career.

''I think he's been solid, just as he's been all season long,'' coach Scott Skiles said Friday ''He would have three double-doubles if the first two games weren't blowouts. ''I think he's playing well. I just think if we were playing New Jersey right now, the focus would not be on Ben Wallace. It's just the fact we're playing Detroit.

After the Bulls' loss, Wallace told media, ''I don't have to explain myself to nobody.'' And apparently he hasn't -- beyond the ''traffic'' excuse he gave during an ESPN interview. Skiles was asked Friday if Wallace, who was fined for being late, owed the team an apology. ''That would be up to him. Everybody else was there,'' Skiles said. ''I go round and round with my kids about this: An apology either comes from the heart or it doesn't. If you have to ask for it, it doesn't mean anything. ''We have a responsibility at all times. It doesn't matter if it's Oct. 5 and we're boarding a bus in Lawrence, Kan., to go to the game, or now.

I don't think that because it happens one time that it needs to be blown out of proportion.'' Reserve guard Chris Duhon has been late more than once this season, including for a team video session earlier this week. Duhon's tardiness is said to be wearing on Skiles. Duhon did not play in Game 3. ''No big reason,'' Skiles said of sitting Duhon. ''I just liked the way the game was going. I thought Kirk [Hinrich] had a lot of energy.

The formal announcement will come Tuesday at a news conference according to the team official, who requested anonymity because the announcement is pending. The Mavericks went from a league-best 67 wins to a stunning first-round elimination by eighth-seeded Golden State. Voting was completed before the playoffs. Being named most valuable player would ease the pain of losing in the playoffs for Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki.

That failure is likely to be remembered more than the fact he's the first European honoree, and the first not to have attended a U.S. high school or college. Nowitzki turns 29 next month, so he should have plenty more chances to fix his current playoff reputation. ? BROWN MISSES GAME 3: Jazz rookie G Dee Brown was forced to miss Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals against Golden State after he sprained his neck in a collision with teammate Mehmet Okur. Brown took part in light workouts during a morning shoot-around but had difficulty turning his head. "It's stiff. It's really stiff," Brown said. "I'm just blessed enough being able to move and talk to you all right now and turn my head a little bit." Brown hopes to be ready for Game 4 tomorrow night. Brown was hurt while trying to take a charge from Matt Barnes of the Warriors with 5 minutes 9 seconds left in the opening quarter of Game 2 on Wednesday night. Brown fell to the court and the 6-foot-11, 260-pound Okur then landed on him, driving Brown's chin to his chest. The 6-foot Brown, who weighs 180 pounds, remained on the floor for several minutes before being helped up and led to the locker room. ? DIOP STAYING PUT: The Mavericks exercised their option on C DeSagana Diop, meaning he will be with the team for the third and final year of his contract. Diop, who is 7 feet and weighs 280 pounds, averaged 18.3 minutes with 2.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks. Diop signed as a free agent with the Mavericks in 2005 after four seasons with the Cavaliers. -- From News Services Related Topics & Web Content Top 35 Most Viewed Comments that include profanity or personal attacks or other inappropriate comments or material will be removed from the site.

The formal announcement will come Tuesday at a news conference according to the team official, who requested anonymity because the announcement is pending. The Mavericks went from a league-best 67 wins to a stunning first-round elimination by eighth-seeded Golden State. Voting was completed before the playoffs. Being named most valuable player would ease the pain of losing in the playoffs for Mavericks forward Dirk Nowitzki.

That failure is likely to be remembered more than the fact he's the first European honoree, and the first not to have attended a U.S. high school or college. Nowitzki turns 29 next month, so he should have plenty more chances to fix his current playoff reputation. ? BROWN MISSES GAME 3: Jazz rookie G Dee Brown was forced to miss Game 3 of the Western Conference semifinals against Golden State after he sprained his neck in a collision with teammate Mehmet Okur. Brown took part in light workouts during a morning shoot-around but had difficulty turning his head. "It's stiff. It's really stiff," Brown said. "I'm just blessed enough being able to move and talk to you all right now and turn my head a little bit." Brown hopes to be ready for Game 4 tomorrow night. Brown was hurt while trying to take a charge from Matt Barnes of the Warriors with 5 minutes 9 seconds left in the opening quarter of Game 2 on Wednesday night. Brown fell to the court and the 6-foot-11, 260-pound Okur then landed on him, driving Brown's chin to his chest. The 6-foot Brown, who weighs 180 pounds, remained on the floor for several minutes before being helped up and led to the locker room. ? DIOP STAYING PUT: The Mavericks exercised their option on C DeSagana Diop, meaning he will be with the team for the third and final year of his contract. Diop, who is 7 feet and weighs 280 pounds, averaged 18.3 minutes with 2.3 points, 5.4 rebounds and 1.4 blocks. Diop signed as a free agent with the Mavericks in 2005 after four seasons with the Cavaliers. -- From News Services Related Topics & Web Content Top 35 Most Viewed Comments that include profanity or personal attacks or other inappropriate comments or material will be removed from the site.

Bogey-free Lee holds LPGA lead By Associated Press | Sarah Lee shook off some nerves and avoided the mistakes that plagued most everyone else yesterday, shooting a bogey-free, 3-under-par 68 to take a two-shot lead over Becky Morgan halfway through the Michelob Ultra Open in Williamsburg, Va. Morgan had just one blip on her card -- a bogey from a bunker on the par-4 14th -- but followed that with four birdies in five holes. Her 65 left her at 9-under 133, two better than Amy Hung, who had a 68 after making bogeys on two of her first three holes. Carin Koch (69) and Jimin Kang, who matched Morgan for the best round of the day with her 65 on the 6,306-yard River Course, were tied for fourth at 6 under. Dorothy Delasin (68) and In-Kyung Kim (68), Stacy Prammanasudh (70), Natalie Gulbis (70), Brittany Lincicome (71), and Birdie Kim (72) followed at 5 under. Lee's nerves were elevated after waves of people congratulated her on her course-record-tying 63 in the first round. "A good nervous," she called it. Cristie Kerr, the 2005 champion, got to 4 under after four holes, but managed just one more birdie and a bogey the rest of the way. She finished at 4 under after a 69. Paula Creamer fired a 69 en route to a 3-under total. Morgan Pressel shot a 72 and is also at 3 under, along with top-ranked Lorena Ochoa (69). -- Louis Oosthuizen held a one-shot lead after the second round of the Andalucia Open at Marbella, Spain, and Lee Westwood set a course record with an 8-under 64.

Manny Castillo, a Grade 10 Lorne Park Secondary School student, suffered severe head injuries during a junior rugby game at the school Wednesday afternoon. Manny Castillo, 15, was fatally injured during the final seconds of a rugby match Wednesday. (Peel District School Board) The school lowered its flag to half-mast after staff and students heard news ofÂ Castillo's death in the late morning. Grief counsellors were on hand to help students cope with the loss of the "well-liked" boy, said Peel District School Board spokesman Brian Woodland. The boy's family has decided to donate his organs through the Trillium Gift of Life Network, police said. An autopsy has been scheduled for Saturday to determine the cause of death. Witnesses say a rival player picked Castillo up in the final seconds of the game, and drove him head first into the ground. Peel Region police say the incident happenedÂ in an area outside regular game play. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be identified under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, was charged with aggravated assault Thursday. HeÂ has beenÂ released into the custody of his parents under strict conditions. Castillo'sÂ family has calledÂ the incident a "freak accident" andÂ urged police Thursday to drop theÂ charges, saying it's enough that one family has been devastated. "They were not playing volleyball. They were not playing checkers," the boy's uncle, Hector Castillo, told the Toronto Star. "We truly believe it was a freak accident â¦. I know that [Manny] would not want anything to happen to this kid." Police, however, say the altercation went beyond a regular rugby brawl. They are still investigating the incident and may upgrade the charge to manslaughter since Castillo has died. Family members and police are asking for any witnesses with videotape or pictures of the incident that may help the investigation to come forward. Hundreds of students and friendsÂ were atÂ the high school for a candlelight vigil Thursday night. Castillo's teammates visited him earlier Thursday, giving a signed rugby ball to the teen's family to show the support of their close-knit team.

BY ALICIA P.Q. WITTMEYER SURRY -- Property belonging to Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick has found a buyer - after less than 24 hours on the market - and apparently someone got a great deal. The white, two-story house, which sits behind a fence on 15 acres of land on Moonlight Road in southeast Surry County, was put up for sale Wednesday and was under contract the same day, said John Brooks, a Long & Foster real estate agent who often works with Vick. Brooks, who didn't help Vick with this transaction, said Vick asked $350,000 for the property, which has been the center of dog-fighting allegations after animal control officers recovered 66 pit bull terriers and beagles, some of which were heavily scarred, from the property last month. The assessed value of the house and land is $747,000. Brooks said he did not know how much the property was sold for. A Newport News native, Vick bought the land in 2001 for $34,000 and had the house built in 2003. The 4,608-square-foot house has five bedrooms, 41/2 bathrooms and a fireplace. Vick doesn't live in the house, which was most recently occupied by his cousin, Davon Boddie. Boddie was arrested on drug charges in Hampton in late April, leading to a search of the property by Virginia State Police, who found the dogs and equipment sometimes used in dog-fighting, including treadmills for training, scales, supplements and antibiotics, and a "rape stand" used to hold female dogs so that male dogs have easier access for breeding. Vick has denied any connection to dog fighting and has said he never goes to the Surry house. During a press conference Friday in Georgia, Vick declined to talk about the case or the sale of his house, saying his attorney has advised him not to say anything. No charges have been filed in the case yet, and charges against Vick have not been ruled out, Surry Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald G. Poindexter said Friday.

BY ALICIA P.Q. WITTMEYER SURRY -- Property belonging to Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick has found a buyer - after less than 24 hours on the market - and apparently someone got a great deal. The white, two-story house, which sits behind a fence on 15 acres of land on Moonlight Road in southeast Surry County, was put up for sale Wednesday and was under contract the same day, said John Brooks, a Long & Foster real estate agent who often works with Vick. Brooks, who didn't help Vick with this transaction, said Vick asked $350,000 for the property, which has been the center of dog-fighting allegations after animal control officers recovered 66 pit bull terriers and beagles, some of which were heavily scarred, from the property last month. The assessed value of the house and land is $747,000. Brooks said he did not know how much the property was sold for. A Newport News native, Vick bought the land in 2001 for $34,000 and had the house built in 2003. The 4,608-square-foot house has five bedrooms, 41/2 bathrooms and a fireplace. Vick doesn't live in the house, which was most recently occupied by his cousin, Davon Boddie. Boddie was arrested on drug charges in Hampton in late April, leading to a search of the property by Virginia State Police, who found the dogs and equipment sometimes used in dog-fighting, including treadmills for training, scales, supplements and antibiotics, and a "rape stand" used to hold female dogs so that male dogs have easier access for breeding. Vick has denied any connection to dog fighting and has said he never goes to the Surry house. During a press conference Friday in Georgia, Vick declined to talk about the case or the sale of his house, saying his attorney has advised him not to say anything. No charges have been filed in the case yet, and charges against Vick have not been ruled out, Surry Commonwealth's Attorney Gerald G. Poindexter said Friday.

The NBA has handed out its past three MVPs -- two straight to Phoenix's won in 2004 -- at the start of the second round. But it's believed the league opted to put some distance between Nowitzki's ceremony and the Mavericks' stunning first-round exit against Golden State. By the time Nowitzki collects his award, nearly two weeks will have elapsed since the 67-win Mavs became the just the third No. 1 seed in NBA history to lose to a No. 8 seed. The previous two No. 1 seeds to lose so quickly, however, suffered five-game exits as opposed to losing a seven-game series: Seattle in 1994 to Denver and Miami in 1999 to New York. More on Dirk Nowitzki Marc Stein joins The SportsBash on ESPN Radio to discuss his story on the selection of Dirk Nowitzki as MVP. Said Nowitzki, reached by phone Thursday night: "Nobody's told me anything. You [media] guys have been talking about it for a while, so let's see what happens. "[But] it's hard to even think about that stuff right now. Everything [from the Golden State series] is still pretty fresh. It's been some tough days since we lost." "I thought this was such an incredible year," Nowitzki said. "We won 67 games and then to lose in the first round, it just feels so empty right now." Asked to imagine what an MVP ceremony would be like after such a disappointment, Nowitzki said: "If I do get it, it's an incredible honor. I'm sure 20 years from now or whatever, to see that in the [record] books, it's an amazing achievement. But right now, it's hard. Obviously, you can't feel good about the way our season ended." Nowitzki averaged 24.6 points, 8.9 rebounds and a career-best 3.4 assists during the regular season and was the only player in the league to shoot at least 50 percent from the field (.502), 40 percent from 3-point range (.416) and 90 percent from the free-throw line (.904). His percentages in each of those categories were career highs, helping Nowitzki secure his third successive berth on the All-NBA first team, which was announced Thursday. But it all changed in the playoffs against longtime mentor Don Nelson, crafted a defensive strategy -- which included constant double-teaming, largely by fronting Nowitzki and then sending over help defenders on his catches -- that the 7-footer and Mavs coach Avery Johnson never solved. Nowitzki scored just eight points on 2-for-13 shooting in Dallas' Game 6 elimination and wound up averaging a mere 19.7 points for the series on 38.3 percent shooting and just 21.1 percent on 3s. Complete ballot results remain unknown, but all indications point to Nowitzki edging his close friend and two-time reigning MVP Nash for the award. In a recent survey of MVP voters conducted by The Arizona Republic, in which the Phoenix newspaper received responses from 96 of the 132 ballot-holders, Nowitzki totaled 57 first-place votes to Nash's 37, with receiving the other two. The German is poised to join Houston's Moses Malone (in 1979 and 1982) and Baltimore's Wes Unseld (who was rookie of the year and MVP in 1969) as the only MVPs in league history to lose in the first round of the playoffs. Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was named MVP in 1976 in his first year in Los Angeles even though his Lakers failed to reach the playoffs that season. Nowitzki said Thursday that he hasn't been watching much of the playoffs since the Mavs' ouster and that he's still in the process of finalizing his offseason plans, which are likely to include some travel to get a break from the game before joining the German national team for one last run at qualifying for the Olympics. Nowitzki has maintained for years that leading his country to an Olympic berth is his "dream." In an interview before the playoffs, though, Nowitzki left little doubt that he knew the consequences of another playoff setback, given the level of NBA media coverage and dissection compared to Malone's era and Dallas' collapse last June in the NBA Finals after taking a 2-0 lead over Miami. "I've said it a million times: We could go 82-0 and we know it means nothing unless we win it all," Nowitzki said on the eve of the Golden State series. "I know what's going on. If we lose [in the playoffs], you guys will say they can't win the big games and they have no leadership." Yet Mavericks management has stood staunchly behind their franchise player, pointing out that the 28-year-old is only a year removed from dominating a Game 7 on the road in San Antonio and hanging 50 points on Phoenix in a series-turning game in the conference finals. "Don't forget that we took away his point guard and his best friend [Nash] and that we went to a totally different style of play [from Nellie to Avery]," Mavs president of basketball operation Donnie Nelson said recently. "Every time we throw something new at Dirk, he masters it." After the Mavericks cleaned out their lockers for the summer May 5, Nowitzki told reporters: "I always take things very, very hard on myself. I don't need media people to tell me that I did bad. I know I didn't play my best in the playoffs. "I understand the business by now. If you play well and you win, you're the greatest. And if you lose, you're the worst player in the league. [It's] obviously not the position I want to be in, but it's nothing I can change now. I believe that everything happens for a reason. Hopefully I can learn from this experience."

http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/Indians_prefer_physical_assets_as_savings/RssArticleShow/articleshow/2015912.cms	Indians prefer physical assets as savings-Analysis-Savings Centre-Money Matters-The Economic Times Big Bucks: Inv. Guide Indians prefer physical assets as savings PRITI PATNAIK & SUBHASH NARAYAN [ TUESDAY, MAY 08, 2007 03:08:01 AM] NEW DELHI: Indians prefer their savings in the form of physical assets instead of financial instruments, and this trend is likely to continue despite the India growth story. Although financial inclusion is a mantra for the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the government, it is estimated that the financial savings of the household sector have been declining over the years. According to the report of the working group on savings in the 11th Five-Year Plan, &#8220;the estimates of financial savings of the household sector are showing a decline over recent years, whereas physical savings are increasing.&#8221; However, with a move towards financial inclusion, savings should go up, the report notes. Household savings is composed of both financial and physical savings. Financial savings in the household sector comprise savings in the form of currency, net deposits, shares and debentures, net claims on government, life insurance funds and PFs and pension funds. Savings in physical assets consist of net addition to physical assets of the household, comprising investment in construction, machinery and equipment and change in stocks. Since 2000-01, the household sector has shown a preference for saving in physical assets, which could be attributed partly to the soft interest regime in recent years. The way financial savings are estimated in India is that, the financial liabilities of the household sector, even if they finance physical assets, are reduced from the gross financial assets, the report says. Physical savings as a part of gross financial savings has been increasing. From 8% in 1993-94, physical savings have gone up to 12% in 2004-05. Analysts say that it is possible that physical savings may be higher than what is captured in the survey. Many black money transactions could artificially depress the cost of physical assets. Financial instruments are used to fund physical assets and not to create financial assets, an analyst says. The impact of corporate savings on household savings has also been flagged in the report. Usually, if corporate savings are going up, the household sector&#8217;s savings need to come down, since unincorporated entities, which constitute a part of the household sector, get incorporated and such savings are reflected as corporate savings.

Guide Calpers in India: Itâs $1bn & counting [ WEDNESDAY, APRIL 18, 2007 01:16:43 AM] NEW DELHI: The government may still have reservations over allowing pension funds in stock markets, but retirement savings worth a billion dollars of more than one million Americans have already been invested in Indian equities and this is likely to rise further this year. California Public Employees&#8217; Retirement System (Calpers), the largest pension fund in the US, has recognised India as one of the best performers among all the emerging markets in its investment policy report for 2007, approved by its board on Monday. Currently, Calpers has investments of about $1 billion in over 55 Indian stocks, which represents a whopping over 260% return since the purchase of these stocks. Market experts feel Calpers would be looking to expand its exposure to Indian stock market, as it has given impressive returns ever since the world&#8217;s second-largest pension fund with assets worth around $240 billion began investing here in 2004. India has remained on Calpers&#8217; permissible list of emerging markets for investments since its entry in 2004. For 2007, Calpers board has decided it might invest in 20 emerging markets including Argentina, Brazil, India, Israel, Malaysia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Turkey. The decision was based on a report from its consultant Wilshire Associates, which reviewed country and financial market factors such as political stability, transparency and labour practices of 27 emerging markets, Calpers said in a statement. According to the report, India and the Philippines made the biggest improvement in 2006, while a total of 10 markets improved their scores, two (Hungary and Poland) moved down the ranks and 15 kept their scores unchanged during the year. Calpers, however, would not be permitted public equity investments in China, Colombia, Egypt, Pakistan, Russia, Venezuela, and Sri Lanka. The pension fund, which provides retirement and health benefits to about 1.5 million state and local public employees and their families, had about $5.2 billion invested in emerging markets as of December 31, 2006. While announcing its annual report last year, it had disclosed investments in 55 Indian companies at a book value of about $277 million, whose market value stood at over $353 million on June 30, 2006 itself. It had recorded a total return of about 12% on its investments during the one-year period ended June 30, while marking the third straight year of double-digit returns. The cumulative current market value of these investments today stand close to $860 million, while the fund has further expanded its investment portfolio since the end of its last accounting year, which ends in June. Indian companies in Calpers&#8217; portfolio include blue-chips like Reliance Industries, Tata Steel, TCS, Tata Motors, SBI, Satyam, Reliance Energy, Reliance Communications, Maruti, Ranbaxy, M&M, Infosys, L&T, IPCL, ICICI Bank, HLL, HDFC Bank, Bharti Airtel, Bajaj Auto, Cipla and Dr Reddy&#8217;s Labs. Other Indian companies where it has invested are ABB, Allahabad Bank, Arvind Mills, Asian Paints, Aventis Pharma, Bajaj Hindusthan, Bharat Forge, Biocon, Cadila, Gail, Gujarat Ambuja, HCL Tech, PNB and Sun Pharma.

Guide States save 6k cr a year as small savings fund rate cut to 10.5% DEEPSHIKHA SIKARWAR & SUBHASH NARAYAN [ SATURDAY, MAY 12, 2007 03:06:17 AM] NEW DELHI: In a move that will provide substantial relief to states, the Centre has reset the interest rate on their loans from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF) at 10.5%. These loans were taken during 1999-2000 and bore a higher interest rate of 12- 13%. The move would help the states save about Rs 6,000 crore annually. The lower interest rate has come into play from the beginning of the current fiscal. The interest rate on current loans will remain at 9.5%. This follows a recommendation of partial debt restructuring package for states by a sub-committee of the National Development Council. The move to restructure states&#8217; debt is likely to improve their fiscal situation as their annual outgo will be lower, an official said. With the resetting of the interest rates, NSSF will lose an estimated Rs 1,500 crore in its interest income in the first year. The Centre may also allow states to prepay some of their high-cost loans contracted till 2002-03. States may also be allowed to go in for additional open market borrowings to prepay old non-NSSF loans. However, this would done only on a case-to-case basis keeping in mind the existing ceiling on market borrowing. Interest rates on old loans taken by states may be reviewed again if there is a change in interest rate on current loans taken from NSSF or after three years, whichever is earlier. The Centre has also implemented the sub-committee&#8217;s recommendation with regard to distribution of small savings collections from this fiscal. The collection will be shared between the states and the Centre in the ratio of 80:20, instead of the present arrangement of 100% transfer of collections to the state governments. States will, however, have the option to take up to 100% of their collections. Total NSSF deposits in 2007-08 are pegged at Rs 7,34,616.48 crore.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=7440	uwnews.org | Electrical engineering Professor Mani Soma named acting engineering dean | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Jan. 11, 2005 | Electrical engineering Professor Mani Soma named acting engineering dean Mani Soma, new acting dean of the College of Engineering at the University of Washington. Mani Soma, a professor of electrical engineering whose research involves the design of integrated circuits and bioelectronic systems, has been named acting dean for the University of Washington College of Engineering, the university announced today. He will start Feb. 12 and lead the college while a national search is conducted to find a replacement for Denice Denton, who is leaving the UW after nearly a decade as engineering dean to become chancellor at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Soma, 51, who has been with the UW since 1982 and once served as engineering's associate dean for organizational infrastructure, said he is looking forward to the challenge. "Denice Denton has done an outstanding job -- the college is on the way up and I plan to continue that," Soma said. "My philosophy, since I have been here and even before that, has been to do things that are fun. If it is not fun, I don't do it. It's a philosophy that works very well. We have a great team here and we'll work together to keep the college moving forward." Denton called Soma an excellent choice to lead the college during the search for her successor. "Mani is a very effective leader and has established good ties with other schools and colleges and with the central administration," she said. "I am working closely with him and other college leaders to ensure a smooth transition." Soma, who was born in Vietnam, earned bachelor's degrees in physics and math at California State University-Fresno. He then attended Stanford University for graduate studies, earning a doctorate in 1980. He worked for General Electric in Schenectady, NY, before coming to the UW as an assistant professor in 1982. In addition to serving as an associate dean for the college, he has been assistant director and director of various centers, and an associate chairman and acting chairman for the Department of Electrical Engineering.

http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/2010AP_BBA_Indians_Doby_Tribute.html?source=rss	Indians to honor Larry Doby's legacy Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 10, 2007 6:31 p.m. PT Indians to honor Larry Doby's legacy Cleveland Indians' Larry Doby appears in this March 1951 file photo. Doby, who followed Jackie Robinson across baseball's color barrier as the AL's first black player, will have his legacy honored when every member of the Indians wears his number on Aug. 10, 2007. (AP Photo/file) CLEVELAND -- First came No. 42, and No. 14 wasn't far behind. Larry Doby, who followed Jackie Robinson across baseball's color barrier as the AL's first black player, will have his legacy honored when every member of the Cleveland Indians wears his number on Aug. 10. Major League Baseball gave the Indians permission to wear Doby's retired No. 14, a tribute similar to the one on April 15 when the Los Angeles Dodgers and players on teams in both league's wore Robinson's No. 42 to mark the 60th anniversary of his major league debut with Brooklyn. "It's something that definitely needed to be done," Indians pitcher C.C. Sabathia said Thursday following the Indians' 8-0 loss to the Los Angeles Angels. "I don't think a lot of people know anything about him (Doby), but he was definitely huge. You hear all about Jackie all the time, and people lose sight of the fact that Larry was the first black player in the American League. "So he's as much of an icon as Jackie is. Hopefully this will open up people's eyes to what he did for the game." The Indians' commemoration for Doby will take place during their three-game series opener against the New York Yankees, starting off Hall of Fame/Heritage Weekend at Jacobs Field. Larry Doby Jr. will throw out the ceremonial first pitch. Each jersey worn by the Indians players and coaches will be autographed and auctioned off by Cleveland Indians Charities to benefit the Larry Doby RBI Program as well as a baseball scholarship fund in his name at Cleveland State. Sabathia wasn't well versed on Doby's story until watching a documentary on the center fielder, who played for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League. "I knew that he was a good man and worked hard," Sabathia said. "I was just impressed by it, the things that he went through. He was a great player. He hit for power and things like that. But you kind of lose sight on what type of player he was. I don't think a lot of people even know the type of player Jackie was because he was such a big icon for getting us in the major leagues." Doby's number was retired by the Indians in 1994. He was enshrined in the Hall of Fame in 1998. Doby became the AL's first black player in 1947, making his major league debut on July 5, two days after he was signed by Indians owner Bill Veeck. He batted just .156 in 29 games that season, but the next year Doby hit .301 with 14 homers and 66 RBIs as Cleveland won the pennant and the World Series. He batted a team-leading .318 in the series and homered off Boston Braves pitcher Johnny Sain in a Game 4 win. In 1952, Doby, a center fielder, led the AL in home runs (32) and runs (104). Two years later, he led the league in homers (32) and RBIs (126) while helping the Indians reach the World Series, where they were swept by the New York Giants. Doby was 79 when he died in 2003.

http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/2011AP_BBA_Athletics_Royals.html?source=rss	A's break out with 17-3 rout of Royals Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 10, 2007 4:01 p.m. PT A's break out with 17-3 rout of Royals Oakland Athletics' Eric Chavez hits an RBI single in the fifth inning of a baseball game against the Kansas City Royals, Thursday, May 10, 2007, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Dick Whipple) KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Dan Johnson, Jack Cust and the Oakland hitters got well in a hurry. After starting the afternoon near the bottom of the league in batting, scoring and home runs, the Athletics broke loose Thursday. Johnson and Cust each homered twice and the A's routed the Kansas City Royals 17-3. Danny Putnam hit his first major league home run and Eric Chavez also connected for Oakland. The A's set season highs for homers, runs and hits (18). The A's raised their team batting average six points to .244. "It was fun to be a part of," Cust said. "They say hitting is contagious. It started rolling early and didn't stop. We never let up, so that's the key. You get teams down, especially a young team you want to take advantage of and keep going." Cust's home runs both splashed into the right-field fountains and were an estimated 417 and 414 feet. "The way he hits the ball, he makes these parks look small," Johnson said. "I'm trying to squeak it out of here, while he's dropping them into the fountains. That is something else to watch." Johnson went 4-for-4 with two walks, driving in four runs and scoring four. Chavez had four RBIs and Shannon Stewart had four hits. Johnson was a triple shy of the cycle. "It would literally take me a calendar day to get a triple," Johnson said. "All three outfielders would have to collide. Every inning it seemed like I was coming up again." The Athletics improved to 29-7 at Kansas City since the start of the 2000 season. "When you start looking at history it is hard to figure out why or why not," Chavez said. Marco Scutaro was 0-for-21 lifetime at the ballpark before a two-run double in the sixth. Winner Joe Kennedy (1-2) did not allow a hit until Billy Butler's two-out single in the fifth. Kennedy left after six innings, allowing three runs on four hits. "There was a long layoff between innings," Kennedy said. "It's definitely a nice problem to have. As the game got longer and longer it was harder and harder to get back into the same rhythm I had in the first three innings, but I'm not going to complain." The Royals, who have the worst record in the American League (11-24) and have lost 100 or more games in the past three seasons, have lost five of six and 12 of 16. "Everything they hit fell in or went over the fence," Royals manager Buddy Bell said. "It was a bad game. I'm not even going to think about it, just throw it away." Luke Hudson (0-1), activated off the disabled list before the game, lasted just two-plus innings. He threw only 23 strikes in 50 pitches while giving up five runs on two hits and four walks. He'd been out because of a sore right shoulder. "I wasn't finishing any of my pitches," Hudson said. "I have a good idea about what I was doing wrong, so I can work on it. The shoulder is fine. You want to give your team a chance to win and I wasn't able to do that today." Putnam, who got into the game when Chris Snelling had to leave early, led off the seventh with a home run against reliever Neal Musser. Johnson and Cust hit consecutive homers later in the inning. Cust's two-run homer highlighted a five-run second inning. Chavez hit a three-run homer in the fourth as the A's took a 9-0 lead. "It couldn't have been a better day for us," A's manager Bob Geren said. "That's the best offensive attack of the year. I was happy to see Putnam get his first home run. That's pretty neat. It didn't seem like we were going to stop scoring. We were seeing the ball good." Johnson tied career highs for hits, runs and RBIs. He also matched his longest hitting streak in the majors at 10. Emil Brown hit a two-run double and Mark Grudzielanek had an RBI double in the Royals sixth. Notes: CF Chris Snelling left with a bruised left knee in the second inning. ... Royals C Jason LaRue bruised his left shoulder in the third inning and was taken for an MRI exam. Oakland's Adam Melhuse struck out on a pitch by Todd Wellemeyer, and the ball hit LaRue. ... Kansas City's Mark Teahen went 0-for-3, snapping his nine-game hitting streak. 1B Mike Sweeney went 0-for-2 with a walk, ending his seven-game hitting streak. He left with hamstring tightness after six innings.

http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/2010AP_BBA_Blue_Jays_Halladay_Out.html?source=rss	Jays ace Roy Halladay has appendicitis Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 11, 2007 4:24 p.m. PT Jays ace Roy Halladay has appendicitis Toronto Blue Jays starting pitcher Roy Halladay throws during first inning AL action against the Boston Red Sox on Thursday, May 10, 2007, in Toronto, Canada. (AP Photo/Nathan Denette,CP) TORONTO -- Former Cy Young Award winner Roy Halladay is expected to miss four to six weeks after having an emergency appendectomy Friday, the latest bad break for the struggling Toronto Blue Jays. Halladay arrived at Rogers Centre on Friday looking pale and complaining of pain in his lower right abdomen. Trainer George Poulis recognized the symptoms and took Halladay to a local hospital for surgery. Halladay was placed on the 15-day disabled list. The Blue Jays did not immediately announce a roster move. "You've got to look at it as a chance for someone else to step up," Blue Jays general manager J.P. Ricciardi said. "We're not going to sit here and raise the white flag, say we're quitting." "We've got some young kids who are going to get an opportunity now. We'll see who can handle coming up here and giving us those innings, giving us a chance to win." Halladay lasted only five innings and was hit hard in an 8-0 loss to Boston on Thursday, one start after giving up a season-high nine runs in an 11-4 loss to Texas. The 2003 AL Cy Young Award winner is 4-2 with a 4.37 ERA in eight starts. The rout by Boston was the Blue Jays' ninth straight loss and left them in last place in the AL East. On Thursday, Toronto lost closer B.J. Ryan for the year after he had ligament replacement surgery on his left elbow, and put right-hander Victor Zambrano on the 15-day disabled list with a strained right forearm.

http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/2011AP_BBN_Astros_Reds.html?source=rss	Griffey ties Palmeiro with 569th homer Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 11, 2007 12:12 a.m. PT Griffey ties Palmeiro with 569th homer Cincinnati Reds' Ken Griffey Jr. hits a two-run home run off Houston Astros pitcher Matt Albers in the second inning of a baseball game, Thursday, May 10, 2007, in Cincinnati. Catcher Brad Ausmus is at right. (AP Photo/Al Behrman) CINCINNATI -- Now that his hand is fully healed, Ken Griffey Jr. is climbing the home run list again. Griffey hit his 569th career homer Thursday, a two-run shot that tied him for ninth place on the career list and helped the Cincinnati Reds get a breakthrough 9-5 victory over the Houston Astros. Houston won the first three games of the series, improving to 5-0 at Great American Ball Park this season. Pitcher Woody Williams and the Astros make themselves at home when they come here. Williams called a vendor over to the dugout and bought four bags of peanuts during the first inning, sharing them with teammates. Griffey and Adam Dunn led the Reds to their elusive first win. Cincinnati pulled ahead 7-0 after three innings against starter Matt Albers (1-2) and held on. Dunn hit a three-run homer, his sixth in the last 11 games, and added a triple and a double, coming up one single short of hitting for the cycle. Griffey had a sacrifice fly and a two-run homer off Albers that left him tied with Rafael Palmeiro on the career list. Harmon Killebrew is eighth at 573. "Just keep plugging away," Griffey said. "My thing was I was just trying to get the guy home from third, and it just happened to go out." The 37-year-old outfielder has been on a tear since he moved back into his accustomed third spot in the batting order. Griffey has hit safely in seven of those eight games, with four of his six homers. He missed most of spring training because of a broken left hand, suffered last December. The injury wound up helping him as a hitter. "I wouldn't recommend it as a way to learn patience, but when you break your hand, you don't want to be swinging at too many pitches early," Griffey said. "It hurt the first three weeks of spring training. Look at how I took batting practice. The first couple of times, I didn't swing at very many balls." Aaron Harang (5-1) struggled to hold the early lead, giving up Chris Burke's three-run homer as Houston cut it to 7-5. Then, the Reds sweated out more bullpen drama. The Astros loaded the bases with one out in the eighth off left-hander Mike Stanton. Closer David Weathers escaped the threat after a frightful moment - pinch-hitter Morgan Ensberg's potential grand-slam drive hooked foul down the line. Ensberg took a few steps from the plate and pointed fair with his right hand, then gave up when he saw the ball hooking. "Not close enough," Ensberg said. "Off the bat, I thought I might have a chance. I could tell pretty clearly it was going to be foul halfway (toward the pole)." Weather recovered by striking him out on the next pitch, then finished it off for his seventh save in eight tries. Cincinnati's bullpen has only two saves since April 15. "I'm screaming, 'Go foul,' and he's screaming, 'Go fair,'" Weathers said. "Luckily, it went foul. It was a slider. Then I struck him out with a slider. Bad slider. Good slider." Houston was trying to reach .500 for the first time since April 23 and finish its first four-game sweep in Cincinnati since July 17-20, 2003, nine days before the Reds fired manager Bob Boone and general manager Jim Bowden. Four years later, the Reds are in another free fall, finishing a 2-5 homestand that dropped them into last place in the NL Central. They trail the first-place Brewers by an imposing 9 1/2 games. For once, they managed to contain Lance Berkman, who homered in each of the first three games of the series. Berkman has been a huge problem for the Reds throughout his career - 38 homers and 107 RBIs, his highest totals against any team. The Astros couldn't overcome a poor start by Albers, who got hit hard in his first career appearance at the homer-friendly ballpark. Dunn hit his team-high 11th homer in the first inning to set the tone, and added a triple off Albers in his next at-bat. "You'd like to win four, no question," Astros manager Phil Garner said. "We had a lot of momentum going into this game, but they took it away from us early." Dunn doubled in the fifth off Brian Moehler, leaving him only a single away from the cycle. No Reds players has achieved it since Eric Davis on June 2, 1989, against San Diego. Dunn grounded into a double play in the sixth, his final plate appearance. David Ross added a two-run homer in the fifth off Moehler. Notes: The Astros are 7-2 overall against the Reds this season. ... Berkman went 6-for-14 during the series with three homers. ... Burke's homer was his 200th career hit and his first homer since Sept. 12 at St. Louis. ... Dunn has two triples this season, matching his career high. ... 2B Brandon Phillips extended his hitting streak to a career-high 13 games.

Catcher Brad Ausmus is at right. (AP Photo/Al Behrman) Now that he's healthy, Ken Griffey Jr. has started to move up the career homer list again. Griffey hit his 569th career homer Thursday, a two-run shot that tied him for ninth place on the all-time list and helped the Cincinnati Reds finally beat the Houston Astros 9-5. Griffey moved into a tie with Rafael Palmeiro and is now four behind Harmon Killebrew for eighth. The 37-year-old outfielder has been on a tear since he moved back into his accustomed third spot in the batting order. Griffey has hit safely in seven of those eight games, with four of his six homers. He missed most of spring training because of a broken left hand, suffered last December. The injury wound up helping him as a hitter. "I wouldn't recommend it as a way to learn patience, but when you break your hand, you don't want to be swinging at too many pitches early," Griffey said. "It hurt the first three weeks of spring training. Look at how I took batting practice. The first couple of times, I didn't swing at very many balls." In other NL games, it was: Florida 3, Los Angeles 0; Atlanta 5, San Diego 3; Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 4; and Colorado 5, San Francisco 3. Houston won the first three games of the series, improving to 5-0 at Great American Ball Park this season. Pitcher Woody Williams and the Astros make themselves at home when they come here. Williams called a vendor over to the dugout and bought four bags of peanuts during the first inning, sharing them with teammates. Griffey and Adam Dunn led the Reds to their elusive win. Cincinnati pulled ahead 7-0 after three innings against starter Matt Albers (1-2) and held on in spite of more bullpen struggles. Dunn hit a three-run homer, his sixth in the last 11 games, and added a triple and a double, coming up one single short of hitting for the cycle. Marlins 3, Dodgers 0 Josh Willingham hit a three-run homer off Derek Lowe with one out in the bottom of the ninth to give Florida the win. Lowe (3-4) took a four-hitter into the ninth, but Hanley Ramirez walked to lead off, and third baseman Wilson Betemit was charged with an error when he failed to come up with a grounder. Miguel Cabrera advanced the runners by tapping out to Lowe. Willingham then hit the first pitch over the scoreboard for his sixth home run, ending a tense game. Taylor Tankersley (2-0) pitched a perfect ninth to complete a three-hitter. Sergio Mitre pitched eight innings for Florida, allowing three hits and three walks. Braves 5, Padres 3 Kelly Johnson came through with a two-out, bases-loaded double in the sixth inning for host Atlanta. Tim Hudson (4-1) yielded two runs and nine hits in six innings for the first-place Braves, who went 7-3 during an 11-day stay at home. David Wells hung a breaking ball to Johnson with the bases loaded in the sixth, and Johnson lined it into the right-field corner to make it 5-2. The Braves have scored a major league-leading 88 runs with two outs - more than half of their overall production. Wells (1-2) surrendered seven hits and walked four in 5 2-3 innings. Rafael Soriano pitched a perfect ninth for his fifth save in as many chances. Pirates 6, Cubs 4 At Chicago, Pittsburgh's Jason Bay homered and drove in three runs against Carlos Zambrano. Bay hit a two-run double in the first and led off the fifth inning with his fifth homer to help the Pirates (15-18) win their first series since they swept the Astros on April 18-20. Zambrano (3-3) gave up four earned runs and seven hits in six innings. He struck out six and walked two. Paul Maholm (2-4) went 7 1-3 innings for the Pirates, allowing four runs and seven hits. Salomon Torres pitched a perfect ninth for his 11th save in 14 chances. Michael Barrett, Aramis Ramirez and Angel Pagan homered for Chicago. Rockies 5, Giants 3 Aaron Cook neutralized Barry Bonds (1-for-3) and knocked in a run with a sacrifice bunt in host Colorado's win. Troy Tulowitzki hit a two-run double off Noah Lowry (4-3) in the third inning and scored from second base when shortstop Omar Vizquel threw wildly past third base after fielding Matt Holliday's bouncer. The Rockies made it 4-0 in the fourth when Cook sacrificed a runner home with a bunt. First baseman Ryan Klesko fielded it and threw to first for the second out of the inning instead of home for a play at the plate. Cook (2-1) allowed three earned runs on six hits and four walks without a strikeout in six innings. He cruised until the sixth, when San Francisco got all its runs on two-out, RBI singles by Ray Durham, Benji Molina and Fred Lewis.

http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/2011AP_BBN_Giants_Rockies.html?source=rss	Cook's sac bunts fuel Rockies' win Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 10, 2007 10:01 p.m. PT Cook's sac bunts fuel Rockies' win San Francisco Giants' Barry Bonds watches the flight the ball after hitting a double off Colorado Rockies starting pitcher Aaron Cook during the fourth inning of a baseball game in Denver, Thursday, May 10, 2007. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) DENVER -- Aaron Cook couldn't keep his fastball down. His bunts were another story altogether. Cook got bunts down in both of his at-bats Thursday night, one of them igniting a three-run rally and the other delivering the decisive run in Colorado's 5-3 win over the San Francisco Giants. "Oh, it's huge. Us pitchers all take a lot of pride in it. We work on it day after day, getting our bunts down in key situations," Cook said. "That first one was just a sacrifice I put out there and they happened to make an error. The second one was just one my own, there was no sign." Cook scored Colorado's first run when Troy Tulowitzki hit a two-run double off Noah Lowry (4-3) in the third. Tulowitzki scored from second base when shortstop Omar Vizquel threw wildly past third base after fielding Matt Holliday's bouncer for the Giants' second error of the inning. The Rockies made it 4-0 in the fourth when Cook sacrificed a runner home with a bunt. First baseman Ryan Klesko fielded it and threw to first for the second out of the inning instead of home for a play at the plate. "I was just reading Klesko back and knew Lowry was a left-handed pitcher, so I was just trying to push it out there on the left side and hoped Torry (Yorvit Torrealba) read it with me. And he made a great break when it hit the ground," Cook said. On Cook's first bunt, Lowry was charged with an error. "I was thinking second right off the bat," Lowry said. "I was going to go to second, and went to take the ball out of the glove and I just didn't have it. I decided to hold onto it. I probably could have thrown it to first, but I didn't want to rush it." Giants manager Bruce Bochy said, "Noah got a little greedy on that bunt, thinking second base, and that opened up a big inning there for them. That was the difference in the game. Lowry had good stuff. He just couldn't get a handle on the ball to get an out there." Cook (2-1) allowed three earned runs on six hits and four walks without a strikeout in six innings. He cruised until the sixth when San Francisco got all its runs on two-out, RBI singles by Ray Durham, Benji Molina and Fred Lewis. "They were up," Cook said. "Looking back, I probably hit a wall. I was starting to lose command of my fastball and they were all pitches I left up and they hit them right back up the middle." Lowry gave up four runs, two earned, on six hits and four walks in seven innings. Barry Bonds leads his team in several offensive categories and now that he's within 10 of Hank Aaron's record 755 home runs, he can expect to see a lot more bases on balls than pitches to hit, although on this night he got to take plenty of cuts and was walked only once. Colorado manager Clint Hurdle said before the game that he's going to walk the San Francisco slugger every chance he gets during the teams' four-game series at Coors Field. "If there's a base open we're going to put him on," Hurdle said. "I'm not going to let him beat our ballclub. It got 25 guys to answer to ... I've got ownership to answer to. One of the groups I don't have to answer to is to fans who want to watch Barry hit. I don't have to answer to those people." He strayed from that strategy, however. In the fourth inning Bonds came up with the bases empty and one out with the Giants trailing by three runs. Cook went at him and sent a 3-1 sinker off the right-field wall for a double, narrowly missing his 746th homer. "A four-seamer probably would have been off the third deck," Cook said. "A sinker goes off the wall." With one out and first base open again in the sixth, Cook pitched to Bonds and got him on a groundout to first base before Durham, Molina and Lewis hit run-scoring singles. In the seventh, Bonds came up for the fourth time with first base open and this time he was intentionally walked, putting runners at first and second with two outs. Manny Corpas got Durham to fly out to shallow left to end the threat. Corpas also threw a scoreless eighth inning before Brian Fuentes pitched the ninth for his ninth save in 10 tries, getting Durham to line into a double play to shortstop Tulowitzki with two runners on. The Rockies added an insurance run in the eighth, when Holliday tripled and scored on Garrett Atkins' sacrifice fly. Notes: Vizquel tied Ozzie Smith's major league record for shortstops with his 1,590th double play in the seventh and his third of the night. ... The Rockies joined the growing list of teams to ban beer in the clubhouses following the alcohol-related traffic death of St. Louis Cardinals P Josh Hancock.

http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/baseball/2010AP_BBN_Giants_Roberts.html?source=rss	Giants' Roberts to have elbow surgery Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 10, 2007 5:20 p.m. PT Giants' Roberts to have elbow surgery San Francisco Giants' Dave Roberts follows the flight of his RBI triple in the third inning of a baseball game against the Colorado Rockies in Denver in this April 17, 2007 file photo. Roberts said Wednesday, May 9, 2007 he expects to have arthroscopic surgery on his inflamed left elbow in the coming days to remove floating bone chips as well as bone spurs.(AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File) SAN FRANCISCO -- Giants center fielder Dave Roberts has decided to have surgery on his troublesome left elbow, possibly keeping him out for four weeks. Roberts said he could get the elbow cleaned out as soon as Friday or perhaps Monday. He made the decision after being examined by Angels orthopedist Dr. Lewis Yocum on Thursday in Los Angeles. "The appointment went well," Roberts said. San Francisco placed Roberts on the 15-day disabled list before opening a four-game series against the Rockies in Colorado and also designated outfielder Todd Linden for assignment. To fill the roster spots, the Giants recalled outfielders Fred Lewis and Dan Ortmeier from Triple-A Fresno. The team had hoped Roberts could avoid needing a scope until after the season. Yocum worked on Roberts' shoulder during his college days at UCLA, but the outfielder was still deciding who would perform the operation. The procedure removing floating bone chips and bone spurs - nearly identical to what slugger Barry Bonds underwent after last season - has a recovery time of about four weeks. Though Giants infielder Rich Aurilia healed quickly when he had surgery to remove bone chips in his right elbow in 2002 during his first stint with the Giants. He was out from May 20-June 3 that year and later helped the team reach the World Series. The 34-year-old Roberts homered in the Giants' 5-3 loss to the New York Mets on Wednesday, but noted afterward that he was heavily medicated and was fresh after not having played in the three previous games. He said he doesn't intend to stay on such harsh medication for a long period of time. Roberts didn't travel with the club after the game to Colorado, but hoped to meet up with the team at some point during its road trip that also includes three games in Houston before next weekend's interleague series against the Athletics in Oakland. Roberts had an MRI exam earlier this week that revealed the bone chips. He cannot fully bend his elbow, which affects him at the plate and his outfield play - so the injury is not just about whether he can tolerate the pain. From the Giants perspective, losing Roberts is huge considering Linden's recent struggles at the plate and Roberts' speed in the leadoff spot that makes him such a threat on the basepaths. San Francisco has up to 10 days to trade Linden or place him on waivers or he would be sent outright to Fresno. One of the Giants' most productive players during spring training, Linden was batting just .182 with no homers and three RBIs in 30 games. He misplayed a ball in right field Wednesday, but that didn't weigh into the decision. "We felt like we needed to get some more production and the two guys that we have called up are playing well down there," manager Bruce Bochy said at Coors Field. "Todd's a talented player but he was a little lost up there at the plate. I don't know what's going to end up happening with him here." Linden said he understood the Giants' sense of urgency, "It's just an unfortunate situation," he said before boarding a plane back to San Francisco, noting he believes something will work out for him soon. "I don't have anything bad to say about them. It's business. It's baseball." Roberts is batting .216 with two homers and six RBIs in 27 games and 23 starts in his first season with San Francisco. Randy Winn will be the primary center fielder with Roberts out, the spot he played last season. "It's tough to lose a guy who plays the way Dave does," Bochy said. "It's going to be good to see a couple of these kids get an opportunity, too." AP Sports Writer Arnie Stapleton in Denver contributed to this story.

http://intopr.prblogs.org/2006/09/14/second-life-holy-crap-i-get-it/	Into PR | Second Life: Holy Crap. I Get It! Journalist Feedback Surveys? Why Not? Mommy, Where Does Creativity Come From? Second Life: Holy Crap. I Get It! (I could have posted worse) of For Immediate Release nudged Chris Clarke and I , almost with alacrity, to give us insight to why we should be paying attention to Second Life. I must say that I finally get the program. Thank you, Shel. Although, I have to confess it was not the SL podcast that did it for me. It was this incredibly lucid video that I found As vapid and yawn-inspiring as the SL podcast was, I couldn&#8217;t force myself to listen to more than half of it. So I&#8217;m hoping the immutable revelations of SL didn&#8217;t come in the last five minutes. I would be emotionally devastated. In light of that video, I&#8217;ve come to understand that SL is indeed a haven for coteries of &#8220;eccentrics&#8221; that allows them to diffuse their shenanigans to unsuspecting newbies. It&#8217;s a place where a business looking to expand its marketability and advertising efforts into the realm of the Twilight Zone can market effectively to the weirdest people on the planet. In short, it&#8217;s a place where people can assiduously shoot poo from their bum and smile about it. It&#8217;s a place where a man can stand amidst enormous penises and get douched with a fuzzy substance unknown, free from worry of being arrested or at least laughed at. It&#8217;s a wonderland for business to cultivate and lay its roots. , I do want people to shut up about it. Or, at least, be a little less fanatical about it. Some act like &#8220;evangelists&#8221;; others act like hellions trying to sell their last bit of crack. Yes, all right? Yes. I get the value. I see the value. Wonderful value. We must pay attention to its value for businesses. But SL doesn&#8217;t make me see dollar signs or opportunities; instead it conjures images of and memories of how those movies had a funny way of making me feel not right inside. And, of course, the content I outlined here does not comprise the whole of SL. I understand that there are practically &#8220;normal&#8221; people there. I just don&#8217;t want to pop in for a visit. Into PR | IntoPR Joins Lewis PR pingbacked on April 26, 2007, 3:07 pm Owen; I think that is a perfectly fine way to think about it. I am very concerned about the dark underbelly of SL. Yesterday&#8217;s meeting was intereting and it was gret to talk with so many other PR bloggers. I certainly had fun, but I am still not convinced that my clients would benefit. Although, I do have a church client that might consider opening a church there. The place needs one from what I can tell. Posted September 15, 2006, 7:41 am I stopped by your site and looked through the transcript of the conversation. I&#8217;m sure it was much easier to understand when you were there, because it was very hard to read&#8230;but it gave me an idea. It seems there&#8217;s still a lot of confusion as to why we should be there. That was a question Chris Clarke asked just recently and I&#8217;d like to know the answer. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not a question that can be answered easily, if at all. I agree with you on the client point. I have a hard time convincing some people on blogging and its benefits, let alone a virtual world that one could walk around and visit places, spend real money on fake items like clothes and land, and be part of less than a million weirdos hanging out in a creepy environment. Shel is right. It&#8217;s a place we should monitor and keep in mind, but I think now is too soon to make any real money from it. I&#8217;m glad the meeting went well. Hopefully it will lead to many more discussions. It almost makes me want to join in on one, but if I went&#8230;I think I would fall asleep if all we talked about was SL. Posted September 15, 2006, 1:27 pm I personally think that we will move away from that eventually, we shall see. It is a good way to monitor, as you say. Posted September 15, 2006, 4:17 pm Kami, you might want to check out these folks: Posted September 16, 2006, 11:22 am I was in SL for part of the meeting that Kami hosted. It reminded me of the early days of the PRSIG on CompuServe when we held online chats in the evening, using 300 baud modems&#8230;tedious waiting for other people to finish typing&#8230;and SL seems like a very dismal place, with a few people building the private, gated islands they can&#8217;t afford in the real world. I&#8217;d rather see us using good quality collaboration tools and speaking over skypecast or some other VOIP tool so we could have real interaction. Don&#8217;t need to spend a lot of potentially billable hours outfitting a cartoon me. Posted September 17, 2006, 3:10 pm Thanks for weighing in, Steve. Shel Holtz and I have been going back and forth on whether or not this thing is worth spending time on yet. Of course he says yes (he&#8217;s practically in love with the program) and I say it&#8217;s just too early for the majority of clients. He does, however, have one good point. If we don&#8217;t monitor and participate, who will? If you&#8217;re not there, any number of PR companies will gladly take the business. I could argue how much &#8220;business&#8221; is actually there. 750,000 people is a pittance to some companies. But it&#8217;s always good to at least keep abreast of new forms of communication and interaction. Posted September 17, 2006, 8:58 pm I just stumbled upon this conversation, Owen. The video: WTF? Some people should not be allowed to use computers, let alone the internet. Clever title of this post, by the way - for a minute I thought you were &#8220;converted&#8221; until I saw the video. Holy crap, indeed. Posted September 19, 2006, 9:48 am I have to agree with Steve that it would be much better if it included real voice. But I imagine that will come in this technology. I also expect this techbology to come out of the Second Life silo and into a more open-source format in the future. Pathfinder; I did a search for &#8220;church&#8221; in SL and didn&#8217;t find you. Believe me Owen, I am just as dismayed by the &#8220;filth&#8221; in SL. Unfortuneately, it also exists in the real world, so no surprises there. Posted September 19, 2006, 12:41 pm Chris: Yeah that was my reaction as well. Of course that group doesn&#8217;t make up the entirety of SL, but it is what it is. Kami&#8217;s all over this conversation. And I agree with you, Kami. There&#8217;s some bad out there. There&#8217;s some good. Maybe what I&#8217;ll do if I ever join SL is create the first &#8220;SL Ghetto.&#8221; Go there and I&#8217;ll rob your avatar at gun point. Posted September 20, 2006, 2:31 am The good with the bad I say. Lord knows cyberspace is filled with the unsavory, the wicked and the just plain evil, but I doubt any one of us would shun the Internet. For me, too early to pass judgment either way, but I sure feel way cool talking about SL.

http://overtonecomm.blogspot.com/	Thursday, May 10, 2007 The Digital Brain Trust: Giving Our Memories Over to Machines Sitting in the doctorâs office today waiting for a routine exam (Big Announcement: for those that donât know, I am having a baby in July), I started to read some of the outdated magazines that seem to litter doctorâs offices. I came across a November 2006 issue of intriguing article written by Clive Thompson outlining Microsoft Research employee Gordan Bellâs experiment to store his entire life in a Dell computer. Bellâs experiment is called Bell records, videotapes, and scans in nearly everything to the project (save certain conversations with his wife, which she has smartly outlawed). The story drew my attention for a few reasons, one of which is that by being a digital personality and writing this blog, plus belonging to about a dozen social networking sites, in some very real ways I have opted in to this type of digital cataloging myself. I didnât remember knowing much about this project, so when I got back to the office I started to type MyLifeBits into my Google search bar and it automatically added the word, âproject.â So, sometime in the not-to-distant past, I must have searched on this topic â which sort of illustrates, in a way, what the project is about. Unlike Bell, I do not carry around a personal recorder to catch every conversation, not do I wear a camera around my neck, but in some very real ways, I do rely on my digital identity to help me store my memories. Bell proposes that to some degree or another we all are doing this. One that hits me at home is my electronic calendar. If an appointment isnât in my Outlook, and then transferred to my Treo, it simply doesnât exist. In the Fast Company article, Bell argues that the âchoice isn't whether you'll join the revolution but whether you'll embrace it.â I wonder if the concept of a digital file cabinet as a supplemental storage area for your brain is really all it is cracked up to be. Remember the claims that the computer would revolutionize the office, that people would have more time, and that paper would be completely eliminated? I donât know about you, but my desk is still full of paper and I most certainly donât work less because I have a computer. Then again, I do rely heavily on my computer to help me fill in the blanks of my memory. In this post alone I used Google to pull up the article with the autocomplete reminding me that I have searched about this before, I used my âfindâ button to pull the relevant information out of article and I used the collective brain of Flickr to illustrate the post. But the question remains, âHow do you keep track of all of your digital footprints?â âMyLifeBits is now so big that it faces a classic problem of information management: It's hellishly difficult to search, and Bell often finds himself lost in the forest. He hunts for an email but can't lay his hands on it. He gropes for a document, but it eludes him.â But researchers at Microsoft and beyond are developing better software applications to find all of the stuff that we seem to like to store. My question is what if the hard drive crashed and you âloseâ your memory, then what? Also, I take some comfort in âforgettingâ certain aspects of my past. I am not to keen with these being brought up at inconvenient times. What do you think? How does digital storage assist us and in what ways can it come back to bite? Are you comfortable with having a digital identity and having it follow you forever?

It was widely felt that it tracked the later. But now it seems that is back in the âauthorityâ business again with a new number. I noticed that a number is assigned to each blog that Technorati calls its âAuthority.â In a blog URL search, it replaces the number of links, leaving the total of blogs that link (see the graphic above). Technorati blog post about a new widget you can use to display your "authority" at your site, but I canât seem to find a good explanation of what this all means. All I find is the assertion that the higher the number, the higher the blogâs âauthority.â But what constitutes authority? So, in case you want to know, this blog has an âauthorityâ of 417. I hate metrics that are completely meaningless. posted by Kami Huyse at links to this post Thursday, May 03, 2007 Anatomy of a Social Media Campaign: Journey to Atlantis Today we launched our new project, , for SeaWorld San Antonio. I usually donât post about this stuff, but I think it is instructive in a couple of ways and I want to give the readers of a first peek, not to mention getting your feedback. A Place to Start the Journey We custom-built a platform on Wordpress that was orchestrated by and his crack team. It has been fun working with him on this project. sites that are all tied back to the main website. These platforms allow bloggers and coaster fans to easily post SeaWorld assets to their site and everyone can participate in commenting on the various social media platforms. Moreover, we have both a YouTube and Flickr group where people can share their own stuff Blogger and Coaster Enthusiast Outreach We have reached out to coaster enthusiast blogs and websites to include them in our media day on May 11, 2007, the day before the coaster opens. The response has been enthusiastic. We also included the sites we have reached out to in Obviously, I donât have many results yet, though we have had some coverage in a couple of blogs, which I am tracking in our . I am also tracking metrics with Feedburner, Google Analytics, and Veohâs cool interface to detect how views of our videos (so far a little over 3,000). I am always open to suggestions, so if you see anything, or have any ideas, let me know. posted by Kami Huyse at links to this post Tuesday, May 01, 2007 Cool Tools: 4 Advantages of Veoh Video YouTube is the gold standard social networking tool for video, but a few weeks ago, my friend and fellow blogger, , introduced me to . Over the past two weeks, I have been using it with some success. Online Videos by Veoh.com Veoh doesnât nearly have the reach of , but it does a few things well, and is especially useful for organizations trying to get their video out there. I have been experimenting with it on a new campaign I am putting together for , which is one of my clients. Here are the advantages of Veoh, from my perspective: Veoh syndicates your videos to Google Video, YouTube and MySpace for you. So, if you have multiple accounts, once you set it up in the interface, you only have to upload once. They have a professional video interface that is much nicer looking that YouTube. If you sign up for the free pro account, you can even personalize your Veoh channel Automatically Send New Videos: They have the ability to group videos into series. The most recent video plays in the main screen, but there are thumbnails of the other videos that you can scroll and play at the bottom (just push the play button and click on any of the thumbnails to see the other videos in the series). Since it is all done by code, as you update the series, it will also automatically update everywhere it is embedded across the net. Veoh keeps track of your video downloads across all platforms in one handy interface. So you can track your campaign very easily. There are a few drawbacks. The first video you upload may take as much as 3 to 4 hours to upload, but after the first one, I noticed the upload time was faster, though still considerably slower than YouTube. They also donât have a very good help section, but the has some good tech support information. posted by Kami Huyse at links to this post Friday, April 27, 2007 Staying Connected: Why Underground Blogging Doesnât Pay One of the great things about blogging is that it facilitates the ability to give and get real-time feedback from your peers. While it is not always easy to hear, sometimes others have ideas that might not have occurred to you, especially as we navigate the murky waters of Social Media Today Bryan Person called out ghostwriting a clientâs blog , in other words, not disclosing their identity in the A whole discussion ensued in the comments section about the merits and drawbacks of ghostwriting. But more important to me was the fact that the blog didnât have a direct way to contact the administrators, except through comments. To his credit, Tim Allik of the , the company that owns the blog, immediately made three minor changes that greatly improved the blog and its ability to communicate with its stakeholders: â page to include a media and blog contact Similarly updated the â â page and deleted the form they left for contacting the blog and replaced it with a real name and e-mail address Updated the blog footer to reflect who owns, designs, hosts and manages the blog We can argue over fine points, such as, "Is a blog is a blog if it isnât authored by a known personality?"; however, I think that it is more important to determine if a blog can accomplish what it was intended to accomplish. It seems the Air Hybrid blogâs only real shortcoming was that it made it really hard to get in touch with those writing it and making it clear who was responsible for the content. Not so anymore with their very minor changes. Let me illustrate with a personal story. When I first started Communication Overtones, I didnât include my e-mail address for a few months because I didnât want a bunch of spam. However, after a while, I added my e-mail and found that there was a whole world of networking I hadnât considered before. One of the great benefits of a blog is that it connects you with those you may have never known. It is an incredible networking tool. Over the last year, I have partnered with several bloggers in projects for my clients, including . It has made my offerings as an independent consultant much more dynamic. I have also gathered a vast network of my peers that I have called upon when I needed advice or even resources. In short, it pays to be accessible, and if you go to all of the effort to have a blog, why wouldnât you be?

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=27491	uwnews.org | Very long-term forecast: Northwest winters will be even wetter | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Oct. 18, 2006 | Very long-term forecast: Northwest winters will be even wetter A late-September satellite image shows the swirling cloud mass of a low-pressure center near Alaska's Aleutian Islands. The Aleutian Low appears to be moving north and east. If you think Pacific Northwest winters are gray and rainy now, just wait. By the end of this century winter storms are likely to be much more pronounced, particularly west of the Cascade Range, according to new University of Washington research. The reason is that the Aleutian Low, a low-pressure system near the Aleutian Islands that is most pronounced during winter months, is moving farther to the north and east, and the general track of storms coming from the Pacific is moving farther north. Not only that, but because of climate change the storms themselves are becoming more intense. By moving the storm track farther north, one might expect less rainfall in areas such as western Washington and Oregon. However, because the storms also will be more intense and will hit more directly, they will deliver a more potent rainfall punch than they do now, said Eric Salathe, a UW research scientist with the Joint Institute for the Study of the Atmosphere and Oceans, based at the UW. While western Washington and Oregon will be soggier than they are now, "Alaska will really get it -- Alaska and the British Columbia coast," said Salathe, author of a paper describing the research, which was published Oct. 13 in the online edition of the journal Geophysical Research Letters. His work indicates that western Washington and Oregon can expect 10 percent more rainfall in November, December and January by the end of the century, and coastal Alaska and British Columbia will get 15 percent more precipitation. The altered storm track means storms that now typically approach land from the southwest instead will hit more directly from the west, with the mountainous terrain wringing even more moisture from the clouds before they cross the Cascades. For his research, Salathe collected data from 10 commonly used climate models for the period of 2050 to 2100, giving the most weight to two models that most accurately portray existing conditions based on current data. He added information reflecting the movement of the Aleutian Low, one of the main centers of atmospheric circulation in the Northern Hemisphere, and the Pacific storm track. He also added data on expected changes caused by global warming and detailed topographical information for the Pacific Northwest. He then compared the model results with the actual rainfall from 1950 to 2000. Leaving a 50-year gap between the measurement periods, he said, made long-term changes easier to discern and prevented the findings from being skewed by short-term fluctuations that could occur naturally. The result is a marked increase in winter precipitation over the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest in the last half of the 21st century compared with the last half of the 20th century. "The atmosphere becomes more energetic because of climate change," Salath?aid. "It's not just the temperature increase, but the increased temperature drives a more vigorous circulation." He did not examine the most extreme events -- that's his next research effort -- but he expects that if the winter storms pack more wallop generally, then the most extreme storms will be more powerful too. "The seasonal mean is made up of four or five big storms and then mostly drizzle. It's the big storms that are important for flooding or the scouring of fish habitat," Salathe said. "If the mean is shifting, then you would expect that the extremes are shifting too."

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=31525	uwnews.org | Toddlers engage in 'emotional eavesdropping' to guide their behavior | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Mar. 26, 2007 | Toddlers engage in 'emotional eavesdropping' to guide their behavior Little children never cease to amaze. University of Washington researchers have found that 18-month-old toddlers engage in what they call "emotional eavesdropping" by listening and watching emotional reactions directed by one adult to another and then using this emotional information to shape their own behavior. Writing in the March-April issue of the journal Child Development, which is being published today, Betty Repacholi and Andrew Meltzoff of the UW Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences say the research indicates infants understand other people's emotional states at a very young age. "This may be a precursor to 'reading' other people's minds by understanding their emotional and psychological states," said Repacholi, an assistant professor of psychology. "Understanding other people's emotions is a lifelong skill and is crucial for school readiness. The fascinating result of this study is how sensitive toddlers are to the emotional dynamics of the interactions around them. They don't need to try out a behavior of their own and get rewarded or punished, they can watch what an older brother or sister does and learn from what happens to them," said Meltzoff, who is co-director of the institute and holds the Job and Gertrud Tamaki endowed chair in psychology. "This study helps fill in a missing piece, because it shows the children engage in 'emotional eavesdropping.' Children have their emotional antenna up all the time and they learn from eavesdropping on the behaviors of others." To test whether infants eavesdrop on adults to pick up emotional clues, the researchers set up two experiments. The first involved 96 toddlers, the second 72. In both experiments there were equal numbers of boys and girls. The youngsters watched an adult manipulate a toy in both experiments. Then they watched while a second adult expressed anger or a neutral reaction in response to the first adult playing with a toy. The infants then were allowed to play with the toy and imitate the first adult's actions. At this point in the first experiment the second adult either left the room or quietly sat with a neutral facial expression. In the second experiment, the second adult either turned her back on the child or silently looked toward the child with a neutral expression. Repacholi said all of the infants were interested in what the first adult was doing, were leaning forward, making noises and wanting the toy. But that changed when the second adult expressed anger and remained in the room looking toward the child. When the second adult reacted neutrally or expressed anger and then either left the room or turned her back the youngsters grabbed the toy within one second. They also imitated the first adult's action with the toy 2.5 out of three possible times. However, when the angry adult remained present and her neutral face was visible the infants hesitated, taking an average of five seconds to take the toy. They were only successful in imitating the first adult's action half the time. The researchers found no gender differences in how the infants reacted. "This was a real surprise," said Repacholi. "Parents usually socialize boys and girls differently and girls are usually more compliant. It may be that differences in this area will emerge later." The experiments are the first demonstration that infants can modify their own behavior in response to an emotional communication that does not involve them. "There are lots of studies of how the emotions parents directly communicate to their infants have an impact on their behavior. No one before considered if infants can take in emotional information when directed toward someone else and apply it to themselves," said Repacholi. "By observing and analyzing other people's emotional behavior, infants are able to quickly learn some important lessons. It is not only an extremely efficient way of looking at the world but is also highly adaptive. Infants can use emotional eavesdropping to avoid some of the negative consequences that might arise were they to perform an action themselves. It is also a pretty adaptive way of interpreting what is important and what they can get away with." The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the UW's Royalty Research Fund supported the research.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=13382	uwnews.org | When it comes to babies learning language, the eyes have it | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Nov. 9, 2005 | When it comes to babies learning language, the eyes have it UW Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences In top photograph, researcher Rechele Brooks, right, shifts her eyes from a 12-month-old infant to the toy in the foreground. In bottom photo, the infant follows her eye movement to the toy. Infants begin pulling off an amazing feat sometime in the final three months of their first year of life. They learn an important social interaction by following the gaze of an adult, a step that scientists believe gives babies a leg up on understanding language. University of Washington psychologists Rechele Brooks and Andrew Meltzoff have pinpointed this developmental step as beginning somewhere in the 10th or 11th month of life, and have found that infants who are advanced in gaze-following behavior before their first birthday understand nearly twice as many words when they are 18 months old. Writing in the current issue of the journal Developmental Science, Brooks and Meltzoff provide further evidence for the importance of eyes in human social interactions and trace how gaze-following develops in infants. Three years ago they reported that 12- 14- and 18-month-old infants are much more likely to look at an object when a person turns toward it with open eyes rather than closed eyes. "Our work shows that babies can look where an adult is looking but that it isn't easy, particularly at home where there are a lot of distractions," said Brooks, who is a research associate at the UW's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences. "We have found that at 9 months babies are beginning to do this by following the movement of the head. At 10 and 11 months they are following the head and the eyes. The eyes add important information and the babies are more consistently following the head when the eyes are open. It is as if a light is going off in their head. This is a clear shift and an important advance." Brooks and Meltzoff refer to the behavior of a baby (or an adult) looking where another has just looked as "gaze-following." Psychologist have known for some time that among adults detecting the direction of another's glance is a crucial component of human social interaction. "This line of research is important because following another person's line of sight is crucial for understanding the emotions of other people and, as we are now showing, learning about language," said Meltzoff, who is co-director of the institute and a professor of psychology. The new study is part of an effort by UW researchers to understand the development of gaze-following in babies. To do this, they tested 96 normally developing infants. There were 32 infants at each of three ages, 9, 10 and 11 months. Equal numbers of boys and girls in each age group were randomly assigned to eyes open or shut conditions. Each infant was seated in a parent's lap, across a small table from a researcher. Parents were instructed not to move their head or talk during the experiment. The researcher played with an infant before placing two identical toys on pedestals to the left and right of the table. Then the researcher resumed playing with the child before starting four head-turning trials. In the trials the researcher made eye contact with the infant before silently turning her head toward either the toy on the left or the one on the right. In the eyes-open condition, the researcher kept her eyes open and turned her head from the child to one of the toys for about seven seconds before turning back to the child. The procedure was the same in the eye-closed trials, except the researcher shut her eyes before turning toward one of the toys and didn't open them again until she was facing the infant. In a follow-up interview when the infants were 18 months old, parents were asked to check off on a list how many words their child understood. There were marked differences in the babies' ability to gaze-follow based on age. The 9-month-olds turned their heads toward a toy nearly as often in the closed-eyes condition as in the open-eyes conditions. However, the 10- and 11-month-olds looked at a toy significantly more often when the researchers turned with her eyes open than when she turned with her eyes closed. About one-third of the infants in the open-eyes condition also made simultaneous sounds such as "ah" or "hmm" when they engaged in gaze-following. Babies at this age are unable to speak but can make very simple sounds. Typically developing babies experience a burst of language between 18 and 24 months of age. In this study, the babies who simultaneously followed the eyes of the researcher and made vocalizations when they were 10 or 11 months old understood an average of 337 words at 18 months old while the other babies understood an average of 195 words. "The sounds they are making are very simple, but some children are looking and making these sounds spontaneously," said Brooks. "They are creating a social interaction or a link. There seems to be something special about the vocalization when they are looking at the toy. They are using social information to pick out what we are focusing on. They can't vocalize words, but they are carefully watching where we are looking. We think they are using social information and getting a boost in figuring out the social and language world together." "Although the babies are too young to talk to us, those individual babies who are most attuned to our eye gaze are the same babies who pick up language faster more than half a year later," said Meltzoff. "This is a fascinating connection between the social and linguistic world and suggests that language acquisition is supported by preverbal social interaction. "To do this a baby has an important social regularity to master: follow mom's eyes and you can discover what she is talking about. This study shows that babies first master this social information between 10 and 11 months of age, and it may be no coincidence that there is a language explosion soon thereafter. It is as if babies have broken the code of what mom is talking about and words begin pouring out of the baby to the parents' delight," he said. The UW researchers are following the same group of babies to see if gaze-following and vocalization at an early age predict increased language understanding and use at 24 and 30 months of age. The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the Tamaki Foundation, the Virginia Merrill Bloedel Hearing Research Center, the Talaris Research Institute and the Apex Foundation, the family foundation of Bruce and Jolene McCaw, supported the research. For more information, contact Brooks at (206) 685-2045 or or Meltzoff at (206) 685-2045 or . Meltzoff will be out of the country until Nov. 17 but can be contacted via e-mail.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=32511	uwnews.org | Children with autism have difficulty recognizing ordinary words | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff May 4, 2007 | Children with autism have difficulty recognizing ordinary words New research indicates that young children with autism have a difficult time recognizing ordinary words and more of their brains are occupied with this kind of task compared to typically developing youngsters. "Rather than becoming an expert in recognizing words, their brains slow down," said Patricia Kuhl, co-director of the University of Washington's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences and an expert in how babies acquire language. "Because these children can't distinguish what should be a familiar word their brains work too hard and they are unable to focus on new words. When they can't understand a word, they miss everything else that follows in a sentence." The research is part of an effort to understand why language disorders are a characteristic of children with autism as scientists begin to peer inside the brains of some of these children to understand what's behind their language deficits. Kuhl will present findings that compare 19-to 30-month-old typically developing and autistic children during a keynote address Friday (May 4) at the Sixth International Meeting for Autism Research in Seattle. She and her colleagues placed caps fitted with 20 sensors on the heads of the children and recorded brain waves that "leaked through their scalp" as the babies listened to familiar words (ball, dog, cat, book) and words that would be unfamiliar (verb, pint, bide, rate). The children also were exposed to common words that were recorded and played backwards. Backwards words produce sound patterns that are not characteristic of any language. The brains of typically developing infants responded with a unique pattern of activation for each of these types of words. The responses for known and unknown words were markedly different. With the backward words, the children's brains reacted as if they were hearing something totally different from the other types of words and gave a different signal, according to Kuhl, who is a professor of speech and hearing sciences. In addition, brain activity was focused in the temporal lobes of both hemispheres of the brain for each word type. The children with autism, however, showed no difference in their responses between known and unknown words, meaning they couldn't differentiate between them. However, their brains did react to the backwards words, and the pattern of activity was somewhat similar to that of the typically developing children. Overall brain activity in the children with autism was more diffuse and not focused in the temporal lobes, indicating more of their brains were tied up trying to understand the words. Earlier work by Kuhl showed dramatic differences in how children 32 to 52 months of age responded to a computer-generated warbling sound and "motherese," or baby talk, a speech form that is rich in phonemes. When given a choice by letting them turn their heads in one direction versus the other, normally developing children consistently preferred to listen to motherese, a near universal form of baby talk that is directed at infants and young children. Children with autism preferred the warble sound and chose it consistently. Youngsters with the most serious symptoms of autism had a stronger preference for the warble than did higher functioning children with autism. Kuhl believes there is some good news for parents from these studies because there are indications that some autistic children are achieving some learning. "One of the puzzles of autism is the variability of children with it," she said. "We believe the highest functioning autistic children have some recognition of phonemes (the basic sounds of a language). And this new study shows autistic toddlers can differentiate between backward words, which are not characteristic of a language, and real words. So some learning has gone on." "To crack the speech code children must be able to distinguish phonemes, understand known words and be able to decode the word order of a sentence in English or their native language." Kuhl said researchers need better measures and tools such as magnetoencephalography, which is a non-invasive technology, to test and look inside the brains of children with autism. "We'd like to know what kind of knowledge these children may have locked up in their brains. Children at the high-functioning end of the autism spectrum may have quite a bit. The first possible use of this research would be as a predictor of which children with autism might be responsive to treatment. With these tools we may be able to identify a part of the brain that is not responding, and that may suggest treatments by developing more targeted interventions." The National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute on Child Health and Human Development and the Cure Autism Now Foundation supported the research.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=32790	uwnews.org | 40 percent of 3-month-old infants are regularly watching TV, DVDs or videos | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff May 7, 2007 | 40 percent of 3-month-old infants are regularly watching TV, DVDs or videos A large number of parents are ignoring warnings from the American Academy of Pediatrics and are allowing their very young children to watch television, DVDs or videos so that by 3 months of age 40 percent of infants are regular viewers. That number jumps to 90 percent of 2-year-olds, according to a new study by researchers at the University of Washington and Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute. The findings are being published today in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine. The study is the first to look at the trajectory of media viewing in the first two years of life and to explore the content of what is being watched. The research also explores parents' reasons for permitting it. "Exposure to TV takes time away from more developmentally appropriate activities such as a parent or adult caregiver and an infant engaging in free play with dolls, blocks or cars," said Frederick Zimmerman, lead author of the study and a UW associate professor of health services. "While appropriate television viewing at the right age can be helpful for both children and parents, excessive viewing before age 3 has been shown to be associated with problems of attention control, aggressive behavior and poor cognitive development. Early television viewing has exploded in recent years, and is one of the major public health issues facing American children." Co-authors of the study are Dr. Dimitri Christakis, a pediatrics researcher at Seattle Children's Hospital Research Institute and a UW associate professor of medicine, and Andrew Meltzoff, co-director of the UW's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences. "This study is important because it teaches us about the media diet of infants who are too young to speak for themselves. Most parents seek what's best for their child, and we discovered that many parents believe that they are providing educational and brain development opportunities by exposing their babies to 10 to 20 hours of viewing per week," said Meltzoff, a developmental psychologist who is the Job and Gertrud Tamaki endowed chair in psychology at the UW. "We need more research on both the positive and negative effects of a steady diet of baby TV and DVD viewing. But parents should feel confident that high-quality social interaction with babies, including reading and talking with them, provides all the stimulation that the growing brain needs. It's not as though TV or a DVD provides an extra vitamin of some kind in the first two years of life, where we concentrated our research in this study. This area is one in which science, health and public policy all meet. We need to get our facts right so we can productively advise parents who so desperately want to do the right thing." The researchers conducted random telephone surveys of more than 1,000 families in Minnesota and Washington with a child born in the previous two years, and found the median age at which infants were regularly exposed to media was 9 months. Among those who watched TV, DVDs or videos, the average daily viewing time jumped from one hour per day for those children younger than 12 months to more than 1? hours a day by 24 months. The three most important and common reasons cited by parents for allowing their children to watch TV, DVDs or videos were: 29 percent believed these media were educational or were good for the child's brain. 23 percent said viewing was enjoyable or relaxing for the child. 21 percent used these media as an electronic babysitter so they could do other things. Even though educational content was the top reason given by parents, only about half the infant viewing time was reported to be in what researchers classified as a children's educational category. This included educational TV programs such as "Sesame Street" and "Arthur" and DVDs or videos such as "Blue's Clues." The remaining viewing time was roughly split among children's non-educational programs, baby DVDs or videos and grown-up television. Although parents believe in the educational value of TV, DVDs and videos, just 32 percent of parents always watched with their children. Parents also had an inflated idea of how much of these media other children were watching and believed that their children viewed less than the average amount. The study indicated that the perceived average viewing for other families is 73 percent higher than the actual average. "At the end of the day the amount of TV viewing is based on what parents think is normal," said Zimmerman. "Perceptions of norms tend to shape behavior even if those norms are inflated." So what can parents do to reduce the amount of time their kids spend in front of the tube? Zimmerman has several suggestions. "Parents often turn to TV for a break. A better suggestion would be to provide kids with simple activities to do. When parents are cooking, for example, they could have a low drawer with plastic dishes or wooden spoons available that a child can play with or make noise. This gives the child something to be engaged with while taking pressure off the parent. "A parent can also enjoy reading a fun or familiar book to a child," he said. "The child benefits from being close while the parent can get a breather. Children thrive on physical closeness." Zimmerman and Christakis are the authors of the book "The Elephant in the Living Room, Make Television Work for Your Kids" and Meltzoff is co-author of "The Scientist in the Crib: What Early Learning Tells Us about the Mind."

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=25475	uwnews.org | Practice builds brain connections for babies learning language, how to speak | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Jul. 10, 2006 | Practice builds brain connections for babies learning language, how to speak A six-month-old baby listens to sounds while a magnetoencephalograph measures the baby's brain activity. Experience, as the old saying goes, is the best teacher. And experience seems to play an important early role in how infants learn to understand and produce language. Using new technology that measures the magnetic field generated by the activation of neurons in the brain, researchers tracked what appears to be a link between the listening and speaking areas of the brain in newborn, 6-month-old and one-year-old infants, before infants can speak. The study, which appears in this month's issue of the journal NeuroReport, shows that Broca's area, located in the front of the left hemisphere of the brain, is gradually activated during an infant's initial year of life, according to Toshiaki Imada, lead author of the paper and a research professor at the University of Washington's Institute for Brain and Learning Sciences. Broca's area has long been identified as the seat of speech production and, more recently, as that of social cognition and is critical to language and reading, according to Patricia Kuhl, co-author of the study and co-director of the UW's Institute for Brain and Learning Sciences. "Magnetoencephalography is perfectly non-invasive and measures the magnetic field generated by neurons in the brain responding to sensory information that then 'leaks' through the skull," said Imada, one of the world's experts in the uses of magnetoencephalography to study the brain. Kuhl said there is a long history of a link in the adult brain between the areas responsible for understanding and those responsible for speaking language. The link allows children to mimic the speech patterns they hear when they are very young. That's why people from Brooklyn speak "Brooklynese," she said. "We think the connection between perception and production of speech gets formed by experience, and we are trying to determine when and how babies do it," said Kuhl, who also is a professor of speech and hearing sciences. The study involved 43 infants in Finland -- 18 newborns, 17 6-month-olds and 8 one-year olds. Special hardware and software developed for this study allowed the infants' brain activity to be monitored even if they moved and captured brain activation with millisecond precision. The babies were exposed to three kinds of sounds through earphones -- pure tones that do not resemble speech like notes played on a piano, a three-tone harmonic chord that resembles speech and two Finnish syllables, "pa" and "ta." The researchers collected magnetic data only from the left hemisphere of the brain among the newborns because they cannot sit up and the magnetoencephalography cap was too big to securely fit their heads. At all three ages the infants showed activation in the temporal part of the brain, Broca's area, that is responsible for listening and understanding speech, showing they were able to detect sound changes for all three stimuli. But the pure perception of sound did not activate the areas of the brain responsible for speaking. However, researchers began seeing some activation in Broca's area when the 6-month-old infants heard the syllables or harmonic chords. By the time the infants were one-year old, the speech stimuli activated Broca's area simultaneously with the auditory areas, indicating "cross-talk" between the area of the brain that hears language and the area that produces language, according to Kuhl. "We think that early in development babies need to play with sounds, just as they play with their hands. And that helps them map relationships between sounds with the movements of their mouth and tongue," she said. "To master a skill, babies have to play and practice just as they later will in learning how to throw a baseball or ride a bike. Babies form brain connections by listening to themselves and linking what they hear to what they did to cause the sounds. Eventually they will use this skill to mimic speakers in their environments." This playing with language starts, Kuhl said, when babies begin cooing around 12 weeks of age and begin babbling around seven months of age. "They are cooing and babbling before they know how to link their mouth and tongue movements. This brain connection between perception and production requires experience," she said. Co-authors of the study were Yang Zhang of the University of Minnesota, Marie Cheour of the University of Miami and Helsinki University Central Hospital, and Samu Taulu and Antti Ahonen of Elekta Neuromag Oy in Findland.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=26194	uwnews.org | Current desires distort children's choices about the future | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Aug. 14, 2006 | Current desires distort children's choices about the future Photos by Mario Dignard In top photo, a 4-year-old girl eats pretzels and becomes thirsty. Asked if she would like water or pretzels tomorrow, she picks water. When it comes to predicting what they want in the future, even a crystal ball probably wouldn't help preschool children figure out what they might want tomorrow. Psychologists looking at the largely unknown world of how children perceive the future have found that the youngsters' choices are warped when they are caught up in a primal desire such as thirst. The researchers, headed by Cristina Atance, a University of Ottawa assistant professor of psychology, used pretzels to induce thirst in 3-to-5-year-olds. Then they asked one group of these children whether they wanted pretzels or water right now and asked a second group if they would want pretzels or water for tomorrow. Another group of youngsters was not fed pretzels and, when asked to make these same choices for now or for tomorrow, expressed a strong preference for pretzels over water. This was in stark contrast to the first two first groups of children who almost unanimously said they wanted water both for now and for tomorrow. The findings, published in the current issue of the journal Psychological Science, show the extent to which young children's current desires can impact their choices for the future. "The popular idea is that children are rooted in the here and now," said Atance, "but little research to date has directly explored this claim. On the basis of this study, I think we can conclude that in some instances, at least, this claim is accurate. Co-author Andrew Meltzoff, co-director of the University of Washington's Institute for Learning and Brain Sciences and the Job and Gertrud Tamaki Chair in psychology, said, "We think of anticipating the future as being one of the most distinctively human traits. We don't only live in the present. It is characteristic of human beings that we engage in mental time-travel. We have present and future selves. Sometimes the needs and desires of the present self conflict with those of the future self." Atance said the study echoes well-known experiments that showed hungry adults bought more food at the grocery store than those who ate before shopping. The new study looked at thirst instead of hunger. For it, 48 children -- 16 three-year-olds, 16 four-year-olds and 16 five-year-olds -- were recruited. Equal numbers of boys and girls participated. The children were randomly divided into four groups. In two intervention groups, the children were individually seated at a table and given 36 pretzel sticks and encouraged to eat as many as they wanted while an experimenter read to them for 12 minutes. Afterward, they were asked questions that tested their comprehension about "tomorrow." Then the intervention was divided. Twelve of the children were told to pretend that they were going to come back tomorrow and play a game with marbles and were asked what they would like with the game, pretzels or water. In the other intervention, the children were shown the marbles, told they were going to play with them now and asked if they wanted pretzels or water. Children in the other two groups went through the same procedure except they were not given pretzels to eat during the reading period. Twenty of these 24 youngsters said they wanted pretzels and their choices did not differ when asked about now versus tomorrow. The results were the exact opposite in the intervention group with 20 of the children asking for water, including 11 of 12 who were questioned about what they preferred tomorrow. There was no improvement in the children's ability to distinguish what they wanted now and tomorrow by age, even though the 4- and 5-year-olds had a better concept of the different times than did the 3-year olds. Atance said the practical application of the research is that it can help parents and teachers better interpret young children's behavior and understand how difficult it is for children to think about the future. "For instance, we often see children object when mom asks them to put on their coat in a warm house before going outside into the cold, or when she tells them to bring water to the park when they are not yet hot and thirsty," she said. "Although we may think that the child is simply being disobedient, it may be that they don't understand that they might be cold or thirsty later." "Knowing about the future is something that is important in adult life," added Meltzoff. "All of education is built on the idea that learning things will be good for you and you will know more in the future. Young children almost have a mental inability to plan accurately for the future when they are in the strong grip of desire. Young children see their future selves through a present veil that is distorted by their current self. As adults we have tricks, experience, friends and spouses to help us focus on the future. Children don't have those capacities or resources." Atance and Meltzoff plan to continue this line of research with older children and hope to pin-point when children develop the ability to distinguish between present and future desires. The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and the National Science Foundation funded the research.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=26586	uwnews.org | Violence in the home leads to higher rates of childhood bullying | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Violence in the home leads to higher rates of childhood bullying Children who were exposed to violence in the home engaged in higher levels of physical bullying than youngsters who were not witnesses to such behavior, according to a study by researchers from the University of Washington and Indiana University. The study is one of the first in the United States to specifically examine the association between child exposure to intimate partner violence and involvement in bullying. It also is one of the first to break down bullying into physical aggression (hitting, pushing and other forms outward aggression) and relational aggression (teasing, being mean and ostracizing peers). Overall, 34 percent of the children studied engaged in bullying and 73 percent reported being the victim of some form of bullying in the previous year. Almost all of the bullies, 97 percent, said they were also victims of bullying. "Children learn from seeing what their primary caregivers do. They are very attuned and very observant about what goes on in a household," said Dr. Nerissa Bauer, lead author of the study and a former UW pediatrician who is now an assistant professor of pediatrics at Indian and Riley Children's Hospital. "Parents are very powerful role models and children will mimic the behavior of parents, wanting to be like them. They may believe violence is OK and they can use it with peers. After all, they may think, ?If Daddy can do this, perhaps I can hit this kid to get my way.' When parents engage in violence, children may assume violence is the right way to do things," she said. "This study supports the idea that parental violence can lead to violence between children and their peers," added Todd Herrenkohl, a UW associate professor of social work and co-author of the paper published in the current issue of the journal Pediatrics. "Children develop a mindset when they see how parents deal with problems. It is a script based on early observations in the home." Data for the study were drawn from the ongoing Seattle Social Development Project and the Intergenerational Projects, which are tracing youth development and social and antisocial behavior. Participants in these long-term studies were recruited from Seattle elementary schools, and 808 students (generation 2), their parents (generation 1) and their children (generation 3) have been followed since 1985. The bullying study looked at the behavior of 112 children from generation 3 who were 6 to 13 years old, an age group not normally examined in bullying research. Most previous bullying studies have focused on middle school-age children. The study focused on intimate partner violence, a somewhat broader term than domestic violence, for physical, emotional or sexual acts of violence. It includes couples who may not be married or living together. A 2000 federal study estimated that between 3.3 and 10 million children are exposed to intimate partner violence annually. Overall, 51 percent of the households in the Seattle study reported intimate partner violence during either or both of two specified times over a five-year period. It also found that: Girls reported higher rates than boys for bullying others, accounting for 61 percent of the reported incidents. Girls also were victims more frequently, accounting for 55 percent of the incidents. Children who are exposed to family violence are more likely to have internalizing behaviors such as early childhood depression, sadness and withdrawn behavior. There appears to be no link between witnessing family violence and relational bullying. Bauer said the study of bullying is relatively new and issues such as domestic violence and intimate partner violence traditionally have been sticky subjects for pediatricians to talk about. "Physicians may have been afraid of the answers they might get and may not know of community resources that are available. In the not so recent past, intimate partner violence was something physicians typically did not ask about. Today, it is recognized that family violence is common, with about 40 percent of women reporting they have been victims of it sometime in their lifetime," she said. "Physicians and teachers should be sensitive that when children display behavior issues that the possibility of domestic violence in the family exists. Not all children exposed to violence will respond in the same way, but there are many indirect effects and problems that you can see, such as engaging in bullying, not being able to make friends, not eating or those with extended school absences. But not all bullies come from violent families," she said. Herrenkohl said the study illustrates the importance of looking at how family events affect children over time and the power of the intergenerational transmission of violence. "We know that bullying leads to further antisocial behavior and this study shows how family violence leads to bullying. When intimate partner violence happens we can work with parents to show them how it can impact their children," he said. "A key is early identification of this kind of problem, but it is never too late to intervene to break the cycle of violence."

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=13735	uwnews.org | School programs targeting antisocial behavior also can boost test scores, grades | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Nov. 28, 2005 | School programs targeting antisocial behavior also can boost test scores, grades With the No Child Left Behind Act increasingly focusing schools' attention on test scores alone, programs that stress behavior, social development and commitment to school have sometimes gotten left behind. But a new study indicates that schools adopting programs that target antisocial behavior are also likely to boost their students' academic performance. The study of nearly 600 children by the University of Washington's Social Development Research Group found that risk factors such as substance use, delinquency and violence that can be identified and counteracted in elementary school also are good predictors of later academic achievement. "The implications are that prevention programs that address specific risk factors, curb antisocial behavior such as alcohol and cigarette use, stress a greater connection to school and promote social and emotional skills also contribute to academic achievement," said Kevin Haggerty, a co-author of the study. Haggerty also is director of the Raising Healthy Children Project, an intervention program that is following the progress of two groups of students in the Edmonds School District, a suburban area north of Seattle. One group received the intervention while the other did not. The new study indicated that higher levels of school attachment and better social, emotional and decision-making skills in the seventh grade were related to higher grades and test scores on the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL), given to 10th graders in 2002 and 2003. The WASL is a standardized test administered to students to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act. The study, being published in the November issue of the Journal of School Health, also found that lower student test scores and grades were predicted by higher levels of attention problems, disruptive and aggressive behavior and negative behavior by peers. In addition, early use of alcohol and cigarettes predicted lower test scores. "There is no stronger predictor of future problems than past ones," said Charles Fleming, lead author of the study and a research analyst with the Social Development Research Group, which is part of the UW's School of Social Work. "These findings show that if you make some difference in correcting negative behavior you can have a positive effect on school performance. This provides support, for instance, for programs being implemented in many elementary and middle schools to curb bullying behavior." Fleming noted that the researchers collected data from multiple sources -- from the students and their parents and teachers -- and that they got the same predictive outcomes from all of them. The researchers controlled for the students' scores on a standardized test given in the fourth grade, parents' level of education and socioeconomic level. "We wanted to see if the different behaviors that our prevention programs target also predict academic achievement, and they do," he said. The Raising Healthy Children program ran from the first or second grade through the 12th grade. The intervention included instructional workshops to help teachers become more effective in the classroom, workshops to teach parents better family management and monitoring skills and summer camps and study clubs for students. "Targeted school-based prevention programs can contribute to student academic achievement," Haggerty said. "We can't eliminate these programs because of claims that 'we don't have time for them during the academic day in the classroom.' These programs are important and they teach skills that children need to negotiate in the classroom and the school environment. When we teach them to children they are more successful academically."

"If your parents were smokers it is a double whammy because you are more likely to use drugs in general and even more likely to smoke cigarettes," said Karl Hill, a research associate professor at the UW's Social Development Research Group and co-author of the new study. "There is something about tobacco that if parents smoke, their kids are more likely to smoke. It may be that parents who smoke might leave cigarettes around where their children can see and get to them. Parents may not leave marijuana and alcohol around in the same way." Data from the paper were drawn from two long-term UW studies, the Seattle Social Development Project and the Intergenerational Project, which are tracing youth development and social and antisocial behavior. Participants were recruited from Seattle elementary schools, and 808 students have been followed since 1985. In addition to the participants, who make up generation 2, data were collected from their parents (generation 1) and their children (generation 3). The researchers also found a transmission link between the three generations -- child behavior problems such as conduct disorder (getting into fights, stealing) attention deficit disorder (lack of focus, can't sit still or maintain attention) and oppositional defiant disorder (problems with authority). "Children of smokers, heavy drinkers or marijuana users are more likely to have behavior problems when they are young, and consequently more likely to have drug problems themselves as they get old," said Jennifer Bailey, lead author of the study and a UW research scientist. "These children then grow up to be adult substance users, whose kids have behavior problems and the cycle is repeated." The researchers found that the link between general substance use and childhood behavior problems held up even when they controlled for such variable social factors as marital status, education and neighborhood conditions. However, they noted the popular notion that the children of substance users are fated to grow up using drugs is wrong. "Many people think that drug-using parents will have drug-using kids, but the effect is only modest and far from being deterministic," said Bailey. "A lot of children whose parents are smokers, heavy drinkers or marijuana users do not go on to be drug users or drinkers." Bailey and Hill believe their findings have strong practical applications in breaking the intergenerational cycles of drug use. "This means we don't have to tailor intervention programs for individual drugs except tobacco. These findings suggest that a general substance abuse educational program with an emphasis on tobacco should be effective," said Hill. Bailey added that prevention programs for chronic and severe child conduct problems also need to be continued and may aid in interrupting the intergenerational transmission of substance use. The benefits of successful interventions "may echo across generation" the researchers wrote, noting the negative effects of substance use by grandparents are observed not only in their children but also in their grandchildren. The National Institute on Drug Abuse funded the research. Co-authors of the paper were Sabrina Oesterle, a research assistant professor at the Social Development Research Group, and J.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=24065	uwnews.org | Multiracial youth more likely to engage in violence, substance abuse | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff May 1, 2006 | Multiracial youth more likely to engage in violence, substance abuse Multiracial adolescents in middle school are significantly more likely to engage in such problem behaviors as violence and substance use than single-race young people, according to a new study. Researchers from the University of Washington and the University of Chicago also found that perceived racial discrimination in school and in home neighborhoods puts adolescents at risk for these problems. However, the study suggests that a strong, positive ethnic identity can shield some multiracial youth from behavior problems. The study was published in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry. Among the findings, the study found that multiracial adolescents were significantly more likely than white, black or Asian-American youth to have smoked cigarettes. The odds were 38 percent less for whites, 32 percent less for blacks and 51 percent less for Asian-Americans. Similarly, whites, blacks and Asian-Americans were 45, 30 and 65 percent less likely, respectively, to have ever consumed alcohol than multiracial youngsters. Multiracial youngsters also were significantly more likely to have used marijuana and to have become drunk or high on drugs than white or Asian-Americans. There was little difference in these behaviors between multiracial and black youth. When it came to violent behaviors such as carrying a weapon, being in a fight and threatening to stab someone, multiracial youth again were significantly more likely to report having engaged in these activities than were whites or Asian-Americans. Fewer differences were found between multiracial and black youths, although the multiracial adolescents reported significantly higher rates of hurting someone badly in a fight (39 percent) and having carried a gun (46 percent). Overall, multiracial youth also reported a significantly higher mean frequency of engaging in violent behavior compared to each of the three single-race groups. All of these findings were adjusted for age, gender and socioeconomic status. "Adolescence is a difficult period for all children because two things are usually happening," said Richard Catalano, director of the UW's Social Development Research Group in the School of Social Work and a co-author of the study. "Parents are giving children more independence and they are moving from elementary to middle school where they are meeting new kids every 50 minutes. "This is also when drug and alcohol use begin, and rates of delinquency and violence increase. Being a minority is tough and many youngsters are experiencing discrimination. We suspected this, and now we know that there are higher levels of discrimination and problem behaviors among multiracial youngsters." Lead author of the study was Yoonsun Choi, who did much of the research while she was earning her doctorate in social work at the UW. She is now an assistant professor in the School of Social Service Administration at the University of Chicago. Other co-authors are Tracy Harachi, UW associate professor of social work, and Mary Gillmore, a former UW professor of social work, who recently moved to Arizona State University. The researchers surveyed more than 2,000 Seattle middle-school students, comparing behaviors of multiracial, white, black and Asian-American youth. White students were the largest group, accounting for nearly 30 percent of the participants, while there were nearly equal numbers of multiracial, black and Asian students. Data from the small number of Hispanic and American Indian adolescents in the middle schools surveyed did not permit meaningful comparisons. The students averaged 12.7 years of age when surveyed and girls made up slightly more than half of the sample. Among the students who identified themselves as multiracial, there were 25 different combinations of racial or ethnic backgrounds including 10 combinations of three racial backgrounds and five combinations of four backgrounds. About 80 percent of the multiracial students included some black background. "When it comes to multiracial youngsters, you have to take into account the experiences they are having with discrimination," Catalano said. "Discrimination felt by these children no doubt contributed to involvement in problem behaviors. Formation of identity is more difficult for multiracial children who have to figure out where they fit in and belong." Harachi noted that while multiracial children are at higher risk for substance abuse and violent behavior, in most cases the majority of the multiracial youth were not involved in these problems. "But there are growing numbers of multiracial children, and we need to know more about them," she said. "These behaviors don't start in adolescence, they begin earlier and are salient issues for these children. We need to grab on to problems earlier and address issues related to race and ethnicity early in their development." Funding for the research came from the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Child and Human Development and the federal Office of Minority Programs.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=12370	uwnews.org | Children whose parents smoked are twice as likely to begin smoking between ages 13 and 21 as offspring of nonsmokers | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Sep. 28, 2005 | Children whose parents smoked are twice as likely to begin smoking between ages 13 and 21 as offspring of nonsmokers Twelve-year-olds whose parents smoked were more than two times as likely to begin smoking cigarettes on a daily basis between the ages of 13 and 21 than were children whose parents didn't use tobacco, according to a new study that looked at family influences on smoking habits. The research indicated that parental behavior about smoking, not attitudes, is the key factor in delaying the onset of daily smoking, according to Karl Hill, director of the University of Washington's Seattle Social Development Project and an associate research professor of social work. Hill said other elements that influenced whether or not adolescents began daily smoking were consistent family monitoring and rules, family bonding or a strong emotional attachment inside the family, and parents not involving children in their own smoking behavior. The latter includes such activities as asking their children to get a pack of cigarettes from the car or having them light a cigarette for the parent. "All of these factors are important in delaying or preventing daily smoking, but parental smoking is the biggest contributor to children initiating smoking," said Hill. "It really is a matter of 'do as I do' not 'do as I say' when it comes to smoking." The study is one of the first to look at the initiation of daily smoking rather than the experimental use of tobacco. It defined daily smoking as smoking between one and five cigarettes daily in the previous 30 days at the time of each interview. The research is part of the ongoing Seattle Social Development Project supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse that is tracking the development of positive and antisocial behaviors among 808 individuals. They originally were recruited as fifth-grade students from elementary schools in high-crime Seattle neighborhoods. For this study, the individuals were interviewed at ages 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 21. The group was nearly equally divided among males and females. Forty-six percent were white, 24 percent were black, 21 percent were Asian Americans, 6 percent were American Indians and 3 percent were from other ethnic backgrounds. The study found differences in daily smoking rates both by gender and racial background. Over all, 37 percent of the individuals reported daily smoking by age 21 -- 42 percent of the males and 32 percent of the females. Whites (43 percent) were more likely to have begun regular smoking by 21 than were blacks (35 percent) and Asian Americans (24 percent). However, Indians (54 percent) were the group most likely to have begun daily smoking by age 21. Smoking rates predictably increased as the individuals got older. Just a little more than 2 percent had ever smoked daily at 13. That rate increased to 5 percent at 14, 12 percent at 15, 18 percent at 16, and 27 percent at 18. "Parents may feel that they don't matter to their teens, but this study indicates, they really do," said Hill. "It shows that such factors as not smoking, having good family management skills in setting rules and monitoring behavior, and having a strong emotional relationship with their children matter until the end of adolescence." Smoking prevention programs, he said, need components focused on parents, something they generally ignore, to help reduce adolescent smoking. Such programs are important since tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, accounting for about 440,000 deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Keeping children from smoking starts with parents and their behavior. Some parents say they disapprove of teenage smoking, but continue to smoke themselves. The evidence is clear from this study that if parents don't want their children to start smoking, it is important for them to stop or reduce their own smoking," Hill said. Co-authors of the study published in the current issue of Journal of Adolescent Health are J. David Hawkins, UW professor of social work; Richard Catalano, UW professor of social work and director of the Social Development Research Group; Robert Abbott, chairman of educational psychology at the UW; and Jie Guo, a former UW research scientist.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=26586	uwnews.org | Violence in the home leads to higher rates of childhood bullying | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Violence in the home leads to higher rates of childhood bullying Children who were exposed to violence in the home engaged in higher levels of physical bullying than youngsters who were not witnesses to such behavior, according to a study by researchers from the University of Washington and Indiana University. The study is one of the first in the United States to specifically examine the association between child exposure to intimate partner violence and involvement in bullying. It also is one of the first to break down bullying into physical aggression (hitting, pushing and other forms outward aggression) and relational aggression (teasing, being mean and ostracizing peers). Overall, 34 percent of the children studied engaged in bullying and 73 percent reported being the victim of some form of bullying in the previous year. Almost all of the bullies, 97 percent, said they were also victims of bullying. "Children learn from seeing what their primary caregivers do. They are very attuned and very observant about what goes on in a household," said Dr. Nerissa Bauer, lead author of the study and a former UW pediatrician who is now an assistant professor of pediatrics at Indian and Riley Children's Hospital. "Parents are very powerful role models and children will mimic the behavior of parents, wanting to be like them. They may believe violence is OK and they can use it with peers. After all, they may think, ?If Daddy can do this, perhaps I can hit this kid to get my way.' When parents engage in violence, children may assume violence is the right way to do things," she said. "This study supports the idea that parental violence can lead to violence between children and their peers," added Todd Herrenkohl, a UW associate professor of social work and co-author of the paper published in the current issue of the journal Pediatrics. "Children develop a mindset when they see how parents deal with problems. It is a script based on early observations in the home." Data for the study were drawn from the ongoing Seattle Social Development Project and the Intergenerational Projects, which are tracing youth development and social and antisocial behavior. Participants in these long-term studies were recruited from Seattle elementary schools, and 808 students (generation 2), their parents (generation 1) and their children (generation 3) have been followed since 1985. The bullying study looked at the behavior of 112 children from generation 3 who were 6 to 13 years old, an age group not normally examined in bullying research. Most previous bullying studies have focused on middle school-age children. The study focused on intimate partner violence, a somewhat broader term than domestic violence, for physical, emotional or sexual acts of violence. It includes couples who may not be married or living together. A 2000 federal study estimated that between 3.3 and 10 million children are exposed to intimate partner violence annually. Overall, 51 percent of the households in the Seattle study reported intimate partner violence during either or both of two specified times over a five-year period. It also found that: Girls reported higher rates than boys for bullying others, accounting for 61 percent of the reported incidents. Girls also were victims more frequently, accounting for 55 percent of the incidents. Children who are exposed to family violence are more likely to have internalizing behaviors such as early childhood depression, sadness and withdrawn behavior. There appears to be no link between witnessing family violence and relational bullying. Bauer said the study of bullying is relatively new and issues such as domestic violence and intimate partner violence traditionally have been sticky subjects for pediatricians to talk about. "Physicians may have been afraid of the answers they might get and may not know of community resources that are available. In the not so recent past, intimate partner violence was something physicians typically did not ask about. Today, it is recognized that family violence is common, with about 40 percent of women reporting they have been victims of it sometime in their lifetime," she said. "Physicians and teachers should be sensitive that when children display behavior issues that the possibility of domestic violence in the family exists. Not all children exposed to violence will respond in the same way, but there are many indirect effects and problems that you can see, such as engaging in bullying, not being able to make friends, not eating or those with extended school absences. But not all bullies come from violent families," she said. Herrenkohl said the study illustrates the importance of looking at how family events affect children over time and the power of the intergenerational transmission of violence. "We know that bullying leads to further antisocial behavior and this study shows how family violence leads to bullying. When intimate partner violence happens we can work with parents to show them how it can impact their children," he said. "A key is early identification of this kind of problem, but it is never too late to intervene to break the cycle of violence."

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=13735	uwnews.org | School programs targeting antisocial behavior also can boost test scores, grades | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Nov. 28, 2005 | School programs targeting antisocial behavior also can boost test scores, grades With the No Child Left Behind Act increasingly focusing schools' attention on test scores alone, programs that stress behavior, social development and commitment to school have sometimes gotten left behind. But a new study indicates that schools adopting programs that target antisocial behavior are also likely to boost their students' academic performance. The study of nearly 600 children by the University of Washington's Social Development Research Group found that risk factors such as substance use, delinquency and violence that can be identified and counteracted in elementary school also are good predictors of later academic achievement. "The implications are that prevention programs that address specific risk factors, curb antisocial behavior such as alcohol and cigarette use, stress a greater connection to school and promote social and emotional skills also contribute to academic achievement," said Kevin Haggerty, a co-author of the study. Haggerty also is director of the Raising Healthy Children Project, an intervention program that is following the progress of two groups of students in the Edmonds School District, a suburban area north of Seattle. One group received the intervention while the other did not. The new study indicated that higher levels of school attachment and better social, emotional and decision-making skills in the seventh grade were related to higher grades and test scores on the Washington Assessment of Student Learning (WASL), given to 10th graders in 2002 and 2003. The WASL is a standardized test administered to students to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act. The study, being published in the November issue of the Journal of School Health, also found that lower student test scores and grades were predicted by higher levels of attention problems, disruptive and aggressive behavior and negative behavior by peers. In addition, early use of alcohol and cigarettes predicted lower test scores. "There is no stronger predictor of future problems than past ones," said Charles Fleming, lead author of the study and a research analyst with the Social Development Research Group, which is part of the UW's School of Social Work. "These findings show that if you make some difference in correcting negative behavior you can have a positive effect on school performance. This provides support, for instance, for programs being implemented in many elementary and middle schools to curb bullying behavior." Fleming noted that the researchers collected data from multiple sources -- from the students and their parents and teachers -- and that they got the same predictive outcomes from all of them. The researchers controlled for the students' scores on a standardized test given in the fourth grade, parents' level of education and socioeconomic level. "We wanted to see if the different behaviors that our prevention programs target also predict academic achievement, and they do," he said. The Raising Healthy Children program ran from the first or second grade through the 12th grade. The intervention included instructional workshops to help teachers become more effective in the classroom, workshops to teach parents better family management and monitoring skills and summer camps and study clubs for students. "Targeted school-based prevention programs can contribute to student academic achievement," Haggerty said. "We can't eliminate these programs because of claims that 'we don't have time for them during the academic day in the classroom.' These programs are important and they teach skills that children need to negotiate in the classroom and the school environment. When we teach them to children they are more successful academically."

About 80 percent of the multiracial students included some black background. "When it comes to multiracial youngsters, you have to take into account the experiences they are having with discrimination," Catalano said. "Discrimination felt by these children no doubt contributed to involvement in problem behaviors. Formation of identity is more difficult for multiracial children who have to figure out where they fit in and belong." Harachi noted that while multiracial children are at higher risk for substance abuse and violent behavior, in most cases the majority of the multiracial youth were not involved in these problems. "But there are growing numbers of multiracial children, and we need to know more about them," she said. "These behaviors don't start in adolescence, they begin earlier and are salient issues for these children. We need to grab on to problems earlier and address issues related to race and ethnicity early in their development." Funding for the research came from the National Institute of Mental Health, National Institute of Child and Human Development and the federal Office of Minority Programs.

http://uwnews.org/article.asp?articleid=12370	uwnews.org | Children whose parents smoked are twice as likely to begin smoking between ages 13 and 21 as offspring of nonsmokers | University of Washington News and Information UW Office of News and Information Top RSS News Feeds RSS by UW Unit RSS by UW Expert UW IN THE MEDIA Media Officers and Staff Sep. 28, 2005 | Children whose parents smoked are twice as likely to begin smoking between ages 13 and 21 as offspring of nonsmokers Twelve-year-olds whose parents smoked were more than two times as likely to begin smoking cigarettes on a daily basis between the ages of 13 and 21 than were children whose parents didn't use tobacco, according to a new study that looked at family influences on smoking habits. The research indicated that parental behavior about smoking, not attitudes, is the key factor in delaying the onset of daily smoking, according to Karl Hill, director of the University of Washington's Seattle Social Development Project and an associate research professor of social work. Hill said other elements that influenced whether or not adolescents began daily smoking were consistent family monitoring and rules, family bonding or a strong emotional attachment inside the family, and parents not involving children in their own smoking behavior. The latter includes such activities as asking their children to get a pack of cigarettes from the car or having them light a cigarette for the parent. "All of these factors are important in delaying or preventing daily smoking, but parental smoking is the biggest contributor to children initiating smoking," said Hill. "It really is a matter of 'do as I do' not 'do as I say' when it comes to smoking." The study is one of the first to look at the initiation of daily smoking rather than the experimental use of tobacco. It defined daily smoking as smoking between one and five cigarettes daily in the previous 30 days at the time of each interview. The research is part of the ongoing Seattle Social Development Project supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse that is tracking the development of positive and antisocial behaviors among 808 individuals. They originally were recruited as fifth-grade students from elementary schools in high-crime Seattle neighborhoods. For this study, the individuals were interviewed at ages 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 21. The group was nearly equally divided among males and females. Forty-six percent were white, 24 percent were black, 21 percent were Asian Americans, 6 percent were American Indians and 3 percent were from other ethnic backgrounds. The study found differences in daily smoking rates both by gender and racial background. Over all, 37 percent of the individuals reported daily smoking by age 21 -- 42 percent of the males and 32 percent of the females. Whites (43 percent) were more likely to have begun regular smoking by 21 than were blacks (35 percent) and Asian Americans (24 percent). However, Indians (54 percent) were the group most likely to have begun daily smoking by age 21. Smoking rates predictably increased as the individuals got older. Just a little more than 2 percent had ever smoked daily at 13. That rate increased to 5 percent at 14, 12 percent at 15, 18 percent at 16, and 27 percent at 18. "Parents may feel that they don't matter to their teens, but this study indicates, they really do," said Hill. "It shows that such factors as not smoking, having good family management skills in setting rules and monitoring behavior, and having a strong emotional relationship with their children matter until the end of adolescence." Smoking prevention programs, he said, need components focused on parents, something they generally ignore, to help reduce adolescent smoking. Such programs are important since tobacco use is the leading preventable cause of death in the United States, accounting for about 440,000 deaths annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. "Keeping children from smoking starts with parents and their behavior. Some parents say they disapprove of teenage smoking, but continue to smoke themselves. The evidence is clear from this study that if parents don't want their children to start smoking, it is important for them to stop or reduce their own smoking," Hill said. Co-authors of the study published in the current issue of Journal of Adolescent Health are J. David Hawkins, UW professor of social work; Richard Catalano, UW professor of social work and director of the Social Development Research Group; Robert Abbott, chairman of educational psychology at the UW; and Jie Guo, a former UW research scientist.

Bundles of hay were used to outline the site of the first house, which will serve as a model home and visitor center while construction of other houses is under way. The first house is expected to be completed in August - around the second anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. The home will be made with energy-saving materials such as metal roofing and recycled textiles. "Hopefully this can be a model for the level of redevelopment that can be done here," said Matt Petersen, president and CEO of Global Green USA, the environmental group working with Pitt on the project. Global Green plans to sell the homes and plans to give preference to former residents of the Lower 9th Ward's Holy Cross neighborhood, where the homes are being constructed. Though absent from Thursday's celebration, Pitt, who's appeared in such films as "Babel" and the upcoming "Ocean's Thirteen," issued a statement to organizers from Prague, where he is visiting Angelina Jolie, who's making a movie there. "I'm crying out for one of our leaders to really make this a priority," he said. More than 1,000 New Orleans area schoolchildren were invited to Thursday's ceremony because Global Green is working to make their schools more energy efficient. During a news conference Thursday, organizers announced that the Home Depot Foundation will be a partner in the 9th Ward project, which started with a design competition by Pitt in April 2006. The winning plan, announced in August, was submitted by Matthew Berman and Andrew Kotchen of Workshop APD in New York. It includes designs for about a half-dozen single-family housing units, 18 apartments, a community center, play area and pedestrian. Pitt has contributed $100,000 to help underwrite the contest and another $100,000 to help cover contest prize money; the whole project is valued at $7 million to $9 million. In January, he and Jolie purchased an early-1830s masonry mansion in the French Quarter for $3.5 million. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Clooney, Pitt, Matt Damon and Don Cheadle along with producer Jerry Weintraub are using events surrounding the movie's premiere next month to promote their Web site, ., which is partnering with the International Rescue Committee to raise funds to aid the hundreds of thousands of people uprooted by the Darfur conflict. "All the guys have been to the Sudan this year. They saw this huge genocide and nobody doing anything about it," Weintraub said in an interview Thursday. "Clooney got attention earlier, but it faded." "What we are trying to do here is bring our celebrity to raise money and bring a spotlight on Sudan again. We decided to dedicate ourselves to this. The thing I am most proud of by far is that these events will benefit a cause that is very important to me and my colleagues." There will be benefit screenings of "Ocean's Thirteen," a Warner Bros. Pictures release, to raise funds for Not On Our Watch and the IRC, including a special June 6 screening at the CineVegas Film Festival in Las Vegas, where Weintraub will receive a special Vanguard Producer Award celebrating his half-century in show business. Other events surrounding the film's June 8 nationwide release include the May 24 fundraising debut in Cannes, France, and the June 5 North American premiere at Grauman's Chinese Theatre, where Clooney and the other stars will leave their footprints in the wet cement outside the Hollywood tourist spot. In "Ocean's Thirteen," directed by Steven Soderbergh, Clooney reprises his role as Danny Ocean, who reassembles his crew of master criminals to take revenge on a hated Las Vegas businessman and casino owner played by Al Pacino. The 69-year-old Weintraub plans to visit the Darfur region later this year. "It's not a pleasant place to go," he said. "They don't need another tourist like me going there. I can do a lot more good here raising money. But I will go. We are all very good friends so when one does something we all get onboard." At least 200,000 people have died and 2.5 million have been chased from their homes since 2003 when ethnic African rebels in Darfur rose up against the Arab-dominated central government. The Sudanese government is accused of retaliating by arming local nomadic tribes and unleashing militias known as the janjaweed - a charge the government denies.

(AP) -- A judge praised Mel Gibson on Friday for maintaining his court-ordered treatment for alcoholism following his drunken-driving arrest last July. "I truly believe the rehabilitation that is being effected in this case is effective, and I don't want anything to interrupt that," said Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mira. The 51-year-old actor-director didn't attend the progress report hearing, but Gibson's attorney, Blair Berk, told the judge she filed a report with the court saying Gibson was complying with all the terms and conditions of his rehabilitation program. "He's doing very well. He's working hard," Gibson's publicist, Alan Nierob, told The Associated Press on Friday. "This is just an ongoing process that he's committed to." Mira added that he wanted to see Gibson in court at some point "to ensure we are all on the same page." Gibson pleaded no contest to charges of drunken driving Aug. 17 under a deal that included serving three years' probation, a fine and alcohol-rehabilitation classes. He was arrested on a Malibu highway in July after a sheriff's deputy caught him speeding. Gibson's anti-Semitic remarks to the deputy sparked outrage, and he later apologized. Gibson starred in the "Lethal Weapons" movies. His directing credits include 2004's "The Passion of the Christ" and last year's Mayan epic "Apocalypto."

Moore took the trip, for a segment in the film, with about 10 ailing workers involved in the rescue effort at the World Trade Center ruins. The Communist Party daily Granma called the 45-year-old U.S. travel and trade sanctions "a criminal action that has cost lives and grave consequences for the inhabitants of the island," as well as Americans. "Any resemblance to McCarthyism is no coincidence," the newspaper opined, referring to the political witch hunt that U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy carried out against suspected American communists in the 1950s. The U.S. government's targeting of Moore "confirms the imperial philosophy of censorship" by American officials, it added. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which oversees U.S. sanctions against other nations, sent a letter to Moore on May 2, notifying him of a civil probe for possible violations of the U.S. trade embargo. Treasury officials in Washington said Friday they would have no comment on the contents of Moore's letter, citing a policy against discussing specific investigations. But Treasury spokeswoman AnnMarie Hauser said OFAC issues hundreds of letters each year asking for additional information when possible sanctions violations have occurred. The filmmaker suggested Friday that the probe was politically motivated. "I understand why the Bush administration is coming after me - I have tried to help the very people they refuse to help," Moore wrote in the letter, which he posted on the liberal Web site Daily Kos. "But until George W. Bush outlaws helping your fellow man, I have broken no laws and I have nothing to hide." Moore confronted America's passion for guns in "Bowling for Columbine," which won the 2002 Oscar for best documentary, and skewered President Bush over his handling of Sept. 11 in "Fahrenheit 9/11."

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FILM_MOVIE_RATINGS_SMOKING_GMOV-?SITE=PAGRE&SECTION=ARTS&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT	Robert Fryer, Managing Editor Joe Chudicek, Multimedia Editor Customized RSS News Feeds May 10, 9:57 PM EDT MPAA adds smoking as film-rating factor LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Smoking will be a bigger factor in determining film ratings, the Motion Picture Association of America said Thursday, but critics said the move does not go far enough to discourage teens from taking up the habit. MPAA Chairman Dan Glickman said his group's ratings board, which previously had considered underage smoking in assigning film ratings, now will take into account smoking by adults, as well. That adds smoking to a list of such factors as sex, violence and language in determining the MPAA's G, PG, PG-13, R and NC-17 ratings. Film raters will consider the pervasiveness of tobacco use, whether it glamorizes smoking and the context in which smoking appears, as in movies set in the past when smoking was more common. Some critics of Hollywood's depictions of tobacco in films have urged that movies that show smoking be assigned an R rating, which would restrict those younger than 17 from seeing them. "I'm glad it's finally an issue they're taking up, but what they're proposing does not go far enough and is not going to make a difference," said Kori Titus, spokeswoman for Breathe California, which opposes film images of tobacco use that might encourage young people to start smoking. Glickman said a mandatory R rating for smoking would not "further the specific goal of providing information to parents on this issue." Smoking in movies with a G, PG or PG-13 rating has been on the decline, and the "percentage of films that included even a fleeting glimpse of smoking" declined from 60 percent to 52 percent between July 2004 and July 2006," Glickman said. Of those films, three-fourths received an R rating for other reasons, he said. "That means there's not a great amount of films in the unrestricted category as it stands," said Joan Graves, who heads the ratings board. "We're not saying we're ignoring the issue. We're trying the best way possible according to what we've learned from parents to give them information about what's in a film." Titus said smoking in films had declined in recent years but remains more prevalent than MPAA figures indicate. Descriptions on sex, violence and language that accompany movie ratings now will include such phrases as "glamorized smoking" or "pervasive smoking," Glickman said. If rated today, a film such as 2005's "Good Night, and Good Luck," about chain-smoking newsman Edward R. Murrow, would have carried a "pervasive smoking" tag but probably would have retained its PG rating because of its historical context in the 1950s, Graves said. Titus said film raters should be as tough on smoking as they are on bad language to minimize the effects of on-screen smoking on children, including her own 5-year-old daughter. "I don't want her using that language, but last time I checked, she's probably not going to die from that," Titus said. "If she starts smoking from these images she sees in movies, chances are she's probably going to die early from that." While Titus' group wants tougher ratings restrictions, the MPAA released statements of support for its plan from John Seffrin, chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society, U.S. Sen. Joe Biden and filmmaker Rob Reiner, among others. "By placing smoking on a par with considerations of violence and sex, the rating board has acknowledged the public-health dangers to children associated with glamorized images of a toxic and lethal addiction to tobacco," Barry Bloom, dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, said in a statement. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

The 32-year-old actress recently returned from a trip to Kenya, where she toured WFP-supported school meal projects, the United Nations announced this week. "I can't think of any issue that is more important than working to see that no schoolchild in this world goes hungry," Barrymore said in a statement Wednesday. "Feeding a child at school is such a simple thing, but it works miracles. I've seen it with my own eyes." Barrymore joins marathoner Paul Tergat as an ambassador. Tergat, from Kenya, benefited from school meal programs as a child, then won the New York City marathon in 2005. Founded in 1962, WFP provides food aid to an average of 90 million poor people, including 58 million hungry children in at least 80 of the world's poorest countries. The United States said it provides nearly half the annual contributions to the Rome-based agency, which has an annual budget of just under $3 billion. Barrymore is advocating legislation in Congress to increase money for school meals from $100 million per year to about $300 million per year within five years.

"The problem with these things where you're working with them on film is (the) studio is very hot and you're in that atmosphere, they just stick to your eyes," the 46-year-old actor said. "You get constant drops and stuff." "28 Weeks Later" is the sequel to 2002's "28 Days Later." Six months have passed since the "rage" virus wiped out London. Carlyle stars as a man who survived the plague that decimated Britain and now is among survivors in a fortified area of London guarded by U.S. troops supervising the country's repopulation. Carlyle said it didn't bother him that none of the actors in the original movie are in the sequel. "That's a good thing in a sense because the film can stand on its own, you know," he told reporters recently. "I think that if people enjoyed the first film, they'll certainly enjoy this one, I'm sure." Carlyle's screen credits also include "Trainspotting," "The Full Monty" and "The Beach."

Moore, who made the hit documentary "Fahrenheit 9/11" assailing President Bush's handling of Sept. 11, said in a letter to U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on Friday that the White House may have opened the investigation for political reasons. "For five and a half years, the Bush administration has ignored and neglected the heroes of the 9/11 community," Moore said in the letter, which he posted on the liberal Web site Daily Kos. "These heroic first responders have been left to fend for themselves, without coverage and without care. "I understand why the Bush administration is coming after me - I have tried to help the very people they refuse to help, but until George W. Bush outlaws helping your fellow man, I have broken no laws and I have nothing to hide." Harvey Weinstein, whose Weinstein Co. is releasing "Sicko," told The Associated Press the movie is a "healing film" that could bring opponents together over the ills of America's health-care system. "This time, we didn't want the fight, because the movie unites both sides," Weinstein said. "We've shown the movie to Republicans. Both sides of the bench love the film. The pharmaceutical industry won't like the movie. HMOs will try to run us out of town, but that's not relevant to the situation. "The whole campaign this time was not to be incendiary. It was, can Michael Moore bring both sides together?" The health-care industry Moore skewers in "Sicko" was a major contributor to Bush's 2004 re-election campaign and to Republican candidates over the last four years, Moore wrote. "I can understand why that industry's main recipient of its contributions - President Bush - would want to harass, intimidate and potentially prevent this film from having its widest possible audience," Moore wrote. Treasury officials in Washington said Friday they would have no comment on the contents of Moore's letter, citing a policy against discussing specific investigations being conducted by Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control, the agency that enforces the trade embargo against Cuba. "Generally speaking, as administrators and enforcers of U.S. sanctions, OFAC is required to investigate potential violations of these programs," Treasury spokeswoman AnnMarie Hauser said. "In doing so, OFAC issues hundreds of letters each year asking for additional information when possible sanctions violations have occurred." OFAC notified Moore in a letter dated May 2 that it was conducting a civil investigation for possible violations of the U.S. trade embargo restricting travel to Cuba. Moore questioned the timing of the investigation, noting that "Sicko" premieres May 19 at the Cannes Film Festival and debuts in U.S. theaters June 29. The Bush administration knew of his plans to travel to Cuba since last October, said Moore, who went there in March with about 10 ailing workers involved in the rescue effort at the World Trade Center ruins. Weinstein said the investigation would only help publicize the film. "The timing is amazing. You would think that we originated this. It reads like a fiction best-seller," Weinstein said. The Weinstein Co. said it has hired David Boies, the chief attorney in Al Gore's recount battle against Bush in the 2000 presidential election, to help on the "Sicko" case. Cuba on Friday characterized Moore as a victim of censorship and the U.S. trade embargo. The Communist Party daily Granma called the 45-year-old U.S. travel and trade sanctions "a criminal action that has cost lives and grave consequences for the inhabitants of the island," as well as Americans. "Any resemblance to McCarthyism is no coincidence," the newspaper opined, referring to the political witch hunt that U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy carried out against suspected American communists in the 1950s. The U.S. government's targeting of Moore "confirms the imperial philosophy of censorship" by American officials, it added. U.S. State Department officials on Friday declined to comment on Granma's criticisms of the American government and referred calls to the Treasury Department. OFAC's letter to Moore noted that he had applied in October 2006 for permission as a full-time journalist to travel to Cuba, but that the agency had not made any determination on his request. The agency gave Moore 20 business days to provide details on his Cuba trip and the names of those who accompanied him. Moore won an Academy Award for best documentary with his 2002 gun-control film "Bowling for Columbine" and scolded Bush in his Oscar acceptance speech as the war in Iraq was just getting under way. The investigation has given master promoter Moore another jolt of publicity just before the release of one of his films. "Fahrenheit 9/11" premiered at Cannes in 2004 amid a public quarrel between Moore and the Walt Disney Co., which refused to let subsidiary Miramax release the film because of its political content. Miramax bosses Harvey and Bob Weinstein ended up releasing the film on their own and later left to form the Weinstein Co., distributor of "Sicko." "This is `Fahrenheit' all over again. `Let's pressure somebody.' Last time it was Disney, this time it's direct," Harvey Weinstein said. "Fahrenheit 9/11" won the top prize at Cannes and went on to become the top-grossing documentary ever with $119 million.

"You're just gonna kill me, you know I have a heart condition. You're just gonna kill me," the CBS' "Late Show" host said Wednesday night. The 20-year-old actress said the audience will be seeing "a lot" of her in the "really dark, scary film." Lohan also said she took lessons for the role. "It's really difficult to get yourself up there," she said. Lohan was at a loss for words when Letterman talked about her "Georgia Rule" co-star Jane Fonda. Last year, Fonda praised a studio executive's scolding of Lohan for her absences on the set of the movie. "You're 20, Jane Fonda is 70 for god's sakes and looks just tremendous, and more than looks great, has this palpable sense of vitality," Letterman said. "It radiates." Lohan was silent for a moment, then replied: "She does, no, she's amazing." "Georgia Rule," also starring Felicity Huffman, was to open in theaters Friday.

Photo / Dean Purcell Effect of Australia's lower limit shortlived Bringing booze level down 'will save 14 lives a year' State of drinker shocks families Drink-drive message just not getting through Family suffer two drink-drive calamities Psychologist advocates zero limit Men would have to cut their drinking in half, and women by two-thirds, if they wanted to drink and drive under the new limits proposed by the police. Guidelines in Australia, where all states have adopted the proposed limit of 50mg of alcohol for every 100ml of blood since the 1980s, say that men can drink only two "standard drinks", and women only one drink, in the first hour of drinking before going over the limit. The current New Zealand limit of 80mg per 100ml allows men up to four drinks, and women up to three, in the first hour. Both limits allow up to one further drink an hour if you keep on drinking after the first hour. The maths is approximate. The head of the New Zealand section of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians' addiction medicine chapter, Professor Ross McCormick, says the amount you can drink depends on your weight, how much your body has got used to drinking, and how much you have eaten. "If you are heavier, you tend to be able to store more alcohol in your body," he said. A bigger person can drink more than a small one. "The ability to detoxify also varies depending on how used to alcohol you are, so you can detoxify a little bit faster if you become a higher alcohol drinker. "And if you had a big meal with four standard drinks, you'd have a lower blood alcohol content because it takes longer to absorb. The advice is that anybody who drinks up to that limit should have a meal with it to ensure that the blood alcohol content is lower than it would otherwise be." A "standard drink" contains 10g of alcohol - roughly the amount of alcohol that the body can absorb out of the blood in an hour. If you have four standard drinks in the first hour, or one every 15 minutes, that means you might have absorbed three-quarters of the first drink by the end of the hour so you will still have about 32.5g of alcohol in your blood. In a "standard" 64kg person with 4.4 litres of blood in their body, that's 74mg for every 100ml of blood. A fifth drink would put you over the 80mg limit. If you have only two standard drinks in the first hour, or one every 30 minutes, your body might have absorbed only half of the first drink by the end of the hour so you would still have 15g of alcohol in your blood. For the same "standard" person, that's 34mg for every 100ml of blood and a third drink would put you over the proposed 50mg limit. Professor McCormick said the College of Physicians supported a 50mg limit because that was the point at which most people's brains started to fuzz over. "The number of drinks you can have with the current limit is actually quite high. If I took four in the first hour, I'd be feeling quite woolly in the head," he said. "If I take two, I'm actually quite clear." The college says a driver with 50mg of alcohol in every 100ml of their blood is twice as likely to crash as one with no alcohol - but one with 80mg of alcohol is seven times more likely to crash. "In any exponential risk curve the curve starts to take off, and by the time you get to 80mg per 100ml it's at the bottom of the part where the risk goes straight up," the professor said. Sixteen of the 30 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) now have drink-driving limits of 50mg per 100ml of blood. Only six others besides New Zealand (Britain, Ireland, Luxembourg, Canada, Mexico and the US) still have a limit of 80mg. Four have limits of 20mg or 30mg, and three have zero tolerance of any alcohol in a driver's blood at all. Apart from New Zealand, only the US has a separate limit for young people (20mg for people under 21, the US drinking age). But Australia, Canada, and Spain have lower limits (10mg-30mg) for new drivers (counted as "youth" in the table). Even New Zealand's existing 30mg limit for drivers under 20 is considered so low that even a single standard drink would put most people over the limit.

Photo / Greg Bowker Effect of Australia's lower limit shortlived Police aim to restrict drinks for the road State of drinker shocks families Drink-drive message just not getting through Family suffer two drink-drive calamities Psychologist advocates zero limit Breath and blood alcohol limits should be drastically cut, says NZ's top traffic policeman. National road policing manager Superintendent Dave Cliff says the country's limits are out of step with those of other nations. And, he says, a lower limit will help reduce the 30 per cent of road deaths caused by drink drivers. He believes lower breath and blood alcohol limits will save at least 14 lives a year. Test results made public yesterday revealed repeat drink driver Gordon Armstrong was significantly over the limit when he killed himself and three motorcyclists near Rotorua on April 29. "We're still seeing lives being needlessly lost because of repeat drink drivers," Mr Cliff said. "I think New Zealand needs to lift its game another rung. We shouldn't be out of step with the rest of the world." The Government has twice decided against lowering the limits since 2003, despite acknowledging driver performance starts to fall well below the present levels. But Transport Safety Minister Harry Duynhoven and representatives of the other main political parties said they supported more discussion on the issue. Mr Cliff said New Zealand's limits of 400 micrograms per litre of breath and 80mg per 100ml of blood were "extraordinarily high". "For the families of the 130 killed last year by drunk drivers, the price that we're paying, that all of us are paying, through the deaths and through the maimings each year, is an enormous price." He proposes cutting levels to 250mcg per litre of breath and 50mg per 100ml of blood to bring New Zealand into line with Australia and "best-performing" European countries. He would like "virtual zero alcohol" for youths under 20. A Ministry of Transport report, commissioned in 2004, says the move would also prevent 260 injuries annually. Cutting the youth limit would save one life and 26 injuries. Land Transport and the Alcohol Advisory Council say there are too many variables to say exactly how much alcohol people can drink before they reach today's limit, but Mr Cliff said it took "a significant amount" and the risk of fatal crashes increased exponentially. At the 400mcg breath limit, the risk was eight times that of a sober person. At 250mcg, the risk was only twice as high. Mr Cliff said compelling evidence overseas, particularly in Australia, supported a reduction. Australia has had a 14 per cent drop in alcohol-related crashes since the 1980s, when it lowered the blood-alcohol limit to 50mg - the upper limit recommended by the World Health Organisation. Mr Cliff said the best-performing European countries had a 50mg limit or less. The United States, which has the same limit as New Zealand, has a poor road-safety record. In the Czech Republic, where drivers cannot drink at all, only 4.8 per cent of road deaths result from drink-driving. Australian drivers caught with breath alcohol levels between 250mcg and 400mcg receive infringement notices or a short disqualification, and the same was envisaged for New Zealand, Mr Cliff said. Senior Sergeant Ed Van Broek, officer in charge of the Armstrong case and head of the Rotorua traffic unit, said there was widespread support among police for lowering the limits because officers often stopped drivers who recorded breath alcohol below the limit but were too drunk to drive. Among political parties, only the Greens voiced outright support for Mr Cliff's proposal, saying they would be happy with a blood limit lower than 50mg. National and NZ First were open to further discussion, and the Maori Party wanted broader talks about alcohol abuse.

http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10439312&ref=rss	'Moral panic' over obesity - 12 May 2007 - NZ Herald: New Zealand National news Visit the homepage" class="sat"> The New Zealand Herald: Saturday May 12, 2007 'Moral panic' over obesity Saturday May 12, 2007 What does it tell us if 5-year-olds in our society would prefer to lose an arm than be fat? Waikato University sociologist Natalie Cowley, who asks that question in a new thesis, also provides an answer: it tells us that we have developed an unhealthy "moral panic" about fatness. Ms Cowley, 37, a mother of two children aged 14 and 11, says there is nothing wrong with being fat, as such. It's not weight that makes poor people unhealthy, but their life experiences including "the types of high fat/sugar, calorie-dense foods that tend to figure largely in an impoverished diet". "As children are getting fatter and fatter, look at what's happening to make them fatter," she says. "Don't blame the child. They bear the brunt of it. They are the ones that have to grow up being taunted in the schoolyard, when it is society and the consumption practices around them that are really to blame." She quotes American studies which have found that 5-year-olds would rather lose an arm than be fat, that weight-loss surgery patients would rather be blind, deaf or lose a limb than be fat again, and that 11 per cent of the public would abort a foetus if they found out that it had a genetic tendency to fatness. "Children seem to be a lot more aware now of what's healthy and what's not, but it doesn't mean they are necessarily getting thinner," she says. "When people focus on children in particular, they are saying to children who might be a little bit overweight: 'God, you are unattractive and unhealthy.' "I don't think that's healthy. It can be counter-productive because dieting can make you fatter in the long run." Her 135-page master's thesis traces Western attitudes to fatness back to Plato, who considered that the body's need for food was a "distraction" from pure thought. Later, Christians such as St Augustine saw the "slimy desires of the flesh" as the enemy of devotion to God and others. These attitudes were reinforced by the growth of capitalism, which saw the human body as a machine which should be "as efficient, as effective, as economical and as beautiful as the sleek new machines". "Hence, implicit in all reports on the 'obesity epidemic', and in all weight-loss-related literature, TV programmes and advertising, is an unstated, often unrealised moral agenda," says Ms Cowley in her thesis. "It is not simply a matter of concern for the health of a nation, or even concern for its economic growth, but fears about its moral degeneracy." She accepts that extreme obesity may be unhealthy. "I wouldn't want my children to be unhealthy, and of course I wouldn't want them to be what is called 'morbidly obese'," she says. But she says the body mass index (BMI), developed by the insurance industry, "fails to take into account the considerable and natural variations in human body size and shape which are not in themselves detrimental to health". Current BMI tables class anyone with a BMI of 25 to 30 as "overweight" and anyone above 30 as "obese". Yet a Norwegian study which followed 1.8 million people for 10 years found that those with the highest life expectancy had BMIs between 26 and 28 - all supposedly "overweight". "The lowest life expectancy was not found among those in the 'obese' category, but rather among those with a BMI below 18. "People of both Italy and Greece have the honour of being the most overweight people in Europe, yet experience the lowest rates of heart disease and one of the highest rates of longevity - a situation frequently attributed to olive oil," Ms Cowley writes. In the US, she says, African-American women see food and fatness as "a symbol of love, nurturance, sharing, survival, substance, fertility, health and prosperity". "From my own experience with the Maori community - and I have had quite a bit to do with it because my children are Maori themselves - there is a different attitude [compared with Pakeha] towards food, and there is a different attitude towards the body which comes from that," Ms Cowley says. "There is more communal sharing of food and there is not such a push to fit into a narrowly defined body shape. "Instead of focusing on the eradication of fat, health authorities and governments alike should turn their attention to the alleviation of poverty, a move that will facilitate healthier, empowered eating habits," she writes.

http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10439317&ref=rss	Lawyer who lost case will decide on Bain retrial - 12 May 2007 - NZ Herald: New Zealand National news Visit the homepage" class="sat"> The New Zealand Herald: Saturday May 12, 2007 Lawyer who lost case will decide on Bain retrial Saturday May 12, 2007 David Bain - bail hearing on Tuesday Campaigner feels bitter-sweet relief Decision provokes calls to reinstate the Privy Council The final decision on whether David Bain will face a new murder trial rests with the man who lost the Crown's case at the Privy Council in London, Solicitor-General David Collins, QC. And while Bain's legal team is putting its hope in an early release for Bain next Tuesday at a bail hearing, the Privy Council judgment emphatically states that "the appellant [Bain] must remain in custody meanwhile". Dr Collins' Crown Law Office refused to comment yesterday on when a decision about a retrial would be made or how it would be made but it will involve close consultation with the police. And any decisions on whether Bain should get compensation - if he walks free - would ultimately be the Cabinet's. But the Government will not be consulted by its top legal officer over whether there should be a retrial, Attorney-General Michael Cullen said yesterday: "The decision is solely for the Solicitor-General to make." contacted yesterday believed Dr Collins would order one given that the murders occurred 13 years ago. But some believed Crown Law would order a retrial to show it was right all along and to restore some confidence in the justice system badly shaken by the Privy Council decision to quash Bain's five murder convictions and implicitly criticise the Court of Appeal for not having ordered a retrial earlier. Crown Law has its own established guidelines for determining whether to prosecute but they are sufficiently broad to justify a decision either way. Two main criteria for prosecution are:* Sufficient evidence.* In the public interest. The criteria for determining whether a prosecution is in the public interest include: * The effect of a decision not to prosecute. * The staleness of the offence. * Whether prosecution might make the accused a martyr. * The likely length and expense of the trial. Bain's bail hearing is scheduled for Tuesday at 2.15pm in the High Court at Christchurch. Bain's lawyer, Michael Reed, QC, said his client was entitled to bail. "His convictions have been quashed so he's like anyone accused of a crime. He's not guilty unless proved guilty." Asked if he expected bail to be opposed, Mr Reed said: "I have no idea but if they do oppose it, it would be outrageous." Detective Superintendent Malcolm Burgess would not comment on whether police would oppose bail. "Police would have a significant input into any decision around bail. We would take into account all those things listed in the Bail Act." The legislation lists, among other things, the likelihood to offend while on bail as a factor that might prevent bail being granted. Mr Burgess said the police would meet Crown Law staff to discuss the evidence. "We'll be making an assessment on what witnesses and what evidence are available to assist the Crown in reaching its decision," Mr Burgess said. "I know people have said that witnesses [from the original trial] have died. I'm not personally aware of that - and until we've gone through the exercise of determining the state of the evidence, we won't know the answer," he said. Dunedin Crown Solicitor Robin Bates, who was involved in the original trial but not in the appeals, believed he would be consulted over a possible retrial. He did not know if any evidence in the original trial would no longer be available for a retrial, but was aware of reports that some witnesses had died. "Even from the vague recollection I have of the events, I do not know who they are referring to, but that will obviously come out in due course." Former MP Stephen Franks, who has returned to practising law, said yesterday that if Dr Collins was thinking of the interests of his "client", the Government, "he would say, 'Let it rest'." That was because of the expense, and because of the doubt there would always be over holding a trial at such distance in time from the killings. "I can't see an interest-of-justice purpose served by putting a spurious finality over it now." Wellington barrister Greg King believes Crown Law will be under pressure to demonstrate that "they got it right the first time". "They will be wanting to say that the man who spent 13 years in jail was a guilty man," he said on One News last night. "I think those pressures are real and I think they should not be underestimated." The decision by Solicitor-General David Collins to run the David Bain case himself at the Privy Council in London raised a few eyebrows in Wellington. The view of insiders after he returned was that the case had not run as well as it might have in the hands of a criminal law expert. Well before the judgment was released on Thursday night, Crown Law had been bracing itself for a loss. Dr Collins made his reputation as a litigator in the legal medical field. In the 10 months since he started as Solicitor-General, Dr Collins has earned a reputation for being a hands-on litigator who prefers to run big cases himself rather than to delegate. He represented the Crown in the case involving the release of Family Court documents around the kidnapping of Hamilton boy Jayden Headley. Crown Law spokeswoman Jan Fulstow said he had four cases lined up in the Supreme Court but they were not high-profile ones. The most high-profile cases by Dr Collins' predecessor, Terence Arnold, QC, were representing the Crown at the foreshore and seabed hearings and whether Ahmed Zaoui should be kept in jail while his security status is determined.

Gull started the war by offering 5c off a litre of petrol until 7pm today. Shell and Caltex quickly followed by reducing the price of petrol by 6c a litre. Then BP offered a 7c a litre discount on top of supermarket dockets for the entire weekend.

http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10439311&ref=rss	A white wedding like no other - 12 May 2007 - NZ Herald: New Zealand National news Visit the homepage" class="sat"> The New Zealand Herald: Saturday May 12, 2007 A white wedding like no other Saturday May 12, 2007 Miss Pizza marries Mr Meat Pie in the promotional mock wedding. Photo / Richard Robinson The bride in white, the groom in his best bib and tucker and the vicar in his robes, standing framed by the arched stained-glass windows of the stone Anglican chapel. So far, so normal. But forget the traditional vision of a wedding - this is a vastly different story. It is one of sacred vows sold for commercial gain - the bride and groom are a pizza and a pie, and the service is a commercial product launch in which the only authentic ingredient is the venue. Now, St Matthew-in-the-City in Auckland Central is under fire for taking its community outreach and fundraising drives a step too far. Lyndsay Freer, director of Catholic Communications, said such events made a mockery of religion. "Certainly in a Catholic church we would not allow it to be used for a commercial purpose of that kind." A spokeswoman for a North Shore Christian group, who did not want to be named, said the group did not agree with drinking inside the church. But St Matthew's has a policy of opening its doors for events and all it asks for is a donation. Last year, the church made $130,000 from hosting 52 events, including weddings. The average donation is about $1500 an event. Vicar Glynn Cardy defends its policy. "It's not bringing the church into any disrepute or walking over any sacred ceremonies. "Our approach is that we are there for the community and we are keen that people can come in and enjoy the space, not just for worship. "Yes, St Matthew's is a sacred place, but we believe sacred is not restricted to church things. There is something sacred in doing crazy things, and laughter." Anglican bishop Richard Randerson supports Mr Cardy's view. Last year, St Matthew's hosted a champagne launch with pews cleared for a lit-up disco dance floor, with trapeze artists writhing overhead and flutes clinking in the aisles. It also co-hosts with the SPCA an annual service for animals. A function for music station Juice TV had a bar. But yesterday's fake match for a fast-food company took the cake. Miss Pizza was walked down the aisle to wed Mr Meat Pie before an actor dressed as a vicar. The happy couple exchanged vows and rings - a pea and a pineapple. It was all in aid of a new flavour of pizza being introduced by the Domino's chain. The pizza creator, Louise Turner, said the idea of the ceremony was fantastic. "I like that it's a play on the words 'Meat pie marries the Pizza'." Mr Cardy said: "It's just a bit of fun. We do some bizarre things. People can't take things like this too seriously." But he said St Matthew's does have boundaries - it would never host anything objectionable or offensive and it does not tolerate "hate groups".

http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10439330&ref=rss	Private school dumps 'girl friendly' NCEA - 12 May 2007 - NZ Herald: New Zealand National news Visit the homepage" class="sat"> The New Zealand Herald: Saturday May 12, 2007 Private school dumps 'girl friendly' NCEA Saturday May 12, 2007 Exclusive Wellington boys school Scots College has decided to drop NCEA, saying it tends to favour girls. Headmaster Graeme Yule said NCEA lent itself to the girls, who tended to be more diligent with the internal assessment aspects of NCEA. Mr Yule told The Dominion Post Scots College would spend $150,000 a year to roll out the International Baccalaureate programme to offer students an alternative. He said girls had received more help since the 1980s to succeed in education and NCEA lent itself to those advancements. Mr Yule said boys were more pragmatic and did just enough to pass, whereas girls were more mature in their study habits. "We made a decision as a college a number of years ago that we would, as a New Zealand school, offer a New Zealand curriculum but we have reached a tipping point where we feel enough's enough," he said. Several other private schools have dumped NCEA , which was brought in to replace the old School Certificate and University Entrance examinations. Education Minister Steve Maharey said he was reluctant to be drawn into the debate as it was not relevant to him. Scots College was a private school and could make its own decisions, he said. Nelson College for Girls principal Alison McAlpine said while it was possible that the more diligent girls did fared better with NCEA, they were qualities that were important for any student.

http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10439313&ref=rss	State of drinker shocks families - 12 May 2007 - NZ Herald: New Zealand National news Visit the homepage" class="sat"> The New Zealand Herald: Saturday May 12, 2007 State of drinker shocks families Saturday May 12, 2007 Effect of Australia's lower limit shortlived Police aim to restrict drinks for the road Bringing booze level down 'will save 14 lives a year' Drink-drive message just not getting through Family suffer two drink-drive calamities Psychologist advocates zero limit Gordon Armstrong, the repeat drink-driver who killed three motorcyclists near Rotorua on April 29, was "significantly" over the legal alcohol limit when he crashed. Police yesterday revealed that Armstrong, 53, had a blood-alcohol level 12mg higher than the limit of 80mg per 100ml of blood, but said his actual reading was likely to have been much higher. A blood sample was taken from Armstrong four hours after his car crossed the centre line and ploughed into motorcyclists Simon Short, Toni Dommerholt-Purchase and Leon Mason. Senior Sergeant Ed Van Den Broek of Rotorua said the time lapse, the result of emergency medical treatment Armstrong received at the scene, as well as replacement blood fluids he was given, would have diluted the sample. Police now believe Armstrong had drunk through the night and was still drinking in the daylight hours before he left Putaruru at 11am and hit the motorcyclists about an hour later on State Highway 33. His 5-year-old son and two grand-daughters, aged 7 and 8, were with him in the car when it crashed and were injured. Armstrong died a day after the collision. Mr Van Den Broek said it was impossible to estimate Armstrong's true blood-alcohol level, but the fact he was over the limit four hours later and his erratic driving suggested it was "significantly higher". The families of Armstrong's victims reacted with horror to the blood results. "My family, friends and I can never forgive or forget the devastation and the horror caused at the hands of this man," said Mr Mason's widow, Jos. She said it was obvious Armstrong did not care for himself, his family or "three strangers enjoying a Sunday morning ride", and she criticised his family's "irresponsibility" in allowing him to drive. "We would be horrified to think that the family, knowing his history, knew he had been drinking, with their children in the car." She thanked emergency workers and other motorists who stopped to help her husband and his friends, but said she and her family did not support the police proposal to lower driver alcohol limits. "It won't make a blind bit of difference because these drunk drivers, they're a different breed. They don't care, they're going to drink anyway ... We believe there should be zero tolerance and harsher penalties and deterrents put in place." Mrs Mason is setting up a website dedicated to her husband and hopes to have it online by the end of next week. The site will begin with tributes but will be used to campaign against drink-driving, she said. Armstrong's family did not wish to comment on his blood-alcohol results or the claim that they had been irresponsible.

Photo / Chris Skelton A fire which engulfed much of an old theatre in Auckland's Queen St early this morning is being treated as suspicious. Up to 16 appliances and about 75 Fire Service staff attended the two-floor fire at the old Odeon Theatre, next to the St James, which was so intense that visors on firefighters' helmets began to melt. Auckland Central senior station officer Chris Scott said the former cinema was not used much these days apart from occasional dance parties and no events were staged there when the fire began. "We can't think why it would have started. There was no reason why it should have started by itself," he said. "I know there has been problems there in recent days with vagrants and the investigators will be looking at that and a number of other factors." Fire Service staff were first notified about the blaze about 3.45am. Mr Scott said it didn't appear significant at first but once firefighters worked their way to the backstage area it became obvious reinforcements were needed. "We had real issues with heat there and the visors on the helmets were beginning to melt," Mr Scott said. "We were lucky we have these new hoods that we can use which keeps the temperatures down on the bodies. A year ago this would have been much more difficult to manage. "Even with all that, it was five minutes away from engulfing the rest of the building." The fire was largely under control by 7am and remaining crews were looking after hot spots. Fire safety officers were investigating the cause. Theatre manager John Griffiths said it was business as usual, and once the insurance assessors came in on Monday, repairs would begin. Mr Griffiths said firefighters did a great job in containing the blaze and everyone was relieved the main St James Theatre was not damaged at all.

Paul Paulo, 31, was charged with wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and possession of an offensive weapon. He was remanded in custody after a brief appearance in the Wellington District Court today and is due to re-appear on May 16. Police said yesterday's incident appeared to be the result of tensions between Black Power and Mongrel Mob gang members. Wellington area commander Inspector Greg Gilpin said security concerns were raised by the issue and police would work to address them. The victim needed treatment to a cut on the back of his neck.

http://www.nzherald.co.nz/index.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10439301&ref=rss	Decision provokes calls to reinstate the Privy Council - 12 May 2007 - NZ Herald: New Zealand National news Visit the homepage" class="sat"> The New Zealand Herald: Saturday May 12, 2007 Decision provokes calls to reinstate the Privy Council Saturday May 12, 2007 Lawyer who lost case will decide on Bain retrial Campaigner feels bitter-sweet relief David Bain's QC does not believe New Zealand's justice system has failed - but he is urging National to bring back the Privy Council if it wins the next election. Michael Reed said it was "quite usual" for judges to be overturned by a higher authority and that was what the appeal system was for. But he thinks the higher authority should reside with the Privy Council in London, not the new New Zealand Supreme Court. He conceded it was possible the Supreme Court would have ruled exactly the same as the Privy Council in overturning the Court of Appeal's refusal to give his client a retrial. "All I'm saying is I much prefer to go to the Privy Council because I think they are taken from a pool of 60 million people as against four million," Mr Reed said. "I sincerely hope National will reinstate the Privy Council. They were against getting rid of it so they ought to reinstate it. The public are hugely in support of the Privy Council, the legal profession is in support and many judges are in support." But National leader John Key last night ruled out a policy to bring back the Privy Council, saying it would be too difficult to resurrect. However, he said the decision would have people "questioning the wisdom of abandoning the Privy Council". "New Zealand has put quite a lot of store in the fact there was always that final appellate court. "It just gave them a degree of confidence that, in the end, there was always someone divorced from the situation who could look at it." Chris Finlayson, the shadow attorney-general, said the passage of time made it almost impossible to return to the Privy Council. "The Supreme Court is well under way and I can't see, practically, how one can undo that. And do you do it on the basis of one case?" National Party associate justice spokesman Richard Worth said the Bain decision showed concerns about dumping the Privy Council were justified. "In New Zealand, it is a small profession and the judges are drawn from a small pool. They are competent but that's not the point. There is not the same opportunity for that dispassionate overview that is so important. This is the sort of stuff where you could say 'I told you so'." Others in the legal profession, though, say the Supreme Court should remain. Scott Optican, an associate law professor at Auckland University, said that New Zealand was perfectly capable of administering its own justice. "Just because cases get reversed doesn't mean there's anything wrong with the system." Though the Privy Council and the Court of Appeal ruled differently on virtually the same crown evidence, they simply came to different conclusions. This did not mean one was right and the other wrong, he said. Michael Guest, Bain's original lawyer, said the Court of Appeal had been rapped over the knuckles by the Privy Council five times in the past six years over miscarriages of justice, including when the New Zealand court denied victims of Michael Bottrill's botched cervical smears a punitive damages claim. The latest decision over Bain showed the Privy Council should be reinstated, said Mr Guest, who believes New Zealand is too small a country for judges not to be "subtly" and "unwittingly" influenced by a natural desire to protect the integrity of the police and the system. Auckland QC John Billington agreed the Court of Appeal had not followed the rules of law in Bain's case. But he said the Supreme Court was performing well and often overruled Court of Appeal cases. WHY the Privy Council quashed David Bain's murder conviction: 1) Robin Bain's mental state The jury did not know that Robin, a school principal, was "seriously disturbed" or that children at his school were writing sadistic stories, including one about the serial murder of family members. The jury did not know that Robin was facing claims of incest from his 18-year-old daughter, Laniet - a possible motive for murder. David's feet were about 20cm too big to match bloodstained sockprints found all over the house but the prints were the right size for Robin. 4) When computer was switched on The prosecution claimed the computer was switched on at exactly 6.44am - just after David returned from his paper round - but it might have been turned on earlier by Robin. 5) When David returned home A witness identified David returning home at 6.45am, possibly too late to have murdered his father. David said he was wearing his mother's glasses but the jury was wrongly told they were his own - an error which may have reduced his credibility in their eyes. 7) The misplaced lens The jury was told the left-hand lens from the glasses was found on the floor on Stephen's bedroom near his body - in fact it was lying under a skate boot and a jacket. 8) The bloody fingerprints David's fingerprints on the rifle may have been bloody from shooting rabbits or possums months earlier. The Privy Council said the Court of Appeal was wrong to dismiss defence claims that Laniet could have already been dead when David heard gurgling noises coming from her body.

In the Christchurch District Court, Shane Tristan Capstick admitted two charges of supplying a restricted substance, BZP, to a person aged under 18. Capstick was fined $350 on each charge, which carries a maximum penalty of a $2000 fine, The Press reported. It is the first conviction of the type in a prosecution brought by the Ministry of Health under the Misuse of Drugs Amendment Act 2005, in which BZP was classified as a class C drug, bringing it in line with cannabis. In March, a North Canterbury woman was charged similarly, but got police diversion on a charge of supplying BZP pills to a girl aged under 18.

Photo / Dean Purcell A man charged with murder after allegedly setting a 55-year-old alight in Auckland yesterday will spend the next two days under observation in prison. The 32-year-old unemployed man, who was listed as having no fixed address, was remanded in custody when he appeared at Auckland District Court today. He will spend the next two days at Auckland Central Remand Prison in Mt Eden under observation as he is regarded as a risk. The accused man was granted interim name suppression until his next court appearance on May 14. His appearance today follows the death of 55-year-old sickness beneficiary Colin Edward Moyle, in Kiwitea St, Sandringham, at about 5pm yesterday. Detective Inspector Bernie Hollewand said the alleged offender broke into the house when the deceased man was away yesterday afternoon. He said when Mr Moyle returned the offender attacked him in the doorway and threw boiling water at him. The victim ran out of the house but the offender followed and hit the victim a number of times with a spade. "The offender then splashed a flammable liquid on to the deceased and ignited it," Mr Hollewand said. The alleged offender was still at the scene when police, ambulance and fire service units arrived shortly afterwards, and the Mr Moyle's body was still burning. The first police officers who arrived at the scene in Kiwitea St just before 5pm had to douse the flames, and the body showed signs of other injuries. Neighbours said there was a history of disputes at the house. A woman who lives next door said she had just come home when she saw the man on fire. "I came back and [was] looking at fire on the body ... After that came the smell. I didn't know what happened." Another neighbour, Peter Hotere, said he went outside after hearing the commotion and police arriving. He saw one man lying face down on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back, and the dead man was on his back with a sheet covering his upper body. The top of the sheet was drenched in blood. Mr Hotere said some of his neighbours saw the incident unfolding. "Our neighbours told me that someone got bashed and then set on fire." Residents said they were not surprised to see police arrive in the street as they were always being called to fighting and problems at the house. "Once there was a smashed-up car outside our house and it was from their house and it was from fighting," said Mr Hotere. The people living at the house were recent arrivals. "The people are new. They just came into the area not long ago." Part of Kiwitea St was closed and residents were unable to get home while police investigated last night. Some 20 police staff are working on the case. - Additional reporting NZPA More by Elizabeth Binning Lowering booze level 'will save 14 lives a year' Lawyer who lost case will decide on Bain retrial 2:45PM St James theatre blaze treated as suspicious Murder accused held in prison after fiery death US continues to stall RNZAF skyhawks' sale Police name youth wanted over bottle attack One dead, another injured in Edgecumbe crash Stranded trampers flown out of Arthur's Pass Man in serious condition after Hamilton stabbing Man remanded after Wellington court stabbing Police officer released from hospital after assault Private school dumps 'girl friendly' NCEA First conviction for illegal supply of BZP Qantas suspends Adelaide flights Baby dies sleeping beside father - possibly of suffocation Study aimed at helping diabetes sufferers Tornadoes hit West Coast Police aim to restrict drinks for the road Decision provokes calls to reinstate the Privy Council New fuel price war erupts State of drinker shocks families 'Moral panic' over obesity A white wedding like no other Drink-drive message just not getting through True grit wins battle of the bulge Subscribe to the National RSS feed RSS allows you to subscribe and receive news directly to your computer. this media player requires Flash player version 6 or greater, click here to get Flash player Send us your news! send photos, videos & tip-offs to 021 YRNEWS (021 976 397) , or Subscribe to the print edition Book a Classified ad News Direct to You Digital Replica of Paper Letters to the Editor The New Zealand Herald: Copyright &copy;2007, APN Holdings NZ Limited NZH1Viper | 12 May 2007 16:06:15 | 2,344

Cookbook authors Margaret Fox and John Bear have devised an easy recipe for using cooked pasta in a frittata. (AP Photo/Larry Crowe) Finally, something to do with your leftover pasta. Cookbook authors Margaret Fox and John Bear have devised an easy recipe for using cooked pasta in a frittata, essentially an Italian omelet. They say any variety of noodle will do. Start to finish: 25 minutes 1 tablespoon olive oil 1/2 cup finely chopped onion 2 ounces pasta, cooked and chilled Salt and freshly ground black 2 large eggs, beaten 1 tablespoon grated dry cheese (such as Parmesan) Heat the oil in a medium nonstick pan over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saut&eacute; until golden, about 6 minutes. Transfer the onions to a small plate, leaving as much oil as possible in the pan. Set the onions aside. Add the pasta to the skillet, then season with salt and pepper and cook over medium heat until golden brown and crunchy. Return the onions to the pan. Mix well. Add the eggs, making sure they cover the noodles. Sprinkle the cheese over the eggs. Cover the pan and reduce heat to low. Cook for 1 minute. Remove the lid and place a large plate over the pan. Carefully flip the pan so the frittata lands on the plate. Return the pan to the stove and slide the frittata back into the pan to cook the other side for 1 minute. &ndash; The Associated Press The following are comments from the readers.

Use pasteurized eggs if you are concerned about eating uncooked eggs. The cake can be made 2 days in advance and refrigerated. The topping can be made up to 4 hours in advance, covered and refrigerated. The cake can be fully assembled up to 2 hours before serving. Adapted from &ldquo;Classic Stars Desserts,&rdquo; by Emily Luchetti (Chronicle, 2007). 3 ounces walnuts, toasted 4 ounces pecans, toasted 1/2 cup packed light brown sugar 4 ounces (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted and slightly cooled 6 ounces (1-1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature 1 cup heavy cream 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 cup heavy cream, well chilled For the crust: Have ready a 9-inch round springform pan. In the bowl of a food processor, combine the nuts, brown sugar and cinnamon; pulse until coarsely chopped. Transfer to a medium bowl and add the melted butter, stirring to moisten evenly. Press the mixture evenly into the bottom of the pan and refrigerate for 30 minutes. For the filling: Put the chocolate in a heatproof bowl and place it over a pan with an inch or two of barely boiling water over medium heat. While the chocolate is melting, put the butter and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer and beat on medium speed for about 1 minute, until smooth. Switch to a whisk attachment and add the eggs 2 at a time, beating well to incorporate after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl as necessary. Increase the speed to medium-high and beat for about 2 minutes. (The mixture may look slightly curdled.) Take off the heat and stir until smooth and slightly cooled but still warm. With the mixer on low speed, add the chocolate to the sugar-egg mixture, scraping the sides of the bowl as necessary, until the chocolate is well incorporated. Add the cream and vanilla extract and mix well. Spread the thick filling over the crust; cover with plastic wrap (the wrap should not touch the surface) and refrigerate about 3 hours, or until firm. For the topping: In a bowl, whisk together the cream and sugar until soft peaks form. Cover and refrigerate until serving, or spread directly on the refrigerated cake. To serve, run a hot, dry knife around the inside edge of the pan to loosen the cake, then transfer it to a serving platter. Slice with a hot, dry knife; serve chilled.

Snow peas are sliced into slivers to take the place of pasta. From Michel Richard&rsquo;s recently published cookbook &ldquo;Happy in the Kitchen&rdquo; (Artisan, 2006). 12 ounces snow peas 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth or stock, store-bought or homemade 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 3 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese Trim the tips and stem ends from the snow peas. Stack a couple of peas at a time and, with a very sharp knife, cut them lengthwise into the thinnest possible julienne (very thin strips); this should yield about 4 cups. Discard the snow pea strings. Combine the snow peas, chicken stock or broth, butter and salt in a medium saucepan.

The recipe&rsquo;s prep time is cut in half if you buy tail-on shrimp that are already deveined. The &ldquo;minute marinade&rdquo; becomes a dipping sauce. Oakland cooking teacher Ruta Kahate devised the recipe when she hosted a five-minute cooking segment for a local television station in California several years ago. To grill the shrimp, use wooden skewers that have been soaked in water for 30 minutes. Skewer the shrimp, draining and reserving the marinade, and grill them over high heat until just cooked through. Baste with the marinade occasionally. Serve with crusty bread and a salad. Adapted from Kahate&rsquo;s just-published &ldquo;5 Spices, 50 Dishes: Simple Indian Recipes Using Five Common Spices&rdquo; (Chronicle, 2007). 3 to 4 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice (from 1 lemon) 3 to 4 medium cloves garlic, finely minced 1/4 cup canola oil 2 tablespoons finely chopped cilantro leaves 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon cayenne 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon ground turmeric 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt 1-1/2 pounds large shell-on shrimp In a nonplastic (nonstaining) bowl, combine the lemon juice, garlic, 2 tablespoons of the oil, cilantro, cayenne pepper to taste, turmeric and salt. (Some frozen shrimp are salted, so remember to take that into account.) Stir well and taste; the marinade should be tangy and spicy. Set aside. Rinse and shell the shrimp, leaving the tails on, then devein them. Add them to the marinade as you work, and toss to coat evenly. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil to a large skillet and heat over high heat until the oil is smoking. Add the shrimp and marinade. Stir or toss the shrimp several times, then cover the skillet to keep the marinade from evaporating. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, or until the shrimp are just opaque. Transfer to a platter, pouring any remaining juices over. Serve hot or at room temperature.

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/273632	Mexican trucks to enter farther into Ariz., U.S. More E. Valley Local Coverage Mexican trucks to enter farther into Ariz., U.S. May. 10, 2007 10:46 AM The day may be nearing when Mexican trucks will carry freight deep into Arizona and other states for the first time in a generation. That prospect has rekindled controversy over the safety of Mexican trucks, the fairness of international trade agreements and the effectiveness of border security efforts. The latest round of debates comes as the U.S. government prepares to open up the southern border to 100 Mexican trucking firms as part of a one-year experiment. Critics of the plan to allow trucks beyond a 25-mile commercial zone range from public safety advocates to independent truckers and unions. They say it will unleash a flood of poorly regulated trucks onto American highways, threatening jobs of U.S. truckers and the lives of everyday drivers. Supporters come from much of the trucking industry, the Bush administration and many in Congress who favor the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. They say that the Mexican trucks will be tightly regulated to meet U.S. standards and that letting them pass beyond the zone will save U.S. consumers hundreds of millions of dollars. Mexican trucks crossed over the border 4.5 million times last year. In Arizona, the Nogales port of entry, the busiest, saw 288,000 of the state's 368,000 inbound crossings. Since 1982, trucks have had to stop within the buffer zone and transfer their loads to U.S. truckers to take them into the country. The new regulations would allow Mexican drivers to take their loads from Mexico to any point within the country. New rules in July It looks as if the new rules will take effect in July, says the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, the agency in the U.S. Department of Transportation that regulates trucking. Many close to the industry share the assessment, based on recent promises by the Mexican government. The 32 federal truck inspectors working inside Mexico have certified the safety procedures of 27 trucking firms. That comprises roughly 150 trucks. "During this pilot program, it's going to be very light. It will be hard to find a long-haul truck for a while," agency Administrator John Hill said. Mexico's Senate has balked at the program amid objections from Mexican trucking association CANACAR. The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has sued to block the plan. Joan Claybrook, president of Public Citizen, a non-profit consumer advocacy group, testified before the U.S. Senate two months ago that the U.S. truck safety agency is ill-equipped to regulate Mexican trucks. She cited U.S. government audits and reviews that show the agency inspected fewer than 2 percent of U.S. firms, that safety records on Mexican trucks were alarming and that one in six Mexican truck drivers has no logbooks and one in four no valid driver's licenses. "DOT asks that we nevertheless suspend belief and good judgment and accept on faith that the trucking companies from Mexico hand-picked to participate in the so called 'pilot program' will be radically different," Claybrook said. The U.S. truck safety agency says about 20 percent of Mexican trucks inspected are not up to U.S. standards. That is the same rate as U.S. trucks. Larry Woolson, chairman of the Arizona Trucking Association, says opponents of the plan have blown the concerns out of proportion. "There's a hysteria that all these trucks in Mexico are (junk). That's as racist a thing as I've ever heard," he said. "I don't buy this dangerous-truck thing at all because you've got good operators and bad operators in Mexico, just like in the U.S. I don't believe bad carriers will go through all this trouble." Hill said half of the 800 Mexican trucking firms vying to participate failed to pass a paperwork inspection. His agency has spent $500 million to bolster border inspections. State highway and transportation agencies, along with U.S. customs officials, say the influx of Mexican trucks will not change their work. Trucks will be pre-screened for compliance with safety, immigration and customs laws, and reinspected for safety compliance every three months. "We are ready," said Sydney DeModica, spokeswoman for the Arizona Department of Transportation's Motor Vehicle Division. "Of all the border states, we will probably have the least impact." The U.S. Transportation Department expects that 13 percent of the eligible Mexican trucks will enter in Arizona. Brian Levin, a Customs and Border Protection spokesman, says agents will continue to check every truck. Customs agents review in advance paperwork for the driver, the hauler and the load and inspect those that present a higher risk. Every vehicle passes through a radiation scanner, and at Nogales, those that warrant a closer look, about 28 percent, are sent to a secondary inspection station. Dogs, X-rays and gamma rays let inspectors check inside a truck without unloading it. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, ports of entry on the southern border saw lines of trucks backed up for miles. The efficiency of customs screening and longer-haul trucking is important to Arizona. Mexico is the state's largest foreign trade partner, accounting for $5.4 billion of exports last year, said Pati Urias, an Arizona Commerce Department spokeswoman. If U.S. authorities say they are ready, truckers such as Woolson are skeptical the Mexican government is. The border was to be opened under NAFTA, which was ratified in 1992. At various times since, government officials announced new regulations, only to be delayed. "I'm not holding my breath," he said, noting the Mexican government has been slow to get paperwork to U.S. carriers. "Already you see this going backwards."

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/273631	Drought may hurt outdoor fun More E. Valley Local Coverage Drought may hurt outdoor fun Special for The Republic May. 10, 2007 10:46 AM The fact that Arizona is beginning its 13th year of a drought is not much of a comfort to those who enjoy using the state's reservoirs for recreation. Low rainfall totals and snowpack runoff have prompted warnings of extreme summer fire danger. Fears of low lake levels are growing. Overall, the state's major reservoirs, particularly the ones on the Salt and Verde rivers, are expected to weather the summer in decent shape, according to water experts, but with some fluctuation. "The summer of 2005 was a spike year and brought us some respite, but it has been since 1995 that we have had a really wet year resulting in significant water releases," said Charlie Ester, manager of water resource operations for the Salt River Project. "Actually, currently we are riding the coattails of the heavy runoff from 2005." Anglers continue to reap the fishing benefits from the 2005 rains on lakes such as Roosevelt, Bartlett, Alamo and San Carlos, but the good times won't last forever. Depending on the weather patterns, the summer months could be tough ones for water-based recreation. Here is a rundown of what boaters and anglers can expect this summer at the state's major inland reservoirs: 41 percent full, 49 feet down from capacity. The situation is frustrating to some boaters who have found the lake's boat ramps are out of water. The lake is expected to be drawn down another 2 1/2 feet to allow crews to extend the main Jojoba boat ramp. Work is to start this month while water is being held in Horseshoe Lake upstream. At the end of the summer, Bartlett's level will be a few feet higher than it is now, at around 42 to 43 percent of capacity. 13 percent capacity, 58 feet down from capacity. Usually, this lake is dry at this time of year, but it is holding water until the boat ramp work is finished downstream at Bartlett Lake. After the work at Bartlett ramp, water will be released from Horseshoe, resulting in the lake being virtually drained. 63 percent full, 32 feet down from capacity. The lake level will go down another 15 feet to a level of just under 50 percent of capacity, Ester said. All ramps are expected to be usable throughout the summer. It is possible that the lake could rise if summer monsoon rains are plentiful. 89 percent full, 9 feet down from capacity. The level is expected to rise another 6 to 8 feet over the next month or two and remain at that level all summer. The lake fluctuates a few feet a day to accommodate the SRP pump-back system, which moves water back and forth between lakes. 94 percent full, 3 feet down from capacity. Canyon will remain full all summer until Oct. 1, when it will be taken down 50 feet for work on the dam. A fish habitat project, similar to the one done at Apache during a drawdown last year, is being considered. All recreational amenities are expected to be available. 93 percent full, 4 feet down from capacity. The level will stay within a few feet of the current level this summer, with the only fluctuation the result of operating the pump-back system. All recreational amenities are expected to be available. 91 percent full, 6 inches below capacity. Pleasant's level rises and falls with the inflow and outflow of Central Arizona Project water from the Colorado River. The summer drawdown is under way and the lake will drop 50 to 60 vertical feet until October when the refill begins. Agua Fria River inflow averages only 3,000 acre feet annually and has no major impact on the lake level. 13 percent full, 120 feet below capacity. Alamo is another impoundment that has featured excellent fishing since the big runoff of 2005. However, the lake is located in a drainage with no snow melt, relying on individual storms for water. Brian Tracy, the chief of reservoir regulation for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, says the lake could drop another 7 feet if downstream water commitments are at their maximum and inflows are minimal. Mark Knapp of Arizona State Parks Department at Alamo, says the boat ramps should be in use for another year under the scenario laid out by Tracy. 24 percent full, 63 feet below capacity. As usual, the level of this Gila River impoundment, located on the San Carlos Apache Indian Reservation east of Globe, is expected to drop dramatically this summer. The lake is currently enjoying some increased water storage from last summer when the watershed received some hefty rainfall. Doug Mason, general manager of the San Carlos Irrigation and Drainage District, would not guess as to how far the drawdown will go this summer, as water is delivered to downstream farmers. "It just depends on what the summer holds (rainfall)," he said. What do you think?

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/273823	Gifted students tackle tough problems More E. Valley Local Coverage Gifted students tackle tough problems May. 10, 2007 05:22 PM Jacobson Elementary fifth-grader Rushi Shah and his classmates had to explore a novel concept: thinking like a teacher. "We're creating a Web site and coming up with ideas for teachers. There are 163,567 ELL (English language learners) in Arizona and they have to take tests after one year, so that's not a lot of time," said the 11-year-old, who is a member of Chandler Unified's gifted program, called Chandler's Academically Talented Students, or CATS. The district's 1,400 CATS students took a new direction this school year with a teaching method designed to foster critical thinking and independent learning. Called problem-based learning, the method involves students teaching themselves through discussing and researching current issues, such as how to teach those who must learn English in one year to take state competency tests. The results of many of these CATS projects will be showcased Saturday with a community fair at Basha High School. Problem-based learning is a break with the traditional teacher-oriented approach to teaching, but advocates say it equips these talented students with the lifelong learning tools they need to flourish. "I just say, 'Go do it,' " said Jacobson CATS teacher Diane Russhon. "These kids are so inquisitive and they love a challenge." In groups of six to nine, Russhon's 27 students spent about 30 minutes every day for the past four months discussing and researching possible solutions to social problems, including the war in Iraq, holes in the ozone layer and dwindling forests. Those students had a direct effect by persuading administrators to increase recycling at the school's cafeteria. And then there's what students call the Language Masters. "I was surprised there were so many Vietnamese (students)," said Jimmy Xu, 11, adding the top three foreign languages spoken in Arizona homes include Spanish, Navajo and Vietnamese. Diane Hale, the district's CATS director, said educators received training in the innovative teaching method. "It's really exciting, this is why we decided to make it visible (with the student exhibition)," she said. Russhon said she balances between challenging her precocious fifth-graders but not frustrating them. "This approach gives them more space to discover things for themselves," she said. Of course, students have been delving into real-world problems before this year, especially those involved in science fairs. In April, Bogle Junior High CATS students dominated at the annual Avnet Science and Technology Fair, where their innovative science projects won more than any other school. Science teacher Mina Sangani said she spends a lot of time discussing with the students what problems to explore, throwing out the obvious: What type of liquid do plants like best or what color will absorb the most heat? "When they finally hit a real-world problem, they are so excited and eager to find a solution," she said. Daniel Lie, 11, of the Language Masters group works on building a website to help English Language Learners in his gifted fifth grade class. MORE ON THIS TOPIC Chandler Unified gifted students share their real-world projects with the community during a community fair. In addition, there will be interactive events, such as mock crimes and bridge building competitions. 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Saturday. Basha High School gym, 5990 S. Val Vista Road.

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/273787	State needs to develop, sell plan for sustainability More E. Valley Local Coverage State needs to develop, sell plan for sustainability May. 10, 2007 03:46 PM It's time for the Valley to consider a massive and regional planning effort to ensure water supplies, reduce traffic congestion and just make it a better place to live in the future, a Utah attorney advised Southeast Valley business and government leaders Wednesday. Utah launched such a project, called Envision Utah, in 1997 after realizing its rapid growth was going to leave it short of water, full of dirty air and with intolerable traffic congestion, said Robert Grow, an attorney who helped lead the award-winning, decade-long project. "You can either accommodate (the growth) and keep this as a great place to live or you can stop the growth. To stop the growth, you got to make it an undesirable place for everyone," Grow said at an East Valley Partnership forum on creating competitive and sustainable communities. The Utah project was guided by a diverse committee of about 150 people, and an annual budget of more than $1million. After a long process that included surveys, 42 specific strategies were developed. Envision Utah has won top awards from the Urban Land Institute, Alliance for Regional Stewardship, American Planning Association and American Public Transportation Association. It also inspired similar plans in southern California, southern Louisiana, Dallas, Chicago and other areas. Grow said he believes it made residents more aware of transit systems as a way to curb traffic congestion and air pollution. Last fall, residents in Utah approved speeding up construction of their transit programs by 15 years, he said. Grow said Arizona has a good opportunity to plan cities that are self-sustaining, such as the 1,010-acre Superstition Vista site in Pinal County that could bring in a million residents and double the size of the Southeast Valley over the next decades. Roc Arnett, president and CEO of the East Valley Partnership, said he invited Grow to speak to get Southeast Valley leaders thinking regionally and because Grow "is one of the few people in the country that has got this notion of planning big and bringing the whole community together." Some regional studies are already under way, Arnett said. The Maricopa Association of Governments and the Transportation & Infrastructure Moving AZ's Economy Coalition, (TIME Coalition) are involved in transportation studies. And the Urban Land Institute is taking an "urban reality check" and looking at growth in Pinal and Maricopa counties and part of Yavapai County.

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/273639	Study: Young girls more likely to be fat More E. Valley Local Coverage Study: Young girls more likely to be fat May. 10, 2007 10:57 AM As every Western nation struggles with child obesity, the Swedes are puzzled by an unusual blip in the data: Why are little girls more likely to be fat than little boys? A recent study by researchers at Sweden's Uppsala University showed that today's 4-year-old girls were six times as likely to be obese compared to 20 years ago - a bigger jump than among boys. "This indicates that there is a relatively recent change in our lifestyles that is behind this," said Ulf Holmback, the lead researcher for the study published in the April issue of Acta Paediatrica. "But it's difficult to say what that is." The weight increase itself was expected - Swedes, along with most other Europeans, have been getting heavier. But obesity experts are scratching their heads over the gender difference that emerges in obesity rates. In 1982, just 1 percent of all 4-year-olds were deemed obese. By 2002, 2 percent of the boys that age were obese, but 6 percent of the girls were. The discrepancy was similar for 10-year-olds. An analysis of children who are overweight - not obese - the percentage of overweight 4-year-olds has roughly doubled to 20 percent for girls and 18 percent for boys during the same 20-year period. (Generally, a child 42 inches tall weighing 50 pounds would be considered obese; the same child weighing 45 pounds would be considered overweight.) "It's hard to come up with a smart explanation for this," said Carl-Erik Flodmark, head of the child obesity center at Malmo University Hospital. "One biological explanation could be that boys are more active, and when the calorie load increases, maybe girls are more affected." Flodmark, considered one of Europe's experts on childhood obesity, said the research could be skewed because it studied children from just one part of Sweden. But, he said, other studies also reveal the gender difference in obesity rates for that age group. According to data compiled by the International Association for the Study of Obesity, IASO, the situation seems unique to Sweden. The IASO has compiled surveys from all European Union countries, and typically the differences in the obesity rates for boys and girls are very small. In countries that have large gender discrepancies among children - such as Greece and Estonia - it is the boys who have higher rates of being overweight. And among adults across Europe, women generally are fitter than men. Since 1980, when Swedes were among of the slimmest of Western nationalities, obesity among adults has doubled from 5 percent to 10 percent by 2005 in both sexes, according to Sweden's national statistics agency. However, roughly half the men are overweight compared to 36 percent of the women. That is still far lower than the United States, where recent government figures show 71 percent of men are overweight, and two-thirds of women are. About one-third of the U.S. adult population is obese. Among EU nations, Sweden is in the middle, with Germany, Greece and the Czech Republic the most overweight, according to the IASO. The IASO's Neville Rigby said Sweden is hardly alone in having heavier children. "Worldwide, in every country, we're beginning to see changes taking place, sometimes quite rapidly," Rigby said. Holmback and other researchers hope to eventually sort out why Swedish girls are getting heavier than boys. Both he and Flodmark said it is crucial to help girls who are obese because they suffer more under the pressure of modern beauty ideals. "It doesn't matter as much for boys if they are obese," Flodmark said.

Summer arrives today, bringing the unmistakable weight of our annual four-month heat wave. Today's high is forecast to hit 103. It will be 104 on Saturday. Mother's Day should come in at about 102. Those will be this year's highest temperatures yet and a clear indication that it is time for our annual change. We will cross the street to walk in the shade and wait minutes for a parking spot out of the sun. Meals will move back indoors, and parents will begin their desperate search for things to do with the kids that don't include heat exhaustion. "Our spring has been phenomenal," said Tony Haffer of the National Weather Service. "But this is probably the start of our true hot season." And how long will it last?

Valley Local Coverage Tempe Union names new superintendent Special for The Republic May. 11, 2007 05:34 PM The Tempe Union High School District Governing Board selected a longtime district administrator as its new superintendent Friday. Associate superintendent Steve Adolph will take the helm after 25 years in Tempe. Board member Don Keuth said Adolph's extensive knowledge of the district was a key factor in the decision. "He rose to the top," Keuth said minutes after the choice was announced. Litchfield Park educational consultant Doug Wilson was the other finalist. Adolph starts July 1. Details of his contract, including salary and benefits, have yet to be determined. The salary range is $125,000 to $160,000. He replaces Superintendent Shirley Miles, who is leaving after her third year with Tempe Union. A graduate of Marcos de Niza High School, Adolph was a teacher, principal and athletic coach before becoming associate superintendent in 2001. "I am excited. We are poised to really go places," he said. "I am confident with the team we have here, the sky's the limit for Tempe Union."

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/273822	Possible $7 million cut worries tech schools More E. Valley Local Coverage Possible $7 million cut worries tech schools May. 10, 2007 06:13 PM The superintendent of the East Valley Institute of Technology, the largest technical high school in Arizona, is troubled by pending legislation that would cut funding of the state's technical schools by $7 million. If two bills introduced in the Legislature are passed, EVIT could lose up to $2.5 million next year, according to school officials, and it would not be able to afford the likes of new software for computer-programming students and up-to-date tools for those studying auto mechanics. "We just wouldn't be able to buy equipment to train kids," said Sally Downey, EVIT's chief administrator. "The whole idea of EVIT was to have this beautiful campus with the latest equipment to train kids for jobs." The school, founded in 1992, has an enrollment of about 5,000 students. About 3,000 of those attend its west Mesa campus, where they spend half the day at their home high school and the remainder at EVIT. Almost three dozen occupational programs are taught at the school, which is the only state-funded technical school with its own campus. Culinary-arts student Julie Fiedler, a Higley High and EVIT senior, recently won a $70,000 scholarship to the Art Institute of Phoenix. Her goal is to become a gourmet chef. "We have instructors who are chefs, who have worked in the industry and know how it is," Fiedler said of EVIT. "For most of the kids (in culinary arts) there, this is what they want to do. It's a preparatory program that gives you the foundation." Dave Lane, an auto mechanic by trade and a member of the governing board for Mesa Public Schools, said he does not know the reasoning behind the proposed cuts - but does know the value of EVIT to the workplace. "It's something we've got to look at real closely, because that kind of education is just vital for our economy," Lane said. Workers with technical skills are in high demand, he said, and "we can't get by without them." He said he would like to know if there is an alternative source of funds if the Legislature goes through with the cuts. The state's other technical schools are situated on high school campuses and have grown in popularity to the point that state aid was capped in 2004 by lawmakers, who were concerned about adequate financial oversight. That limit has been removed, freeing up $34 million (toward a total of $100 million) to go to the schools. However, the schools are concerned that funding has not kept up with growth. Since 2004, new technical schools have opened in Pima County and Paradise Valley. Norm Colbert, the president of EVIT's governing board, said he was surprised when a fellow board member called Thursday to tell him about the proposed cuts. "I'm kind of in the dark on this," Colbert said. "I have no background as to what's going on. But obviously any monetary loss hurts." He said EVIT is in the process of erecting a medical building. "We did that out of funds we possessed instead of going after bonds or tax money," he said. "You can be pennywise and sometimes be punished for it. When we're producing the product and placing it in jobs and getting national recognition, this is kind of depressing. "I have no clue as to what (the Legislature's) basis is (for the cuts)."

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/273784	Tempe mom thrilled to add two more to her brood More E. Valley Local Coverage Tempe mom thrilled to add two more to her brood May. 10, 2007 03:46 PM The first four of Leslyn Wiese's children came the traditional way: as tiny, wrinkled babies. The newest members arrived via airplane. The difference was big, but in the three months since the two Indian adoptees arrived, they have quickly blended into the Tempe family. Wiese and her husband, Mike, made the 36-hour Air India journey to Mumbai in February. They boarded the plane armed with some children's clothing, a digital camera and travel books on site-seeing and etiquette. Wiese had to guesstimate at clothes sizes. Most of what she knew about her new children was through written profiles of Prakash, 6, and Laxmi, 7, provided by the adoption agency. When they de-planed in Mumbai, "there was half of humanity looking at us," said Mike Wiese, with wonder even though months have passed. Right away they noticed cultural differences, big and small. The roads and buildings were intensely crowded. The food was rich and spicy, even for breakfast. People stared at the couple's pale skin, Leslyn's dreadlocked hair and Mike's small hoop earrings. "It was a bit unnerving," Leslyn said. But even thousands of miles away, the Wieses couldn't completely leave the United States behind - Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie had been there only months before, filming a movie. The Hollywood stars had even spent time in the Pune orphanage where Laxmi and Prakash had been living. When the new family met, the children were just as excited as the parents were, calling both Mike and Leslyn "mommy-daddy" and running around snapping pictures of their friends and caretakers with disposable cameras the Wieses brought for them. The adoption came at a critical time. The orphanage was licensed to care for children up to six years old. Laxmi was already above that limit, but got to stay so she could be with her younger brother. The Wieses were matched with the children in April. Prakash turned six four months later. That birthday would have required the siblings be shifted to an orphanage where adoption isn't an option. When the Wieses returned to Arizona there was more family to meet. The couple already had four teenage and adult biological children and a newborn granddaughter. Laxmi and Prakash spoke only the most remedial English when they arrived: colors, numbers and other basics. Much has changed since then. On a recent weekday, they played games on the Internet and chattered about pictures they brought with them from India. "It has changed our home for sure, to have little kids in the house," Leslyn said. "People are sticking stickers on the wall and writing their names on doors again. There are Barbies everywhere and toys in the bathtub. I haven't seen the news since we got them because if the TV is on we're watching PBS Kids." Even so, reverting to mothering youngsters is a decision Wiese is happy about. "I still had some parenting in me," she said, smiling. "I wasn't done being a mom yet."

Valley Local Coverage Fashion Center won't get parking garage May. 10, 2007 03:46 PM Shoppers wanting relief from the parking crunch at Chandler Fashion Center may have to wait a while longer. The mall's owner, Westcor, has tabled the idea of building a garage there. "We were looking at the possibility of developing residences as part of (the garage,) and the townhome and condo residential market has certainly slowed down in the past several months," Westcor executive Garrett Newland said. A bright spot, however, is that two new movie theater complexes in the far Southeast Valley may siphon some of those residents, making it less congested at the Chandler mall for the remaining south Tempe and west Chandler residents. The opening of the new Harkins multiplex at Tempe Marketplace near Loops 101 and 202 interchange, will give Tempe residents another option. It will include a giant-screen theater modeled after the old Cine Capri on Camelback Road, and may open in July. Although Westcor has no immediate plans to move forward with a parking garage, the company will continue to consider it, Newland said. "Parking is obviously very important, and we'll continue to evaluate the issue and try to find ways to make it a little bit better," he said.

Valley Local Coverage Becoming a mom isn't easy for everyone May. 11, 2007 01:41 PM Lisa Greenacre, a nurse practitioner and a mom, knows first hand how poignant Mother's Day can be for women who are infertile. She works at the Fertility Treatment Center in south Tempe, where some women still can't get pregnant despite the latest scientific developments. "We just assume that our right to be a parent is just kind of a God-given right and when it doesn't work out that way it is really difficult for people," Greenacre said. "I always feel bad on Mother's Day because I think our patients feel particularly left out on that day. Sometimes relatives will ask them, 'When are you going to have children?' or 'How come you haven't had children yet?' They may be trying or have been trying for some time and may not be comfortable sharing that with other people." The treatment center offers in-vitro fertilization, embryo transfers, artificial insemination, embryonic storage, prescreening of embryos for genetic disorders and other services. Greenacre helps with the procedures and also teaches classes for couples considering in-vitro fertilization. More women are waiting these days until they are in their 40s to get pregnant. But the older a woman is, the less likely she will get pregnant even with the larger variety of options today, Greenacre said. Greenacre, 46, has a son, 18, and daughter, 14. She has also seen successes, including parents who are getting fertility treatments for their second and third children. Excited parents send photos or bring their children by. The center has several albums full of success story photos. "Invariably they say, 'This is our dream come true.' That is the wonderful part of the job. It's much better than the downside," Greenacre said. As for the downside, she advises women who can't get pregnant to look for other mothering outlets. "There are lots of ways people handle that desire to be a mother. Maybe they can adopt or foster parent. Or they can channel that mothering energy into something else, volunteer work or their careers," she said.

Valley Local Coverage Tempe firefighter honored to create Gilbert memorial May. 11, 2007 01:43 PM From the firefighter's oxygen air pack to the police officer's Glock handgun, the details of the Gilbert Public Safety Memorial are hard to miss. Artist Steve Schneider said he wanted to ensure that the depiction of the memorial was real, and to do that he wanted everything right down to the equipment to be correct. To accomplish that goal, all he had to was to fall back on his other job. "I have the benefit of being on the job," the Tempe firefighter said. "So I know the equipment that we carry." Schneider was tasked with designing and sculpting the memorial last July, and despite the narrow timeline, he didn't want to sacrifice details at the expense of realism. "I didn't want people to look at it and point out things that are wrong," Schneider said. Not only were there details in both public safety officers' equipment, but also in the action depicted. "I try to portray movement," said the self-professed sculpting "novice." "A possible scenario is that this takes place at a house fire and a firefighter hands over the care of the girl to the police officer. . . . (Fire and police) work more closely than people expect," Schneider said. The sculpture is the culmination of months of planning and work that Schneider said he couldn't have completed without his wife, Donna. "Every day I wasn't on the job, I was in my garage working on (the sculpture). I was so happy when I sent it on to the foundry," Schneider said. "I just did (the sculpture) on top, everything else below that my wife took care of." That includes the etched granite pedestal and tiles around the base. Schneider said it's the best sculpture he has done. "I'm extremely pleased with it," he said. Steve Schneider says the Gilbert Public Safety Memorial is the best sculpture he has done.

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/274201	Tempe gallery to show young artists' watercolors More E. Valley Local Coverage Tempe gallery to show young artists' watercolors May. 11, 2007 01:42 PM Some of the best watercolor work from young artists around the nation will exhibit at Tempe City Hall Gallery starting Monday. The National Society of Arts and Letters (NSAL) organizes a competition for ages 18-29 in a different discipline each year, including dance, drama, literature, music, musical theater and visual arts. Each of the chapters then asks for submissions and chooses one. The NSAL will award the national winner a $10,000 prize at a banquet at Tempe Mission Palms on May 19. This year, 19 of the 23 chapters entered works. Tawni Shuler, 25, of Tempe, is the finalist for the Greater Arizona chapter of the NSAL and is excited she's in the running even if she doesn't nab the purse. "It's a great opportunity to meet people that are active in the arts in the Phoenix area," she said, "and, artists are coming in from all over and I get to meet them and work with them." "Our goal is to help these young people reach their potential," said Ruth Albright, president of the NSAL. "They really can go on to have very, very worthwhile careers." In 2004, she said, the NSAL competition was in musical theater, and "so many of those young people are now participating in Broadway shows." Chapters also keep in touch with winners and encourage them. Shuler, a student in the master of fine arts program at Arizona State University, already won $3,000 for taking first place in the Greater Arizona chapter. "I'm putting together my thesis show in February of '08," she said, "so the money will be put to use." Judging the contest are: Robert T. McCall of Paradise Valley, a renowned local artist who has documented the space program and has works at the Challenger Space Center in Peoria; New York artist and author M. Stephen Doherty, who has served as editor-in-chief of magazines; still-life painter Harriet Shorr from New York City; and Mel Yoakum, curator of the Francoise Gilot Archive in California.

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/274123	Being a mom provides experience for paid work More E. Valley Local Coverage Being a mom provides experience for paid work May. 11, 2007 10:34 AM No CEO or high-ranking manager's career skills can compare to Dawn Nowakoski's. She's a pro at being patient with her subordinates, solving problems and perfecting time management. After nearly two decades honing her skills at home with her children, Nowakoski has entered the work force and says nothing could have prepared her better than motherhood. "My children had been training me," says the Indianapolis mother of eight. Conventional workplace thinking says combining a career and motherhood means somehow being out of whack. But could it be that being a mom gives women an advantage in the workplace? "We can make the most of it by knowing ourselves and the strengths we have gained through motherhood," says Kelly Watson, president of Career Partners, which works with executives who want to succeed at work and family. Take a look at five strengths moms develop at home and can put to good use in the workplace. Resolving any questions or matter involving doubt, uncertainty or difficulty. - Mom: School-aged children give moms the best training for this. They bring all sorts of questions and issues home from school. - Career: You use this every day, whether it's dealing with a gossipy co-worker or getting into the details of a company report. "Let's face it. In a home with eight children, there's rarely a day that goes by that doesn't include a problem of some sort," says Nowakoski, who works for Indianapolis Public Schools. "I've had to learn how to solve those problems - or at least guide my children in solving them." Dealing or bargaining with others. - Mom: Toddlers are the best teachers. Just think about encouraging them to drink milk instead of soda. - Career: Raises from the boss, sales to clients. As a mother, you negotiate every day. You become an artist at hearing the opponent's side and then working to make him or her happy while still getting what you want. "Nothing prepares you for a big negotiation like negotiating with a toddler," says Liz Chandler, of Fishers, Ind. "I know that if I can get my 2-year-old to agree to what I need to do, chances are that I can get what I need from my suppliers, too." Enduring annoyance, misfortune and pain without complaint, loss of temper or anger. - Mom: Babies are great teachers of patience. After all, they can't tell you what they want, and without patience, frustration ensues. It takes time and commitment to make them happy. - Career: Think about the boss you just can't seem to persuade to see your side. Or, as a leader, dealing with the needs and wants of a whole team. Along with patience comes compassion. "Babies force a certain sensitivity to their needs," says Watson - which can translate to others' needs in the workplace. Making the best and most efficient use of time. - Mom: Middle school and high school children force this upon moms. With all the activities during and after school and on the weekends, moms are forced to maneuver schedules, plus squeeze in cooking dinner, helping with homework, doing laundry and more. After giving birth to a first child, 51 percent of women return to work within four months, according to the U.S. Census. That's a lot of women who know time management. - Career: You have deadlines, e-mails to respond to, phone calls to return, meetings and business luncheons to attend. Belief in oneself, one's abilities, correctness or likelihood of success. - Mom: If you can pull off raising a child, enough said.

http://www.azcentral.com/rsslinks/274122	Speed signs will warn of red-light cameras ahead More E. Valley Local Coverage Speed signs will warn of red-light cameras ahead May. 11, 2007 11:46 AM Electronic speed signs will soon be flashing at several Chandler intersections, marking the first time a Valley city combines speed warnings with photo traffic enforcement. On Thursday the City Council unanimously approved spending $295,587 on 64 speed reader boards, which will be permanently mounted on poles approaching key intersections. The devices flash passing vehicles' speeds, and city officials say they hope to slow drivers before they enter the intersection - and before intersection cameras capture them speeding or running a red light. Sixteen of the intersections will be equipped with speed reader boards in four directions; 12 of those will also be equipped with photo speed and red light cameras. Transportation Engineer Mike Mah said the boards, about the size of speed limit signs, will be installed in the next two to three weeks. Installation of photo radar equipment is expected to be complete at most intersections by mid-July,he said. Ten of those intersections are considered Chandler's most dangerous based on number of reported accidents. No other Valley cities combine the two technologies, Mah said. Money for the speed readers, which were proposed by Councilman Jeff Weninger, will come from traffic fines. The council voted in March to expand its photo enforcement program from 8 to 12 intersections and add speed cameras, exposing drivers to two citations if they speed through a red light. Scottsdale-based Redflex Traffic Systems runs the cameras and gets $19 for each activation. Money from the fines, which average $200, goes to the city. "The ultimate goal is to get people not to speed or run red lights," Weninger said. "If we fine people for doing that, the money should go back into reducing speed and accidents." Reports released by police earlier this year show the number of accidents has gone down 5 to 10 percent and injury accidents decreased 22 to 42 percent two years after red-light cameras were installed at the current eight locations. A pilot speed enforcement program last year reduced the number of speeders and accidents at two intersections even though violators received only warnings. What do you think?

http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/10/14/little-asia-israel/	Little Asia - Israel | fiLi&#8217;s world Study Chinese Podcasts List East Asian and OB Studies 2006-7 Saturday, October 14th, 2006...11:54 am Little Asia - Israel It has become a reality - Israel has its own Little Asia in the heart of Tel-Aviv. Up till a few years ago, Israel only had a few Asian immigrants that Israel embraced when they escaped from horrors in their own country , but in the past few years, ever since Israel has significantly decreased Palestinians coming in due to security considerations, Asians have been allowed to come and work in Israel, forming a completely new society within. Seems like Israeli fascination with Asians is contagious as one of my friends - Yael Elad - has started a new project in photography - Asian foreign workers in Israel. Every Friday and Saturday the Asian foreign workers get together in a Tel-Aviv neighborhood to hang out and do some shopping. Here is a bit from the visit : If it wasn&#8217;t for the occasional Hebrew, there was no way of telling this is really in TelAviv and not in China or Manila. I&#8217;ve seen crowds of Philippians in Jerusalem&#8217;s downtown and the occasional Chinese pals walking the streets after a hard day&#8217;s work, but this is something else. My friend writes : "I just came back and I still can&#8217;t grasp all that I&#8217;ve seen. The dynamics overwhelms all senses. At some point I stopped taking photos and just watched the foreign crowd with fascination. It seems surreal that this is in Israel". Asians are becoming a part of Israeli reality and I honestly think that Israel isn&#8217;t prepared. Hearing a few lectures about the current conditions of Asian foreign workers in Israel, and having small chitchats with the ones willing to talk to me, I am naturally concerned. I think I would want to head over there as well and talk to them, help them feel more at home here - if that&#8217;s even possible. I can&#8217;t explain why, I feel like I owe it to them and myself.

As the new semester at the is starting on the 25th, I&#8217;ve browsed through the selection of courses available for this semester to pick some what might be interesting for me to attend. I&#8217;m currently registered as a "special student" preparing for a PhD, allowing me to take a mixture of courses that I&#8217;m interested in. Reading through the course list, here&#8217;s what I think sounds really interesting: North and south Korea : Political system, society and economy. Society in Japan, China, Korea, Taiwan & Singapore (the only course in the university that I know of with any direct reference to Taiwan & Singapore). America&#8217;s response to China during the 20th century. Popular culture and media & social changes in China (a course given in English). Since taking all of those is almost a full-time student, and my time does have its limitations, I&#8217;ll probably go and check them out during the beginning of the semester.

But there's a very tight social control, so if you're misbehaving you'll be reported pretty soon. indeed, lots of things are "hidden" from the tourists, unfortunately. I recommend watching a couple BBC documentaries to get a feel of how dramatic it is really. I was also told that the subway was so deep to be used as a nuclear shelter as well in case of a capitalist attack. Local TV only shows a few channels filled with propaganda. Of course, most people don't even have a TV there. The party members however, enjoy full satellite service, with about 100 channels, from CNN to south korean entertainment channels. I visited pyongyang right after 9/11 and it was pretty "interesting" to hear the peoples' opinion..

If a formal article in an Israeli newspaper about doing business in China advises that you should give gifts on a personal basis and should not take "no" for an answer, what does that mean? It just so happens that that annual report for the year 2006. The Asian rankings are as follows (from best to worst) : Cluster 1 - Japan (out of 11 countries in cluster) Cluster 2 - Singapore (out of 6) Cluster 3 - Hong-Kong, South Korea, Malaysia (& Israel - out of 8 ) Cluster 4 - Taiwan, China, India (out of 5) A short Asian related comment from the report : In contrast, Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan performed substantially worse in the BPI 2006 than in the CPI 2005. This can lead one to conclude that companies from these countries are more likely to bribe when they operate overseas than would be accepted back home. This apparent tendency for companies to let standards slip when working in countries with less stringent regulations than their home countries is alarming, and underlines the need for governments to take responsibility for the way their companies do business abroad as well as at home. The question posed in this research was : &lsquo;In your experience, to what extent do firms from the countries you have selected make undocumented extra payments or bribes?&#39; For both Taiwan, China and Israel this report is quite relevant to recent happenings as leaders of these countries are faced with criticism regarding possible bribery related scandals. President Chen is in trouble because of various affairs, like the Sogo story with his wife. China has recently done the unimaginable with due to a pension scandal .

At the inaugural ceremony of Louis Frieberg Center for Asian Studies at the Hebrew University, Prof. Kenneth Lieberthal from the University of Michigan gave a keynote lecture on China&#8217;s economic growth and its future challenges, namely " The Fundamental Forces and Challenges Shaping China&#8217;s Future Lieberthal noted that although China has maintained a unprecedented GDP growth in recent years, it faces both internal and external challenges in the course of a sustainable development, including resource shortage, pollution, problematic social ethics and so on. Following his lecture, the audience raised a broad range of questions over issues concerning China. [&#8230;] Yeah, I was there. Before I comment on the lecture, allow me a few background observations : For the first time I know the Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese officials in Israel were invited to the same event. On the first row, in the far right there were the Taiwanese officials. If you look closely, you might notice the big gap of empty chairs in the middle, as in the far left were the Chinese officials. I couldn&#8217;t make out the Korean and Japanese ambassadors, although I&#8217;ve met them before. None of the 3 speakers from the Hebrew University managed to address the Taiwanese official directly. One referred to the Taiwanese ambassador as head of the "Taipei economic office in Tel Aviv", another welcomed the Japanese, Chinese, Korean and other delegates", and the last ignored Taiwan altogether. I&#8217;m still not sure how "face" works, but I think a lot of face was lost that evening. The lecture was very well put. I can&#8217;t say that the Prof. said anything that was new to me, but seeing it all together did bring new insights. True, the Chinese stats are overwhelming no matter how you look at them. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anyone who can really grasp what&#8217;s happening in China, but the presentation does manage to put some order in this whole thing. I believe the key message the Prof. was trying to show to the audience wasn&#8217;t just about China being fine-tuned for success but rather about the unbelievable challenges that China is facing. Although the Prof. was very polite and served a balanced presentation, I&#8217;ll just convey the main idea - scenarios look bad. Very bad. Here&#8217;s why (with some of my thoughts): The environmental catastrophes are overwhelming. The water problem, as an example, is unsolvable. Domestic social pressure that will be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to control. Some of the issues are : Minorities pressure and growing nationalism. An aging rural population. Lack of social ethics system. Law and banking systems are still being defined. The US-China relations will not sustain China&#8217;s growth. US has been losing dominance for years now, and has so far done a lousy job of adjusting to a world with a growing China. This already affects regional and international events (Taiwan, N. Korea, Africa). The world has never seen anything like China before, which makes it hard to imagine a way out of all the issues raised. Audience attempt to compare this China growth to the Japanese during the 70-80s has been rejected, rightfully, by the Prof. on problems like globalization differences. Suggestions that I&#8217;ve heard from friends and colleagues after the lecture comparing what&#8217;s happening in China to what they remember from the martial law in Korea and Taiwan are even more problematic. Thinking of China as a a bigger scale of the Singapore model just doesn&#8217;t work. These are obviously not domestic Chinese issues, these are global concerns. In a way, it&#8217;s clear to me that "the fundamental forces and challenges shaping China&#8217;s future" is actually "the fundamental forces and challenges in China shaping the world&#8217;s future". With the way China&#8217;s growing now, there is no middle road - China might either become the world&#8217;s biggest success story or it might become the world&#8217;s greatest tragedy.

http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/07/19/religion-the-israel-asia-connection/	Religion : The Israel-Asia connection | fiLi&#8217;s world War : Israeli confusion The Israeli web on Asia Wednesday, July 19th, 2006...6:16 am Religion : The Israel-Asia connection It&#8217;s a Friday noon and I&#8217;m walking in Jerusalem&#8217;s downtown area. There&#8217;s good weather and it&#8217;s relatively quiet. Some people are doing their shopping, others sitting down at coffee places sipping coffee. I walk down the street slowly, dodging a few ultra-orthodox Jews who try and convince me to take part in for a quick prayer only to face a strange looking person, white beard in sack clothing shouting out loud - "Behold, the Children of Israel, for it is I - God - who calls upon you on this day&#8230; God of Abraham, Isaac and Jaacob&#8230; Jesus&#8230; Salvation&#8230; Repent&#8230; We are one". That day I was bored as hell. Sure, I had plenty of things to do - some work I needed to finish, some papers I needed to make progress on, but doing all that at home was boring and I got tired very quickly. The usual cure in cases like that is to combine all those activities with my number one hobby - perfected in my Asia tour - "people watching". I put the laptop in my bag, get my self a bottle of ice-water and head out to town. For me - there&#8217;s always something interesting happening there, even if there&#8217;s nothing happening there at all. I stop and stare at this guy, who - with all the Jewish and Muslim crowd going about - could be getting him self into a whole lot of trouble. Jerusalem is very religion sensitive and what ever it is you do - you should watch out for anybody who might be offended by what you&#8217;re saying. He was going on and on, preaching the world of God to God&#8217;s chosen people, namely Jewish people, to come back and embrace Jesus. He was on a roll, and was a bit hard to follow, especially when the by-standers started making fun of him. I must admit I was enjoying the show and that I was very curious to hear what the guy has to say and how this whole situation would turn out. After about 2 minutes of staring at him, a Korean girl came up to me and quietly asked me about my thoughts. Her Hebrew accent was perfect, and when I told her I figured from her accent that she was born here she was kind enough to share her intriguing life story with me about the "Messianic Judaism" religion - Jews who believe in Christ, following both the old and the new testament. She was also curious hearing about my personal journey with religion. We both had a lot of questions so by the time we both got tired the preacher and the whole crowd were long gone. I still have a hard time with western-world religions in places like Asia, embraced by Asians, and I can&#8217;t really say why. The growing power of Christianity that I&#8217;ve seen in Taiwan and have heard about in Korea and China is an issue that has been on my mind for a long while. Whether or not this thing makes sense or not, it is something that&#8217;s happening regardless. In an peculiar way - Christianity and "Messianic Judaism" form the strongest connection that Israel has with Asia and Asians, and the way I see it - that has to be a good thing. Little Asia - Israel The Korean Center in Jerusalem The meaning of being Jewish&#8230; Asians studying Hebrew &raquo; fiLi&#8217;s world [&#8230;] While in Israel I&#39;ve had some interesting encounters with other Asian nationalities who have come to Israel to study more about Judaism. One "Messianic Judaism" Korean girl I met by coincidence in Jerusalem&#39;s downtown was fascinated with the Jewish people and have been staying in Israel for ages, speaking Israeli level Hebrew with no accent. There were also reports on a growing Christian Korean community in Jerusalem. [&#8230;] Reply to this comment The Korean Center in Jerusalem &raquo; fiLi&#8217;s world [&#8230;] Korea is still a big mystery to me. I don&#8217;t really know much about Korea, but I came across Korean influences in almost all the Asian countries that I&#8217;ve been to, and they were always in a positive context. Korean culture - Korean movies, Korean fashion and Korean food are regarded of very high quality and of good style in both Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore. The only Korean influences I&#8217;ve noticed in Israel so far were the growing Korean community at the Hebrew University, a Korean restaurant in Jerusalem and a Korean girl that I met downtown. It weird that almost nobody in the East Asian Department takes the Korean courses and Korea wasn&#8217;t represented in the East-Asia day we had last year. I guess China and Japan are more trendy.

http://www.filination.com/blog/2007/05/09/tourism-promotion-china-taiwan-korea-and-israel/	Tourism promotion : China, Taiwan, Korea and Israel | fiLi&#8217;s world A spoiled westerner in China as a Chinese barber-shop trainee China&#8217;s Top 5 Most Beautiful Girls Wednesday, May 9th, 2007...8:48 am Tourism promotion : China, Taiwan, Korea and Israel Suppose you&#8217;re heading the tourism promotion team for your country, say China, Taiwan, Korea or Israel, and you have total control and no money constraints, what would you focus on? Last week, I talked with two Chinese who visited Israel and were extremely surprised with what they saw here. Putting it nicely, they were expecting a desert wasteland with religious people riding camels and shooting each other. We got into a discussion of how Israel is promoted in China and how China is promoted world wide, and it was interesting to see what each of us wanted to focus on. When I asked them to guess what the Israeli tourism bureau chose to promote Israel with, the Chinese suggested that Israel should focus about the history and culture. They claimed Chinese and the world would be attracted to the fact that Israel is one of the few places with a history as long as China&#8217;s with a unique combination of religion and races. They were quite shocked when I told them what the theme for 2007 was : Yep, beach culture and Israeli girls. There&#8217;s a long debate within those who care about this subject in Israel , but what was interesting is that the Chinese rightfully responded with - "but why look for that in Israel when we can go have that in Thailand?". And so, I tried to remember all the promotional videos I saw of countries I follow closely in East Asia. Consider, for example, China - Israel&#8217;s 2nd most popular tourist destination for the year 2006, with the emphasis on Chinese scenery and culture: Or maybe Taiwan&#8217;s "Touch your heart" campaign: But the best promotion video I saw lately was at the opening of the Korean movie festival in Jerusalem, with Korea&#8217;s new "Dynamic Korea": Which one do you like? how would you promote those countries? Are Chinese restaurants in Israel any good? Hopes and fears : the missile era &#8220;Magical Taiwan&#8221; Exhibition in Jerusalem Bribe Payers Index 2006 : Asia Freedom 2006: Taiwan first and North Korea last in Asian ranking I&#8217;ve also shocked by the theme of Israel.. oh my. lol It&#8217;s like a commercial for women&#8217;s shaver or something (no offense Israel!) Interesting, my assumption was that Israel would probably promote some archival sites or something historical/mystical or&#8230; something that could totally contradict with media coverage on conflicts. Hmm&#8230; beach and girls eh? Also surprised by the wonderful job of Korea. Can&#8217;t think of any to add to that. Smart move that it didn&#8217;t film the rush hour in Seoul - which is, according to one foreign journalist, so much scarier than the 38 parallel! Reply to this comment Putting it nicely, they were expecting a desert wasteland with religious people riding camels and shooting each other. I hadn&#8217;t thought of camels, but I have to admit that &#8220;people shooting each other&#8221; was one of the first images that popped to mind. Having never been there, it&#8217;s really hard to understand just how dangerous it is (or isn&#8217;t). I suppose it&#8217;s only the terrible stuff that makes the news&#8230; Reply to this comment Yeah, Israel&#8217;s got the absolute worst PR in the world. Personally, I feel much better about my little sister wondering around Jerusalem in the middle of the night than I do about any other big city around the world. Security is a complicated issue. There are similar terror concerns in southern Thailand, Russia, and from what I hear from my professors - European countries like Spain and several regions in China.

http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/10/15/east-asian-and-ob-studies-2006-7/	East Asian and OB Studies 2006-7 | fiLi&#8217;s world Little Asia - Israel China and Taiwan Forums List Sunday, October 15th, 2006...3:54 am East Asian and OB Studies 2006-7 China related blogs are a necessity to deal with my endless curiosity for the Chinese culture but they&#39;re not enough. I still need the class interaction and dynamics, that which I&#39;ve experienced last year when I joined up the East-Asia department at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem as a listener. As the new academic year 2006-7 at the is starting on the 22 . I&#39;ve browsed through the selection of courses available this year and quickly came to the conclusion that if it was up to me - I would probably want to attend most of them. Since I&#39;m not an officially registered student and my free time does have some limitations, I&#39;ve picked out a few courses and will do my best to attend them, or at least get to know their professors : : I&#39;ve been drilling my Culture-OB mantra into Dr. Sagiv&#39;s since I came back from Asia and was happy to learn that she took up the subject as her next Organizational Behavior class. How does national and organizational culture effect organizations and employees? How does the interaction between different cultures and organizations within those cultures effect each other? , second year - (and Language Lab) : Second year of battling Chinese. I will need to catch up on my writing and Simplified Chinese as I&#39;ve been postponing that for too long. It will do me good to have an organized schedule for my Chinese, as I haven&#39;t been doing very well on that lately. Urban Society in Contemporary China - Changes : The description sounds intriguing - "Changes in urban China, socially and economically&#8230; we&#39;ll discuss the main three events on Beijing 2008, Shanghai Expo 2010 and Asia Games 2010&#8230; we&#39;ll try and see the effect of those upcoming events and their influence on society in the Chinese cities". - Prof. Ishay Yaffe : Everybody I talked to in my Business-Administration department told me "he&#39;s the man" - the number one authority regarding BA and East-Asia. Looking forward to meeting him. (Too bad there&#39;s nothing remotely related to Taiwan) That should ease my curiosity for the time being&#8230; East Asia and Business Studies 2007 The Israeli Louis Frieberg Center for East Asian Studies Fellowship Israeli East-Asia Back-to-school Party fili, you are so interested in asian culture like china, why not work in china? haha. being there is the best way to learn the culture. Reply to this comment Heh&#8230; I&#8217;d love to. Are you or your company looking for someone to join ? I&#8217;m hoping this is temporary while I&#8217;m searching for an academic program and work, Reply to this comment unfortunately, i just startup this company and no much business now. but if you know some israel companies want to enter china market, we can collaborate to help them:) Reply to this comment Heh &#8230; I work for free in exchange for something interesting to do and nice people to talk to. Good luck with the company. Reply to this comment thanks. when my website is ready, i think you have interesting thing to do:) Reply to this comment you probably meant to Ishay Yaffe. he is grate. i took another course of him last year, and that&#8217;s why i register to this course too. it will be grate to study with you again. bummer you are not going to do any assignment. Reply to this comment If the assignment is interesting, I&#8217;ll do it anyway. Do they do those in pairs? See you in school&#8230; Reply to this comment dear fili, can you easily explain to me what OB-culture means? Thank you Reply to this comment Oh, right. I didn&#8217;t even explain what OB is. Well, it stands for Organizational Behavior, a field of somewhat psychological studies about organizations. In OB, culture might refer to the national culture, the organizational culture, or a culture of a sub-group in an organization. Reply to this comment Click here to cancel "reply".

To my surprise, while it is not the best movie, it is definitely one of my favorites of the year and one of my favorite comedies of all time. I hope I get a chance to see it again because apparently there are a lot of little subtle things in it that you don't see the first or maybe even the second time around. I think some people get too caught up in the fact that the movie lacks realism, but I think that's what makes it all the wackier and funnier. I usually have a very low regard for Asian comedies, but this one was certainly worth watching. Absolutely hilarious but maintaining a touching side to it. The characters and situations are so interesting and absorbing that you tend to forget that you are being manipulated by all the sappiness. Was the above comment useful to you?

http://www.filination.com/blog/2007/02/09/the-israeli-louis-frieberg-center-for-east-asian-studies-fellowship/	The Israeli Louis Frieberg Center for East Asian Studies Fellowship | fiLi&#8217;s world The Chinese stereotype for the &#8220;Jewish way&#8221; China-Israel related quick links : Feb 10th Friday, February 9th, 2007...12:30 am The Israeli Louis Frieberg Center for East Asian Studies Fellowship Israel might seem at first as a strange place to consider conducting East Asian research in, but this year a new East-Asian Louis Frieberg Center is being setup at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem-Israel and the new center is offering fellowships. Louis Frieberg Center for East Asian Studies The Center has set to itself the ambitious goal of establishing the Hebrew University as a national and a world-renowned hub of East Asian Studies. The Center, through its activities, will aim to pool together scholars from different departments and faculties within the Hebrew University, from the Israeli scholarly community, and from abroad and will catalyze high level interdisciplinary research, focusing on history of East Asia, its cultures, and its traditional and contemporary societies and political structures. fellowship offered to international scholars The Louis Frieberg Center for East Asian Studies offers post-doctoral fellowships for the year 2007-2008. The post-docs are open to scholars in the humanities and social sciences specializing in East Asia, especially China, Japan and Korea. Fellowships are granted for one year or one term with the possibility of extension for an additional year. The starting date of the visit should not be later than four years after receipt of the Doctoral Degree; the fellow must hold a valid Doctoral Degree no later than April 2007. The fellowship consists of a monthly stipend (tax free) of $1,250 and a housing allowance of $100. Payments are made once in three months in Israeli Shekels and are linked to the &ldquo;representative rate of exchange.&rdquo; Fellows are entitled to one airline ticket (economy class) for a direct flight from their home town to Israel and back. The fellows are expected to teach one or two courses in the Hebrew University (for additional payment, according to the Hebrew University regulations). The ability to teach a course in Hebrew is welcome, but is not a prerequisite for attaining the fellowship. The fellows are also expected to actively participate in the life and activities of the Louis Frieberg Center for East Asian Studies. The fellows will present their research at the department seminar of the East Asian Studies Department, and possibly at other relevant forums. Any work outside the Hebrew University would be allowed only after specific approval by the Frieberg Center. Since I&#8217;m currently looking for interesting PhD oppurtunities in east-Asia, and have a difficult time in finding offered fellowships I thought I might do my share in promoting the ones offered by my university. If you know of any interesting Business-Administration/Cross-Cultural Psychology scholarships offered at east-Asia, especially in China or Taiwan (but also Korea, Japan and Singapore), then I&#8217;m very interested. The fundamental forces and challenges shaping China&#8217;s future : Prof. Kenneth Lieberthal at HUJI East Asian and OB Studies 2006-7 East Asia and Business Studies 2007 Hi. THank you for the info. Could I ask you if the stipend of the fellowship at the Louis Frieberg Center is too small for making a living? I heard that Jerusalem was very expensive. Reply to this comment Oh yeah, if you&#8217;re not used to extremely high-standard, 1250US$ should take of you fine in Jerusalem. Rent in down-town Jerusalem in about 600US$ (for a nice flat on your own), and all other costs are relatively not expensive for western countries. I wrote this next file about a year ago and it might be helpful for you : (I&#8217;m writing this as I&#8217;m staying in London, which I believe is a few times more expensive than Jerusalem) If you have any other questions, let me know - I&#8217;d be happy to help.

Interesting, my assumption was that Israel would probably promote some archival sites or something historical/mystical or&#8230; something that could totally contradict with media coverage on conflicts. Hmm&#8230; beach and girls eh? Also surprised by the wonderful job of Korea. Can&#8217;t think of any to add to that.

I hadn't thought of camels, but I have to admit that "people shooting each other" was one of the first images that popped to mind. Having never been there, it's really hard to understand just how dangerous it is (or isn't). I suppose it's only the terrible stuff that makes the news...

Personally, I feel much better about my little sister wondering around Jerusalem in the middle of the night than I do about any other big city around the world. Security is a complicated issue. There are similar terror concerns in southern Thailand, Russia, and from what I hear from my professors - European countries like Spain and several regions in China.

Aside from what I&#8217;ve already covered, here are some more recent news and events related to Asia-Israel connections : Jung Chang, the famous author of Wild Swans and "Mao - the unknown story", will visit Israel together with her husband - Jon Halliday - to speak at the Tel Aviv University conference about the Mao book. Conference will take place on the 14th of May, starting at 09:30 in Drachlis hall (496). a new China Business forum in Hebrew who I know indirectly through a colleague and his Meijob.com China online company . It&#8217;s still not very active, but I have a feeling will take care of that soon. I also noticed that his partner, has registered his new blog on Chinalyst. I think that makes 3 Israeli English blogs about China that I know of (after and the somewhat inactive Tel Aviv University will hold a Japan celebration on the 30th of May, which will include a visit from the ambassador and student Japan related performances and songs , whatever that means. I still don&#8217;t have the full details, but on the same night - the 30th of May - there&#8217;s going to be a Korea celebration at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem East-Asia student forum in Tel Aviv University is celebrating two years and holding an " Israeli China Business conference " on June 5th, 17:00 at Drachlis hall (room 496).

They do everything, taking care of the cattle, picking up wood, and ride 40 persons in a truck As a form of entertainement both Koreas will take you to a visit to the border. One mystery remains, how comme under capitalism the roads are good and under communism sh*tty. Sand is where NK is. The road is prepared for an invasion, the big cubes can be pushed on the road to trap the enemy tanks. Just in case they put those things up on every road in the radius of 50km from the border, they are often decorated. They also have those in the mountains. A NK beach, electrified barbed-wire so the NK citiziens wouln't swim away, of couse you're not allowed to take that picture. NK love to show off military trophees, like the american spy ship Pueblo. Pieces of US aicraft in a museum, that are gathered up with a lot of love. NK defends itself not only from imperialist agressors, every neiborhood is defended. Once by a coincidence, he took a picture of that buliding with AC on every window. Of couse he was told that he's not allowd to take the picture. Apperently this is not an ordinary house, maybe scientists live there. On may 1st, the tourists got to see a concert and taekwondo students so everyone would know that the new replacement is growing up. Next , visual culture.

While I&#39;m stuck here, waiting for some thing that might, or might not, work out, I keep wanting to get the hell out of here, but can&#39;t find the strength to do anything. Don&#39;t want to do any last minute shopping, which I know I&#39;ll regret later, I don&#39;t want to talk to anyone, which makes me unusually rude, and I don&#39;t want to see anything, not that there&#39;s much left to see that I haven&#39;t seen before.

Part OF THE IV. Roads and transport. 28 April &#151; on 06 May of 95 years of chuche (2006) Ground-based vestibyuli of the stations of the metro appear completely shabby. Vnutri&#y'0;&#151; tourniquets by height scarcely higher elbow (Koreans, v&#y'0;otlichiye, for example, of ot&#y'0;kitaytsev, all of low increase). Above the escalator descent inscription "yes is in good health general Kim Chen&#y'0;Ir&#y'0;&#151; the sun 21- GO of veka!&#y8";. Escalator is very long. It is illuminated very originally. V&#y'0;sostavakh to po&#y'0;chetyre of railroad car. Doors are opened by hands, are shut automatically. The task was set before the architects of stations: to outdo the classical stations of the Moscow metro. Station hall here of v&#y'0;dva of times higher than our, to a&#y'0;mozaiku by size to so&#y'0;vsyu the travelling wall of my&#y'0;poka also of ne&#y'0;potyanuli. Cities are characterized by the practically complete absence of automobiles. All walk on foot ("very useful each day to go for a walk e0-ya0&#y'0;minut&#y8";), sometimes they drive the na&#y'0;perepolnennom public transport, which consists of iz&#y'0;tramvayev, trolley buses to i&#y'0;dazhe of two-story buses. Bicycle is here luxury it i&#y'0;vstrechayetsya relatively rarely. To po&#y'0;krayney measure, accurately it issue to plying po&#y'0;ulitsam to seksotam (sm.&#y'0; Pedestrian zebra has original dizayn&#y'0;&#151; two strips, interruption, two additional strips, small interruption, among the road three strips, then symmetrical alliteration.

With the fact that usually the road appears as follows: Road signs warn the drivers of o&#y'0;nalichii of zebra by dark-blue sign by s&#y'0;peshekhodom, before which previously is placed the still i&#y'0;zheltyy sign, which warns o&#y'0;sinem. In this case the drivers completely ne&#y'0;ostanavlivayutsya never before the pedestrians. Driving up to k&#y'0;perekhodu, driver begins intensively to buzz, accelerating crowd as the herd of cows.

And he does not know that it is possible to sometimes be inferior to pedestrians. V&#y'0;gorode of pedestrians they force to walk to po&#y'0;dorozhkam to i&#y'0;pol'zovat'sya by zebras. A&#y'0;v&#y'0;selakh all go to po&#y'0;doroge in the manner that as if machines here generally it ne&#y'0;byvayet: U&#y'0;voditeley, v&#y'0;svoyu turn, there is no habit to look v&#y'0;zerkala of the rear of vida&#y'0;&#151; usually there there is no one. Therefore when one machine wants to pass another, it begins intensively bibikat'&#y'0;&#151; otherwise driver from the front nothing ne&#y'0;zametit (for the sake of fairness it is necessary to say that in &#151; the same ). Automobile decouplings are encountered sometimes v&#y'0;sovershenno the unpredictable places. Here this, for example, it is located among the flat field (although it i&#y'0;prokhodit above the railroad): Only indicator to na&#y'0;zapravku was located by next s&#y'0;moyey hotel to v&#y'0;Pkhen'yane. To a&#y'0;v&#y'0;gorode To vonsane driver even dropped in to be filled. Gasoline pump was located za&#160;kakim- that by completely imperceptible fence.

Along the roads are established the sculptural compositions, which call to the k&#y'0;bezavariynoy ride: Na&#y'0;avtobusnykh stoppages are erected the turns of iz&#y'0;tekh, to whom to go home or to na&#y'0;rabotu it is more than half-hour.

In order to go v&#y'0;drugoye place, it is necessary to shape something of the type of mission. Therefore na&#y'0;vsekh roads stand KPP. Check points are equipped with winches na&#y'0;kolesikakh. My driver began previously to buzz to i&#y'0;migat' with headlights to soldier so that that would roll away the gates. To po&#y'0;vsey visibility, by the headlights of na&#y'0;KPP they blink, when to v&#y'0;mashine foreigner in order not to confuse guest by the procedures of formal checkings. Light signals to v&#y'0;gorode are encountered, tyuey no&#y'0;ne&#y'0;rabotayut. The only working light signal is established opposite the entrance of v&#y'0;mavzoley Kim Ir&#y'0;Sena.

It is not possible to remove this entirely, it was necessary even to erase this photograph on the eyes in the guide: Among the motor park there are Japanese i&#160;hjno- Korean models. No&#y'0;otdel'no rushes v&#y'0;glaza a quantity of Mercedes, which are here known exclusively by the name Benz (Asian tradition). Bents&#y'0;&#151; the dear machine of North Korean leaders.

They instead of give receipt to na&#y'0;risovoy paper. They bring telephone conversely before the departure. There is no rouminga, naturally,; therefore signal to na&#y'0;telefone ne&#y'0;otobrazhayetsya. Of no&#y'0;esli to pass by v&#y'0;ruchnoy the selection of network, is proposed operator PRK 03.

The impression, which will remain u&#y'0;turista of ot&#y'0;poseshcheniya of the country, greatly disturbs the assuming side. It is necessary to scatter all myths o&#y'0;tom, as to v&#y'0;Severnoy Korea everything is bad. To the v&#y'0;Pkhen'yanskeye hotel television set shows BBC, pair of the Chinese channels of i&#y'0;NTV&#y'0;&#151; you ne&#y'0;pozhaluyesh'sya na&#y'0;ogranicheniye of freedom THE MEDIA. They feed sytno&#y'0;&#151; you ne&#y'0;pozhaluyesh'sya na&#y'0;golod. By analog of our expression "v&#y'0;perekhode&#y8"; here it appears "under mostom&#y8";. Basic life occurs under the bridges. There petty private traders sell cigarettes i&#160;kakuh- that food, there stand poor. If v&#y'0;stolitse under the bridge is still sufficiently proper, the to&#y'0;v&#y'0;sel'skoy locality of people there it is gathered as to na&#y'0;vokzale. Noted ya&#y'0;eto completely randomly, when road was bent, after revealing the picture, which usually ne&#y'0;vidno of s&#y'0;dorogi entirely. The v&#y'0;Pkhen'yanskikh parks are encountered elderly women, which collect v&#y'0;parkakh some grass v&#y'0;polietilenovye packets. They ne&#y'0;pokhozhi of na&#y'0;otryady of pioneers, who pull out weeds along the highway. Guide it explained that "they collect grass for the rabbits of doma&#y8";. Although it is completely obvious that goes the search only for that grass, which it is possible to use v&#y'0;pishchu to masters "krolika&#y8";. One time of ya&#y'0;popytalsya to roll up the s&#y'0;proverennoy path, accelerated step so that the guides would remain, i&#y'0;svernul into the depths of the block of habitable buildings. Ne&#y'0;uspel to pass to i&#y'0;dvadtsati is meter, as road to me barred seksot to na&#y'0;velosipede of i&#y'0;ob"yasnil&#y'0;&#151; road there there, a&#y'0;syuda cannot be gone. Vo&#y'0;vsekh the places of the stoppages of foreigners (for example, to v&#y'0;chaynoy po&#y'0;doroge of v&#y'0;drugoy city) are located the small birches -Torgsiny of s&#y'0;"privychnymi&#y8"; by the goods: Chinese sprayt, Japanese cold coffee v&#y'0;bankakh, beer, snikersy, the cigarettes of i&#y'0;t.&#y'0;p. By the v&#y'0;odnoy of iz&#y'0;takikh benches to na&#y'0;beregu of Sea of Japan were revealed even two bundles of potato chips Lay's, the period of fitness of which ended to v&#y'0;200y&#y'0;godu. To ne&#y'0;znayu, as buy Koreans, v&#y'0;Torgsinakh the principle of trade is the following: you select goods, salesman extracts check, s&#y'0;chekom you go to v&#y'0;kassu by s&#y'0;shchelyami, where ne&#y'0;prolezayet hand, pay by the currency (are taken Euro-, dollars or yuan), cashier is stamped check, it tears off half. By ty&#y'0;s&#y'0;etoy half you go to k&#y'0;prodavtsu you i&#y'0;zabirayesh' purchase. Street trade accessible for the observation is modest. V&#y'0;osnovnom, this is lemonade. Single-time cups issue to foreigners, fellow citizens be satisfied by the china circles, which wash after use to v&#y'0;vedre or to the basin (there is no illusion of the connected water pipe, which was created to v&#y'0;avtomate of s&#y'0;gazirovkoy v&#y'0;svoye time). V&#y'0;mestakh, where the foreigners ne&#y'0;ozhidayut, v&#y'0;nalichii only circles. They sometimes sell any vegetables. Ni&#y'0;v&#y'0;odin usual store to visit ne&#y'0;udalos', because stoppages to po&#y'0;trebovaniyu of u&#y'0;turista it ne&#y'0;byvayet. The na&#y'0;etom photograph to the right the door of v&#y'0;magazin, which shut srazu&#y'0;zhe, as they noted me. To prove to be the v&#y'0;etom place of ya&#y'0;smog only because za&#y'0;moyey of spinoy&#y'0;&#151; the sanctioned book store (by v&#y'0;kotorom, k&#y'0;moyemu to pleasure, can be smoked, until you study the books). For the northern Korean white chelovek&#y'0;&#151; as negro by v&#y'0;rozovom, immediately turns na&#y'0;sebya attention. The local residents of do&#y'0;kontsa ne&#y'0;veryat, that they met living foreigner. The reaction of people is always such: It is necessary to note that the ideological training of guide leaves much to be desired. Po&#y'0;ideye, must be although dodgy, no&#y'0;otvet na&#y'0;lyuboy a question. However, the answers of u&#y'0;gida are only na&#y'0;voprosy of iz&#y'0;spravochnika for the internal use. Nonstandard questions cause either the change of the theme of conversation or is simple silence. Then vo&#y'0;vremya of trips v&#y'0;drugiye of city adapts the following tactics. As soon as machine it approaches to the k&#y'0;naselennomu point, guide begins to pose the questions of o&#y'0;chem-nibud', in order to ty&#y'0;otvleksya of i&#y'0;ne&#y'0;fotografiroval that ne&#y'0;nado. If we compare way of life, details of i&#y'0;realii s&#y'0;tem, that is known to iz&#y'0;istorii, to&#y'0;mozhno to determine time, by v&#y'0;kotorom lives northern Koreya&#y'0;&#151; this is y9shch0&#y'0;god. Even very well greased i&#y'0;nastroyennaya machine of time ne&#y'0;zabrosit v&#y'0;proshloye so accurately. Na&#y'0;ulitsakh here cost gypsum of statui&#y'0;&#151; without the repelled hands i&#y'0;ne&#y'0;pochernevshiye. Flat of i&#y'0;bez of the phials of glass to make another ne&#y'0;nauchilis'&#y'0;&#151; absolutely vo&#y'0;vsekh houses they uneven. Exception are windows v&#y'0;gostinitsakh the i&#y'0;bol'shiye shop windows. There is no gasoline to v&#y'0;strane almost; therefore practically entire labor of manual. Tractors is small i&#y'0;vse terrible. They plough the Earth by plow. V&#y'0;stolitse water pipe, po&#y'0;vsey visibility works, the a&#y'0;v&#y'0;prigranichnom city Of keson (entirely ne&#y'0;derevnya to po&#y'0;vidu) of woman they erase na&#y'0;rechke. Town-building principle is simple: along all large motor roads by dense wall cost the pre-fabricated houses. If we suddenly ne&#y'0;uspeli shut with high house one-storeyed building, is placed concrete fence without the slots so that nothing besides the roofs ne&#y'0;bylo is evident. Any attempts to photograph anything, being differed ot&#y'0;kartinok to v&#y'0;zhurnale "Koreya&#y8";, they immediately criticize by the guide: "why vy&#y'0;eto of fotografiruyete?&#y8";, "to here remove ne&#y'0;rekomenduyetsya&#y8";, i&#y'0;pr. Koreans completely ne&#y'0;smushchayutsya natural requirements. On the rural roads frequently it is possible to meet peasants, pisayushchikh to v&#y'0;storonu cuvette. V&#y'0;kusty ne&#y'0;otkhodyat. If we to v&#y'0;derevne to me remove this peasant of ne&#y'0;razreshili, to&#y'0;v&#y'0;Pkhen'yane, na&#y'0;rasstoyanii of 300 are meter ot&#y'0;monumenta of the ideas of chuche, no one to photograph ne&#y'0;meshal (attention to na&#y'0;lestnitsu): A&#y'0;vot to i&#y'0;sam the monument of the ideas of chuche (lift of k&#y'0;ognyu&#y'0;&#151; shch&#y'0;evro). Sense of these ideas v&#y'0;tom, that "chelovek&#y'0;&#151; the owner in all, on&#y'0;reshayet vse&#y8";. Further the iz&#y'0;etogo principle emerges the fact that it is necessary to be to independent, a&#y'0;esli of u&#y'0;nas is the entire country of independent people, to to&#y'0;nam anyone ne&#y'0;nuzhen. So the principle "of resting na&#y'0;sobstvennye of sily&#y8"; is converted v&#y'0;opravdaniye of the absolute closed nature of the country of ot&#y'0;vneshnego peace. V&#y'0;yy&#y'0;chasov the power supply they cease, i&#y'0;monument it costs the v&#y'0;kromeshnoy dark. Night city appears sufficiently to pugayushche. Better comparison, incoming v&#y'0;golovu, &#y'0;&#151; this is night sky. Streets, naturally, ne&#y'0;osveshchayutsya. Windows are similar na&#y'0;zvezdy. City ne&#y'0;dayet reflection. Entire matter v&#y'0;tom, that are here forbidden the lamps of nakalivaniya&#y'0;&#151; u&#y'0;vsekh will hang the energy-saving spirals, which give the disgusting white surgical light (v&#y'0;gostinitse, by the way, the normal lamps of vkrucheny). Ni&#y'0;v&#y'0;odnom window of ya&#y'0;ne&#y'0;videl of abazhura&#y'0;&#151; naked lamps will hang under the ceiling. There are no blinds also, only tulle these are the form of Pyongyang, the capital after all. To a&#y'0;v&#y'0;gorode Of vonsan of light at night generally ne&#y'0;bylo. In the daytime elevator to v&#y'0;monumente got stuck tyuey na&#y'0;yshch&#y'0;minut. S&#y'0;vysoty of the base of the fire of the ideas of chuche it is not possible to reveal one-storeyed building, only form of na&#y'0;rabochego, the collective farmer of i&#y'0;intelligenta (s&#y'0;kist'yu v&#y'0;ruke). To i&#y'0;eshche dead birds lie, whom s&#y'0;takoy height it is incomprehensible as to shake off. Then reality it ne&#y'0;udalos' to disguise s&#y'0;vysoty of tele-tower. Road thus appears, by po&#y'0;kotoroy convey foreigners (to the left vnizu)&#y'0;&#151; everything is forced by houses. To no&#y'0;v&#y'0;glubine begin the regions, where never ne&#y'0;stupala the foot of foreigner. I&#y'0;tak&#y'0;&#151; za&#y'0;gorizont. "Pkhen'yan&#y'0;&#151; city -park&#187;. Guide, after forbidding this to photograph, explains: "U&#y'0;nas old men ne&#y'0;khotyat to cross v&#y'0;novye houses, im&#y'0;nravitsya so zhit'&#y8";. By the way, to v&#y'0;Severnoy Korea to v&#y'0;y99"&#y'0;godu to po&#y'0;sluchayu of the 3rd anniversary of so&#y'0;dnya of decease Kim Ir&#y'0;Sena (earlier than ne&#y'0;soobrazili) birthday Kim Ir&#y'0;Sena of yshch&#y'0;aprelya is declared by the holiday of the sun i&#y'0;vvedeno chuchkheyskoye chronology, incipient s&#y'0;y9y2&#y'0;goda (year of its generation). Is good although yshch&#y'0;aprelya of ne&#y'0;sdelali in the daytime of new year. Separate stronghold of marazma&#y'0;&#151; the mausoleum of the great leader of comrade Kim Ir&#y'0;Sena (Kymsusanskiy memorial palace). You first pass generally all (except glasses of i&#y'0;chasov) v&#y'0;garderob. It is necessary to be buttoned to na&#y'0;vse of button to i&#y'0;vyglyadet' strictly. Then you penetrate the roentgen (although nowhere it ne&#y'0;soobshchayetsya, that this of roentgens). Then through the metal detector. Then necessary to go is meter '00&#y'0;na&#y'0;travelatore. Then you rise to na&#y'0;lifte you i&#y'0;popadayesh' v&#y'0;zal, where stands enormous statue Kim Ir&#y'0;Sena by s&#y'0;interesnoy gradient illumination (statue white, the background from behind of vnizu&#y'0;&#151; red, sverkhu&#y'0;&#151; dark-blue). Above the elevators is established for some purpose Wi-Fie- transmitter. Following zal&#y'0;&#151; strictly, s&#y'0;mumiyey. They approach by troikas, they go around by around po&#y'0;chasovoy, bow so&#y'0;vsekh of sides, besides head. This it is not possible to call "poseshcheniyem&#y8";, this is "vizit&#y8";. Because Kim Ir&#y'0;Sen is more living than all living. You then get down v&#y'0;zal by the s&#y'0;bronzovymi bas reliefs, which depict grief of the Korean people of v&#y'0;svyazi of s&#y'0;konchinoy great leader. They here issue dictophone Sony s&#y'0;zapisannoy na&#y'0;russkom by speech. It memorized two phrases: "it seemed the terrestial globe lost its mass to ot&#y'0;tyazhesti utraty&#y8"; i&#y'0;chto, after learning o&#y'0;konchine of leader, "entire Korean people cried bloody of slezami&#y8";. Guide it knew the Russian language sufficiently badly. A&#y'0;inogda, when heard an unpleasant question, made form, which ne&#y'0;znayet entirely. Before the visit of the monument of the great leader of comrade Kim Ir&#y'0;Sena necessary to purchase bouquet is color za&#y'0;tri of Euro-, to place to his k&#y'0;osnovaniyu of monument, to go away to i&#y'0;poklonit'sya. All this ya&#y'0;delal to the v&#y'0;Novikovskoy football shirt, which appears innocently with the quick reading. Guide it photographed.

http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/07/07/hopes-and-fears-the-missile-era/	Hopes and fears : the missile era | fiLi&#8217;s world Asia knocking on my door Friday, July 7th, 2006...5:30 pm Hopes and fears : the missile era Domestic news contain endless discussions of whether the Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza strip has proved a complete failure since Israeli cities are now being bombed daily with small man-held missiles-rockets (Shderot and lately, Ashkelon). Together with the deadly Hamas attack, the Israeli soldier being taken hostage by the Hamas, and the Israeli decision to go back into Gaza, everything is just a total disaster. It seems like everybody&#39;s completely lost . Some Asian friends have mailed me recently asking me if everything is okay over here, wondering how I&#39;m doing, and making sure the Gilad person who was taken isn&#39;t me (as we have the same Israeli first name :D). My response is - I can&#39;t keep up with it all, I don&#39;t get it, I give up. I have to block everything to keep sane. In the international section of the news, America and the Asian countries are fearing the missile testing by North Korea. I always fear a situation in which America is fearing something or someone, because it usually follows with extreme action. If China is now a great capitalist friend, then North Korea is the current extreme threat. I t doesn&#39;t matter that the missile launch failed miserably , it&#39;s the concept that matters - leaders say. There&#39;s finally something that allows uniting S. Korea, China, Japan, Australia and the US. War and a threat brings such harmony and collaboration, isn&#39;t it wonderful? On the Taiwanese side, Michael Turton writes about another missile test that I personally didn&#39;t hear about, planned by Taiwan to maintain the balance of power with the hundreds of missiles in China aiming at the Taiwanese island. I can&#39;t imagine what would happen if the Israel-Palestinian situation would occur over there. (Come to think of it, I do like to think that Israel is a more of Taiwan than China with the huge surrounding hostile countries, but you can make that reverse comparison as well, I guess) It&#39;s all so surreal. I just hate the news. (Here&#39;s a cartoon posted in Haaretz&#39;s Thursday addition, which I found after writing this post :$.

http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/09/23/the-magic-of-chinese-cuisine/	The magic of Chinese cuisine | fiLi&#8217;s world Taiwan openly addressing independence from China Going back in time - Taiwanese and Chinese history explored Saturday, September 23rd, 2006...12:15 am The magic of Chinese cuisine I&#39;m still a rookie when it comes to Chinese cuisine, but the few steps that I&#39;ve taken in the road to Chinese food enlightenment have been a real treat. I believe the closest that I got to having a full Chinese meal was last year&#39;s Chinese new years with Vanina&#39;s family and that was a glorious meal. Trying out a different thing dish everyday in Taipei has brought a few interesting experiences, but was mostly an extraordinary delight. What is the Chinese cuisine? Hmmm&#8230; I can&#39;t really lay out the characteristics, but it&#39;s pretty simple for me to make it out when I see it, and it&#39;s quite distinguishable from Korean and Japanese cuisines. A meal in Chinese culture is typically seen as consisting of two or more general components: (1) a carbohydrate source or starch, known as ä¸»é£ in the Chinese language, (zhÇsh&iacute; Pinyin , lit. "main food", staple) - typically rice (with rice vinegar for consistency), noodles, or mantou (steamed buns), and (2) accompanying dishes of vegetables, fish, meat, or other items, known as è (c&agrave;iPinyin , lit. "vegetable") in the Chinese language. (This cultural conceptualization is in some ways in contrast to Western meals where meat or animal protein is often considered the main dish.) ( What does it look like? Here&#39;s the opening scene from one of my all-times favorite movies - The Taiwanese Eat Drink Man Woman How do I eat? Chopsticks are the primary eating utensil in Chinese culture for solid foods, while soups and other liquids are enjoyed [1] with a wide, flat-bottomed spoon (traditionally made of ceramic). [&#8230;] In most dishes in Chinese cuisine, food is prepared in bite-sized pieces (e.g. vegetable, meat, doufu), ready for direct picking up and eating. In a Chinese meal, each individual diner is given his or her own bowl of rice while the accompanying dishes are served in communal plates (or bowls) that are shared by everyone sitting at the table, a communal service known as "family style" in Western nations. In the Chinese meal, each diner picks food out of the communal plates on a bite-by-bite basis with their chopsticks. [&#8230;] Besides soup, if any other beverages are served, they would most likely be hot tea or hot water. What does a meal look like? Here a fast-forward version : Will I like it? Well, I&#39;m quite sure you&#39;ll like the easy basic stuff, though I&#39;ve met a few foreigners in Asia that would eat nothing but McDonalds and KFC. It&#39;s the more hardcore stuff that&#39;s interesting and some of it could prove a real challenge even for the most adventurous foreigners. (Written in response to a few requests from friends and readers to write a bit on Chinese food) Asia-Israel news and events - March 07 China and Taiwan Forums List &#8220;Magical Taiwan&#8221; Exhibition in Jerusalem One small step for a man&#8230; A Chinese dinner in Jerusalem Asia-Israel news and events - March 07 | fiLi&#8217;s world [&#8230;] More Taiwanese and Chinese movies coming up as well.

http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/06/04/opportunities/	Opportunities | fiLi&#8217;s world Sunday, June 4th, 2006...11:56 am It&#8217;s no big secret that I&#8217;m currently searching for opportunities to head back out of Israel. Let&#8217;s just say that it&#8217;s on my mind constantly. It&#8217;s not that I hate it here, it&#8217;s not that everything is bad, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;d rather experience something less&#8230; eh&#8230; familiar. There are two preferred methods by which that might be achieved: First option is by pursuing a PhD with a university abroad. That proves to be very problematic now, since all applications and scholarships deadlines for the next academic year have ended a while back (around February-March). I assumed that it would be easier for PhDs, as it is in Israel, but I was wrong. Second course of action is relocating through an Israeli IT company, something which I&#8217;ve been unsuccessfully attempting to find. The real turndown is that the companies that I write to seeking relocation positions sometimes offer me very attractive offers for positions in Israel that I feel as though I should be grateful for and accept, but can never bring myself to do it just now. I can&#8217;t even remember all the offers I rejected, and I hope that will not come back to haunt me. Academic year in Israel is ending soon, and then there won&#8217;t even be any Chinese studies anymore. I hope I&#8217;ll figure out soon what&#8217;s next&#8230; Israel-China Trade Reaching New Heights Far East day at the Hebrew University A Muslim and a Jew Click here to cancel "reply".

http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/11/18/upf-an-odd-japanese-meeting-in-jerusalem/	UPF : An odd Japanese meeting in Jerusalem | fiLi&#8217;s world The Israel Invasion : Chinese companies doing business in Israel National Cultures : Differences and similarities between East and West Saturday, November 18th, 2006...1:04 pm UPF : An odd Japanese meeting in Jerusalem &ldquo;Eh, yes yes, he-he-hello&hellip; you fiLi? fiLi yes?&rdquo; I thought I knew this voice from somewhere, but couldn&#8217;t quite place it. I don&rsquo;t get that many phone calls in English, but my online and Asia activities do bring me the occasional strange calls &ndash; &ldquo;yep, that&rsquo;s me&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes yes, very. Eh-oh-eh this is Tatakinakamo speaking, you &ndash; yes &ndash; you remember &ndash; remember come me?&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes, yes, remember, okay okay. You okay?&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m great. Do I know you?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes, okay. I am UPF, come to you, you give me, right?&rdquo; I kept silent for a few moments, trying to recall anything that would explain this phonecall. It took about 20 second to remember the no-English Japanese girl who knocked on my door one day asking for donations for the Japanese/Korean World-Peace Federation held in Jerusalem every year or so. &ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re the Japanese girl from the peace organization. This is a surprise. So you&rsquo;re still in Israel, eh? How are you doing?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, very good. So so. Yes. I want to, eh-oh-eh, we like visit your family. Meet family, talk peace. Peace, yes?&rdquo; Although my family does talk and care about peace &ndash; or lack of &ndash; quite often, I just couldn&rsquo;t picture the situation, especially with what seems like a massive language barrier. &ldquo;What do you mean? What would you like to talk about?&rdquo; &ldquo;Oh, yes, many peace.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;s possible. May I ask how many people you called so far? Did you visit anybody already?&rdquo; &ldquo;No, no. Can not. I don&rsquo;t tell you. So can not, not?&rdquo; I detect some cultural gaps as well. She sounded like what I asked really offended her. &ldquo;I will be honest with you&rdquo; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in meeting with your organization, because I would like to know more about Japanese people in Israel, but my family may not share my curiousity&rdquo;. She didn&rsquo;t understand, I repeated the sentence slowly. &ldquo;Oh, I see, I see. Then only you? Yes?&rdquo; And so I got a few other phone calls, all taking a long time to communicate and reach somesort of an understanding. I was very impressed by this girl&rsquo;s motivation to promote somesort of an agenda which I didn&rsquo;t understand in a Hebrew speaking country using very bad English. I tried asking her a few times how she feels about her job but that always seemed to embarrass her. We eventually set to meet in a house, 5 minutes walk from my own, which is the UPF head-quarters. I really didn&rsquo;t know what they want from me and what I should expect. I met the Japanese girl at their center and she invited me to sit down and wait for her friend while I read a bit about their lectures regarding world love and world peace. I read one brochure, then another, then a magazine, but I still couldn&rsquo;t understand what the organization was about. It seemed well-funded and well-established with photos of all sorts of Israeli politicians coming in to their events, but reading through the material it sometimes felt like some sort of a cult with a spiritual message that boarded religion. It was quite strange. Then came the friend, who to my relief spoke much better English, and then she asked me what I wanted to hear about. I explained that I have no idea what I was doing there, I&rsquo;m not even sure what the organization is about and that the only reason I&rsquo;m there is because I was curious to meet with them, as Asians who live in Israel. I went further to show them I can read some Chinese characters in their Japanese leaflets, and told them that I&rsquo;m a student with the East-Asia department at the Hebrew University. The friend seemed very pleased and so we spent about half an hour saying how much we like each other&rsquo;s areas of the world. What was especially fascinating was that the reason why she likes Israel and tries to promote Israel in Japanese media and the reason why I like Asia so much and try to promote Asia with my Israeli acquaintances was quite the same. For her, Japan was too materialistic and familiar, with very little spirit with people sometimes following tradition and costumes without &ldquo;belief&rdquo; just because &ldquo;it was always so&rdquo;. Israel, and especially Jerusalem, seemed like the center of good-will and belief to her, quite different from anything that she&rsquo;s ever experienced before. I made the exact same case only from the opposite side. Visiting Asia I felt human spirituality that was very different from the harsh every-day reality of the somewhat western-materialistic somewhat direct-power oriented Israeli reality. I immediately felt at home with the open and friendly people that I&rsquo;ve met even though I was a complete stranger. In Asia I kept wondering what a foreigner would feel like in Israel, and was worried that we Israelis would not bestow such hospitality. I was glad to hear from the Japanese lady that she feels here just as I did living in Taiwan and Vietnam. The last part of the meeting was odd, and might reflect on some of the cultural mis-understandings. The lady did what I considered to be a promotion for some Korean Ginseng tea. She gave me some leaflets to read, explained for about 15 minutes where the Ginseng is from and what it does to the body, stating that &ldquo;Korean Ginseng is the best quality, and that is why it is most expensive&rdquo; and then invited me to taste a hand made Korean Ginsend Tea. When I tried to speed thing up asking whether she wants to sell it to me she was taken back and responded with a null confusing &ldquo;oh, no no, we don&rsquo;t try to sell it for profit, we just try to help make the world happy and healthy&rdquo;. Before we parted, the friend commented that I seem like I come from a very good family and that she would love to come and talk to my family. I said that I&rsquo;ll ask. Although I&rsquo;ve spent almost 3 hours with the two Japanese ladies, I still have no idea why they invited me and what they want from me, nor do I know anything about their organization. Looking at their website , the organization seems to be something serious with a clear message, but the whole experience has me confused. Maybe it is just cultural differences, I really can&rsquo;t say. China furious after Israeli officials visit Taiwan Jerusalem - the Rehavia tour Asia knocking on my door Culture : comparing Israeli and Japanese flights The Korean Center in Jerusalem I&#8217;m fairly certain that the Universal Peace Federation is one of Sun Myung Moon&#8217;s many organizations.

The report ranks every country on a seven point scale in two categories - "political rights" (PR) and "civil liberties" (CL), 1 being the highest and 7 the lowest. To make it easier for you, I&#39;ll give the rankings for the East Asian countries from best ranked to lowest, first score is PR followed by CL and the change from last year (up for improvement, down for getting worse) : Taiwan : 1, 1 Japan : 1, 2 South Korea : 1, 2 Mongolia : 2, 2 India : 2, 3 Thailand : 3, 3 Philippines : 3, 3 Malaysia : 4, 4 Singapore : 5, 4 Brunei : 6, 5 Cambodia : 6 ,5 Nepal : 6, 5 (down) Vietnam : 7, 5 China : 7, 6 (down) Laos : 7, 6 Burma : 7, 7 North Korea : 7, 7 (BTW - and &#8230; Israel : 1 ,2 (up)) Full report "Worst of the Worst: The World&#39;s Most Repressive Societies 2006" can be found here : Bribe Payers Index 2006 : Asia Competitiveness 2006: Singapore, Japan, HK and Taiwan lead Asian ranking Hopes and fears : the missile era A peek into North Korea The top universities in Asia 2006 : An update Dalian China Information Guide Wow.

Yet they make a strong argument in their papers to form what seems to be a solid case, and most of it makes lots of sense.

Most Israelis I talk to about Taiwan, my Asian home, either confuse it with Thailand or they have no idea what and where Taiwan is. That has a lot to do with the fact that Taiwan is rarely promoted or discussed in Israel anywhere outside the newspapers&#8217; business sections. Today, in Jerusalem&#8217;s "City Mouse", the leading magazine for things to do around Jerusalem, there was a piece about a new exhibition in Jerusalem. Here&#8217;s a quick translation from Hebrew : Exhibition - a rice paradise The magic of Taiwan sweeps the campus Here&#8217;s something beautiful and magical - Today, a new photography exhibition titled "Magical Taiwan" will open at the Belgium House (Beit Belgia) in the Givat Ram (Hebrew University) campus, accompanied by Chinese music and food. The exhibition will include 40 scenic photos of Taiwan taken by "the best photographers in Taiwan" says Yael Golan, the assistant of the Department of Culture of the Taiwanese office in Israel, who&#8217;s in charge of the exhibition. "On the map, or looking at Taiwan from outerspace, Taiwan appears as a small country, by in the eyes of a nature explorer, Taiwan is a paradise of beauty" explains Golan. "Taiwan lies on an island in the Pacific Ocean, east of the Asian mainland. The beaches, the cliffs and the small islands allow the traveler to enjoy the gorgeous views formed when land and sea meet. In Taiwan, one can enjoy the life in big modern cities as well as enjoy peaceful little villages high on the mountains. Taiwan is rich with views that aren&#8217;t typical of the west and anybody visiting will enjoy a warm welcome of the locals. The "Magical Taiwan" exhibition allows the Israelis a small peek into the views, the culture and the people of this country". The Belgium House, Givat Ram Hebrew University campus, opening : Friday, 1.12, 12:00. Closing : Thursday, 4.1, 20:00 (free entrance) We should go and have a look.

Another shot of the hotel Monument to soiviet soldiers Another wedding and one of the tourists A park in Pyongyang View of Pyongyang from Moran Hill Central House of the Youth The School Uniform exists but its not toally respected Soldiers, and they have to serve 6 years... Favorite pose of koreans during a conversation Apperently there is no etiquette in the subway, you don't h ave to let people out before you get in. Pioneers and students palace Probably that escalator that was turned on just for the visitors Tourists, there were a lot of europeans during the concert Monument of the foundation of the workers party ( Benz :P) View from the center You can see the unfinished hotel, it's still unknown why they abandoned it , since other buldings were build The super momument, everyone who comes to see it bows It's a mystery why it's so clean, also i guess that shot would be concidered illegal since you dont see the whole statue A street next to the Kim il Song monument Congress palace i think Apprerently there is also a protestant chrurch in Pyongyang Marble slabs commemorating different organisations and people friendly to NK View from the Jurche monument ( the one that has dead birds :P) A night (before they turn off the light) A street in Pyongyang People and a BENZ!!! No one forbid him to take that picture He said that people were curious as in " wow a white person" We have visited a local department store. Our girls did not want to take us there (" We don't usually take foreigners to local stores , but we insisted. As they say, there is nothing to hide. If only from the Americans and Europeans :. It was a regular large department store from the Soviet times, honest (i.e. without signs in English). As far as food, every thing is not so good (eggs, meat, and something else can only be bought with coupons), other consumer goods are easier to get. For the most part, the merchandise is imported (from China), and quite pricy. Roughly speaking, to buy a regular jacket, a simple Engineer or Interpreter will have to save money for a few months. Approximately the way it was in the Soviet Union. The saleswomen are obviously different from those in the foreign currency stores (where girls are clearly selected by age, height, and attractiveness). Though, rudeness is apparently not acceptable in Korea, regardless of the status of the store. The shoppers are common people - both workers and engineers and technical workers. They don't buy very much, mostly look and compare prices before their holiday shopping. In the musical instruments department, someone was playing a piano, put out for sale. Needless to say, the people in this store were looking at us not even with astonishment and curiosity (like on the streets), but as if we were a hallucination There was an interesting moment when Alexey had trouble falling asleep and went out of the hotel at 6 in the morning to some random neighborhood. No one stopped him.He walked for about three kilometers, and was finally stopped by a policeman, who asked him for identification (in Korean, naturally). Since, first of all he didn't have identification, and second he knew but a few words in Korean, they could not reach an understanding. A crowd gathered around them quickly (they don't meet foreigners in residential quarters very often and finally there was someone, who knew the word "Russian". That was what he asked Alexey, and Alexey said "yes". After that the feelings got warmer, the policeman took down his name, and let him go. There were no consequences. Painter in the park A quite common sight is a person or several people gathering seeds of some weed on the lawn. In the background - an ice cream sale. In regards to North Korea, one can not talk about any freedom of speech. Apparently there hasn't been any political change; the government is still in control of the situation in the country. However there have been economic changes. The foreign currency stores (in the picture) are more widespread. That is to say that (by hearsay) they existed here since the mid-70's, and locals were not denied access to them. The selection in the stores is wide, especially when it comes to food. It's a little worse with the industrial goods. The modern electronics are pretty expansive (for instance, a SD/MMC card costs about twice as much as in St. Petersburg). I saw some Koreans in the store (they were well to do of course), there are no noticeable checks or restrictions at the entrance. Now there are joint businesses with foreigners - restaurants. A restaurant can only be owned by a foreigner - for example Japanese (see a photo above, where a waitress is playing an instrument). The local population can work for a foreign owner, but can not own the restaurant. Not a bad way to keep the economy under control. In the picture: The Koreans are shy of carrying their babies behind their back sometimes. As I was told, the South Koreans do this also, however this is "countryside style". Also, I heard that as a result of being carried this way, children's legs can often get disfigured. Also, there are cooperatives. In the North Korean version, a cooperative is a team, which produces some articles (for instance, collects and dries cochlea beer snack, or makes chewing gum), sells them, and splits up the profit equally among all the members. The types of business and products are limited, and a state license is required. The result is approximately the same as in our country in the late 1980's: the selection in the cooperative stores is wider than in the state owned stores, but the prices are considerably higher. The cooperative products are usually of a lower quality than those in the state owned stores (sometimes it's enough to look at the package to realize that). A short distance from the town is the Hyangsang Hotel where we stayed during our visit to Myohyang. A revolving restaurant is at the top. It features very scenic views. map in the hotel hall. The main attraction in these mountains is the abundance of waterfalls. The river you see here passes by the hotel and has the same name as the mountains - Myohyan With about 200 large halls and the splendor the palace is comparable to the Hermitage (with the exception of the style of architecture and the modern building materials, of course). No cameras are allowed (I think this is the only place in North Korea, where we could not take pictures  all possessions have to be left in lockers. Inside are valuable presents given to Kim-Ir-Sen. I must note that all the exhibits are really interesting. That is, all items are either works of art or interesting in other ways (for instance a train car given to Kim-Ir-Sen by Stalin in 1946). From modern Russia I noticed: 1. Painting of Vasilievskiy Island Point given by Putin. 2. A silver service given by Putin also. 3. A plate given by the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service. Also there are rifles and other items given by Stalin, Khruschev, Brejnev We were very impressed by a large landscape with trees and buildings, neatly carved out of ivory by Chinese craftsmen. In general, I would say, Chinese gave the most interesting and accurately crafted gifts. Among the givers were also the leaders of South Korea, South Korean companies  for example the president of Daewoo gave Kim-Ir-Sen a car. Notice that the Kalashnikovs are nickel plated. The doors are one-piece bronze, weighing several ton each. One can open them by hand (the guide gives out a special glove to pull on the handle , but the weight is considerable. This is the second building, the presents to Kim-Chen-Ir. It is much more modest both outside and inside. It is also smaller. Most striking is a wax statue of Kim-Ir-Sen in the middle of artificial meadow surrounded by birch trees with sky in the background. The tree leaves even move with the artificial wind coming from a fan. The lighting is well designed, and the whole thing looks real. I think it was also given by the Chinese. One small thing to note: its strange, but I noticed that practically all the buildings in the country (regardless of their status and decor) have A local tour guide. Here we asked the driver to stop the car and I took some pictures. This village doesn't look very well-being, there're some more decent. Also it's not so characteristic: buildings stands irregularly. Obelisk" on a background - is a feature, necessary for all settlements. Usually the neutral, simple slogan is written there (a challenge to work and learn better and so on). Machines typical for village - GAZ (probably made in Northern Korea, not in Russia) and a lorry - with gas generator. This car works with firewood, but I have to underline, that it's NOT a steam machine, but GAS-generator (Usual internal combustion engine, just re-made). It's not gasoline, of course, so the max speed is about 20-30 km per hour. The firewood (at the right) are prepared for lorry. They're put by portions into the can (is seen in the back of a lorry) and slowly burn there. We've seen such machines about five times in general. The roofs are usually made of tiles or something like that. nd this is the more typical Northern Korea village. Houses are identical, located by uniform group, usually in parallel or straight lines. If mountains prevents, then houses locates by few groups on both sides of the mountain. The one more curious moment - about cellular communication. It exists (not less than GSM), but for foreigners it does not operate (no roaming). More of that, the girls told us that it's forbidden to take the mobile phone into the country (on border it will be taken from you, on departure it'll be given back). But I have taken phone without questions, and have written about it to declarations, and on the way back the frontier-guard has seen it. Certainly, it was not possible to speak by phone, but I knew the one curious thing: everywhere we've been (quite a big area) - the network of cellular communication also was everywhere, stably half of a scale (I shall remind - here's a hilly country). Though I did not see any base stations. Maybe, they mask them as mountains? Not long ago I heard in Russian TV news, that mobile phones were taken away from Northern Korea people. Hah! They should've thought what they invent! How could any Korean have cellular phone, when for the sum which there's a mobile phone costs, here it's possible to live about a year? : Abundantly clear, that this service at the moment is only for militarians and officials of a decent level. And there's no point to take mobile phones from them (it's easier to turn off the base stations). A notice: the houses in russian villages are usually decorated, decorations on the wicket-gates, fences, carved window-frames and so on. Although, the house can be leaned-over : I didn't see anything like that in Korea. I mean, village houses are not decorated at all. I've been told later, that south-korean villages look the same way as northern. In Korea (and maybe, in the East in general) the traditional way of heating in the houses is not the same as in Russia. They don't install ovens. Near the house there is something like a hole where coal or fire wood is pawned. The warmed air goes through under the floor and heats the house. Probably, it is connected with tradition to sit on a floor. This system is still used. Not only in villages, but also in guide's cabin near any distant sightseeing. What is not clear for me in this system - and how about an intoxication, a smoke and other? Probably, the cement factory nd this is the modern settlement. The structure is similar, but houses already more thorough. Moreover, want to admit, that in Russia such houses appears when the village grows to larger settlement. Here it is not like that. By it's size, it's still a village, just the houses are modern. Under a polyethylene film - the rice grows By the writing 106% it is possible to assume, that it is a question about exceeding the plan And here we went out without support and have decided to take a walk . At first we've walked along the embankment. (where is the electrified fence???) Alexey tries to buy some local bubblegums and other stuff From four standing near to each other cooperative kiosks the only one seller didn't want to talk to us. In her own will. She just pointedly turned away with very dissatisfied physiognomy. But we've had no problems with others, including the currency payments. Here begins the ordinary village. Basically, comparing to Russia, nothing really terrible. But Europeans really have got nothing to do here The population is friendly (the worst thing we've seen - the man just passed us by, pretending that does not notice us). Nobody importunes, nobody asks for money. Just the kids at the embankment near the hotel tried to talk to us (they knew the only word - "OK" : ) They were completely satisfied with a candy. As I noticed before, houses are fenced by continuous fences, for neighbors and passers-by couldn't see what's going on inside. Actually, there's nothing special inside. Alexey here continued to hunt for bubblegums. The local population did not object (here and there on the ground the pieces of a fabric with the fine goods laid. Nobody protested to take dollars. But sometimes sellers ran away to ask neighbors. Also nobody haggled with us - we just changed bubblegums to 1 dollar banknotes in more or less reasonable parity Somewhere there're more decent houses. Also the lots somewhere organized as in Russia - without continuous fences. But it's not characteristic. The nature and landscapes - right here - looks like Leningrad region Couple of ravines, pines, sand. The road is ordinary too. Only, if to look narrowly, unknown plants come across, and those that are known, look slightly not so. Here our small walk finished. We have returned to hotel, fairly having informed girls about our vile act It has not made a special impression on them. I think, at the moment in the places, where it's needed :, the general representation about us was already made. They realized that we're not seeking the pictures with rubbish heaps and ruins. So, they just winked at this. The coast, the beach and us. This is the Japan sea. But Koreans (including southern) call it "Eastern Sea of Korea". About their relations with Japan I already wrote earlier. It's still too cold to swim. But we've walked barefoot at the water. Need to say that any visible restrictions on an output to coast are not observed (I read in one article before the trip, that a barbed wire is everywhere The other thing, that there're almost no boats at the horizon. Maybe, it's not allowed to swim out by boats and fisherman-ships? As I written before, some roads in Korea (main roads and also avenues in the capital) have a huge width. The one more thing is - that here, just like in Russia, it's allowed to stand at the roadside, to sell mushrooms and berries. Although officially it's forbidden. But, anyway Actually, not a capital bus. The back wheels seems to be taken from a lorry This is not the rice, it's the evaporation of salt process. It's not seen very well, but you can believe me, that there're lots of TV aerials on the roofs of the buildings. I think, that in old buildings the collective TV aerials were not foreseed, so the inhabitants had to solve this problem by theirselves. Talking about TV broadcasting, it's needed to say that usually only 1-2 channels are available. The repertoire is modest: local films, Chinese or soviet movies. The news are regular. It's curious, that there're no video subjects in the news. Usually the announcer reads something or the static photos are shown. People carries different things, useful in household. I've seen in Pyongyang the man, who carried a refrigerator (!) on the bike! Vertically! It has really impressed me! The general dam view. Makes a strong impression! The temple was originally raised in 1042 and since then it's been burnt and re-built many times. The quote from one of the sources about Buddha: "According to Buddhist chronology the Buddha lived with 623 on 544 ã up to B.C. He was born in aristocratic family that ruled a small country on the border of Nepal and India. In his childhood he was protected . from the unpleasant parties of a surrounding life. When Gautama grown up, he realized that life is full of sorrow. He decided to help the people. At the age of 29 he left home and became a hermit. But soon he knew that killing of the flesh conducts to fading of the mind and gave up the asketism. At the age of 35 he realized that the truth is near. Gautama absorbed into meditation and spent there 4 or 7 weeks without food and sleep. As a result he has reached an enlightenment, i.e. became the Buddha, who knows all the laws of Universe. After that Buddha walked around the country about 45 years, preaching his doctrine. He died at the age of 80" It's necessary to take off the shoes near the entrance. There're straw mats on the floor. s I said before, during the war, the bombing of USA has destroyed most of historical buildings in the North. That's why it's very difficult to tell, what building is ancient, what is restored and re-built. I think, there're lots of new-built. Anyway, they never say to tourists that "this building was re-built in some year" - for clear reasons. A group of children that we met, when we walked out of another sightseeing. Of course, they didn't miss a chanse to pose at the camera The duty monk in one of a monastries. To all attributes, the monk is his post. He walks out to tourists and answer the questions. Like: " Whether themonks serve in army?" (" -Yes, they do") and so on. Actually, the politically grounded monk. We asked, where do they take the food. The monk explained, that the state supplied'em with the food and they just grow different medicinal herbs. Have a look at the boots We drove from Keson to Pkhanmunjom village - about 8 km from Keson. At the 300 m to the border (to demilitarized zone about 2 km wide) we were invited to rest in a small house. The frontier guard came to talk to us (with the help of translator).We had a small talk about politics. Basically, he asked the questions. Like these: I heard about president elections in Russia and that V.Putin is elected. Has he got the real people's support? What is, to your mind, the most serious obstacle on the way to unite the Korea? Because we two answered in different ways, we asked the girls to translate the answer that they liked most Then we wished the luck to each other and went back to the bus. The previous driver left us. The "comrade colonel" sat behind the wheel again and also two soldiers with machine guns and the frontier guard went with us. Five pics below you can see this frontier as a guide. We've driven on the narrow road, surrounded with barbed wire. And soon we appeared on the spacious square with the view of Southern Korea. with megaphone in his hands came before them and started to tell the south-korean version of events during the war. We heard almost every word. Well now I understand why we came here : Our proleader seemed to read our minds and has grinned silently, as if he wanted to say: " You see everything, I've nothing to add Later I've read in some western story about visit to Northern Korea these lines: " Down by the demarcation line, North Korean soldiers stood stiffly in dress uniform on one side, stared at by slouching South Korean troops in mirrored sunglasses on the other. From afar they looked like Russians and Americans... Looks like it's not our impression only. By the way, the American forces are still quartered in Southern Korea.

He recently went on a trip to DPRK. I'll translate his comments briefly. On your arrival at the airport you need to leave your cellphone, no roaming service is avaliable but if you select an operator manually you get PRK 03 although he never saw a single person with a cell-phone. Laptops are allowed it seems that north koreans are not aware of cards that can make your laptop to work like a cellphone. The only house where a foreigner will be ever allowed on his visit. It's a model-house of a model-farmworker of a model-collective farm. There is even something that looks like a computer made of components that are not even plugged together. Internet does not exist, only intranet is avalaible. On your arrival you will be assigned to a guide and a driver. That will constantly follow you. You can't leave the hotel on your own. The daily program consists of 2-3 visits to a landmark. In the hotel you can watch BBC,NTV (russian chan),and a couple of chinese channels, so you can't really complain about freedom of speech. The food is good, and you can't complain about that either. In a park he saw elder women picking up herbs, the guide said that it was for the rabbits, although it was clear that it was the kind of herb that the "owners of the rabbits" could eat. Kiosk that sells foreign product to tourists, as in snickers chinese sprite and lays from 2001. You have to chose your product pay at a sepate booth get a checkstub and give it to the merchant to get your purchase. Kiosk for locals, most of the time they sell lemonade, forigers are given a plastic cup, locals get porcelain mugs, that are washed in a bucket of water after use. Sometimes you see people selling some kind of a vegetable, that was taken next to a fruits and veggies store, they immediatly closed the door as they saw a tourist. North Koreans are always amazed when they see a white man. The plaster statues are clean and not broken apart. North Korea is a perfect reproduction of the year 1950. They still havent figured out how to make flat glass withtout bubbles, the only exception are the windows in the hotel or large vitrines. Oil is almost inexistant, so most of the labor is manual. Water seems not to be avaliable everywhere when you leave the capital. A woman is washing her clothes in the river. Life in a village When building in a city they tend to block the old houses with tall bulidings , if that is not possible they put a concrete fence so you would only see the roof. As soon as you try to take a picture different from the magazine "Korea" the guide will say: "why are you taking a picture" "it's forbidden here" Koreans are not shy when it comes to basic needs, the guide forbid to take pictures of men taking a piss on the middle of the road, but there was no problem when it happened in the capital next to to a monument (look at the guy on the steps) The big monument, (they cut off the electricity at 11) The city at night is scary, there is no light on the streets and people use white lights and no curtains. during the day the elevator didn't work for 15 mins View from the monument, besides the pretty view you can also see the dead birds. Reality of the NK, a forigner will not see this generally. The whole Pyongyang is like this, when he asked the guide about the old houses the guide said that old people didn't want to move out in the new ones and like it that way Send a private message to koutch Find More Posts by koutch
http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/10/27/are-chinese-restaurants-in-israel-any-good/	Are Chinese restaurants in Israel any good? | fiLi&#8217;s world The Jerusalem Globalist - The Israeli student perspective on China Friday, October 27th, 2006...10:49 am Are Chinese restaurants in Israel any good? there&rsquo;s now a good Israeli restaurant running in Taipei-Taiwan , I am still on the hunt for a decent Chinese restaurant in Israel. There are quite a few restaurants who advertise with the title of &ldquo;A Chinese restaurant&rdquo;, but having been to some of them I find most of them lacking in most respects. It&rsquo;s true that some of them are actually quite classy serving delicious food, but still &ndash; it&rsquo;s not Chinese food but rather a watered down version of what appears to be a variation of Thai food. The number one problem, I believe, is that most of the Chinese restaurants here in Jerusalem are Kosher &ndash; meaning that they have to comply with the Jewish law regulations for what may or may not happen when making food. Just as a short example, Kosher food doesn&rsquo;t allow mixing diary and meat based products in any way, and certain substances like pig and a big selection of fish and meat body parts can not be consumed. I find it ironic that most of the Chinese restaurants in Jerusalem are Kosher, as it&rsquo;s a bit like trying to make an omelet without any eggs. Some of the restaurants don&rsquo;t even try to look authentic and - just as an example - you won&rsquo;t be able to get chop-sticks even if you ask for them. A year-old article from English YNet covers the problem with a funny quote from the Chinese ambassador in Israel that gives a hard blow to the &ldquo;Israeli face&rdquo; - titled &ldquo; Official: Israeli Chinese food awful &rdquo; (I highly recommend looking at the talkbacks comments on the article): The standards of Chinese restaurants in Israel are "disgusting ," Xuan Chan, a senior official in China&rsquo;s embassy in Tel Aviv said during a Tourism Ministry symposium on the subject of Chinese tourism to Israel. "Many new and better places will have to open if you want the tourists from China to visit here,&rdquo; she said. I think I understand where she&#8217;s coming from&#8230; Here&rsquo;s a short list of the Chinese restaurants that I&rsquo;m aware of in Jerusalem and I&rsquo;d be happy to hear about others, if there are any : &ndash; &ldquo;Chinese, Japanese, Thai&rdquo;. Kosher. &ndash; &ldquo;Chinese, with a Japanese, Thai, Korean and a Philippian flavor&rdquo;. Kosher. It&rsquo;s also worth mentioning , which is &ndash; obviously &ndash; Korean. A Chinese dinner in Jerusalem A Taiwanese Blog on Israel What People Do -4- : Use your Chinese The Chinese perspective in Israel Yoja isn&#8217;t Chinese. Not all Asian food is Chinese food and besides Mandarin and Korosin (which I haven&#8217;t been to yet) the other restaurants don&#8217;t claim to be Chinese food. Try Yossi Peking on Keren Kayemet (and a few other locations). Reply to this comment Hmmm&#8230; well, if you click on the links I provided linking to the restaurants&#8217; websites you&#8217;ll see that I just quote how they describe themselves. They claim to be Chinese, that&#8217;s for sure. Yossi Peking, which is a block from my parents house, is not really a restaurant (in my humble opinion). It&#8217;s more like &#8220;Thai fast food&#8221;&#8230; and it doesn&#8217;t remotely resemble anything Chinese. If we include those kinds of places, then we have a few in city center (like Tirat Zvi) and Emek Refaim (like the one across from Yoja, I forgot the name). I would hate to think what would happen if Chinese people were to go there and taste their &#8220;Chinese&#8221; food&#8230; Reply to this comment The Oriental in Bet Shemesh is run by a couple from Hong Kong with a Mandarin chef, and they try to make it as authentic as possible, albeit within kosher laws. Check out details and story at Reply to this comment Talking about food in Israel and listing places in Jerusalem is like talking about Tourism in China and listing spots in Shenzen&#8230; all the good food is in Tel Aviv. Reply to this comment Heh&#8230; would you share a little about the Asian restaurants in TelAviv then? would you share your own experiences? All I know in TelAviv is &#8220;Dimsum&#8221;, Aharoni&#8217;s posh cuisine and one at southern TelAviv which are okay. You help me list them, I&#8217;ll try and go check those out. (Mind you that the story in Ynet is about Telaviv mostly. Most of the Chinese workers as well as the embassy are over there&#8230;) Reply to this comment &#8216;The Chinese Wall&#8217; in Tel Aviv, belongs to a Chinese family, used to be a very good restaurant. Haven&#8217;t been there for a VERY long time so I don&#8217;t know how it is nowadays. Reply to this comment Click here to cancel "reply".

http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/06/10/train-men/	Train man | fiLi&#8217;s world TAU Far-east conference : day 1 Saturday, June 10th, 2006...11:44 pm I&#8217;ve been seeing so many Asian movies lately, and I almost forgot about this one. It took me a while to , but I finally did and it&#8217;s&#8230; overwhelming. With other movies I might go into a deep investigation of the Japanese culture, think out loud about the nerd/geek phenomena (which, in a way, I&rsquo;m part of), go into the psychological aspects of social phobia and the fears of growing up and finding true love. But that would not do it justice since is about alot more than that. I laughed, I sympathized, I was worried, I was excited, and hmm&hellip; yeah&hellip; I even shed some tears. There&rsquo;s no escaping it - Train Man is me, Train man is us. Even if we&rsquo;re the super confident multi extrovert &ldquo;pick-up clubber&rdquo; kind&rsquo;o type, I honestly believe that we&rsquo;re all like that inside. Somewhat scared of the world, unconfident in our actions and of what we&rsquo;ve never known before yet we&rsquo;re even more afraid of missing out on something that big and ending up alone. It&rsquo;s so rare to have such opportunities in our lives that we experience something so basic and so pure, someone so powerful that it changes our whole lives and changes who we are completely - not on the outside, but in the way that we feel everything and the way we live through this world. There is hope for us still, something or someone is out there for us, and we live for that special moment that it arrives. The Korean Center in Jerusalem A new day, a new adventure&#8230; The Korean Center in Jerusalem &raquo; fiLi&#8217;s world [&#8230;] We walked over there and met Irena, a Russian-Korean girl, who decided to liven up the center by inviting more people and holding more acitivies. There&#8217;s even a website being built. The movie was cute (/kitsch) and romantic, very much Korean style from the Korean pop-movies I&#8217;ve seen so far, and it reminded me of the Japanese Train Men alot. Later on I heard that the center is holding a Korean language exchange every Thursday, and that plans are to have some more food and origami meetings in the near future.

A composition showing the heroism of the workers, its a rather unique piece since the military is on the 2nd plan. Banners with Kim Il Song , who calls up people for heroic acts. For some reason commarade Kim is young. You can often see pictures of Kim Jon Suk (wife of Kim Il Song) Like his composition is called "Comarade Kim Jon Suk is saving Kim Il Song), but Kim Il Song is shown even more often Bronze is often used in the monument, here you can see the worker, the farmworker and the intellectual. One of the 2 compositions next to Kim Il Song monument. In every place you will have a Pole with a citation of the great leader. Fancy garbage cans in parks. NK like to customize their number ,as you can see with the 40 Every citizen has a pin of Kim Il Song, except for little children, waiters (the pin is probably hidden by work clothes), and Kim Il Song himself You cannot by this pin. This means, shoe repairs upstairs. That means that a food joint is near, by the way even in China they draw a fork. You can see this on the doors, the X means entrance forbidden, and the thingy taht looks like a target means enter here. In a model pioneer palace, a concert is shown, at the end a picture of Kim Jong Il is shown, the forigners are in extasy. Next up we have roads and transporation.

Entrances to the subways look somewhat shabby. Inside you have the tourniquets that arrive you to the knee, contrary to chinese Koreans are of short stature. The sign reads: Kim Jong IL - the Sun of 21st century! The escalator is very long, and the lighting is original. Trains are made of 4 wagons, the doors are opened by hand and closed automatically. It seems that the goal of the NK architects was to make stations more impressive that Moscow's metro. The particularity of the cities is the lack of cars. Everyone is walking, sometimes they take packed public transportatins made of tramways, trolleys and even 2 storie buses. The bicycles are rare and expensive. The pedestrian zebra is original. In Pyongyang there is a lot of underground passages for crossing the street, everyone respects the rules, if you cross the street where you're not supposed to you get a fine, even if the road usually looks like this. Traffic signs warn you of other traffic signs. The drivers never stop in front of pedestrians, they constantly honk. The guide coulnt not explain the lack of reflex of the pedetrians when they hear a car. In the countryside people walk wherever they want, like there is no cars at all. The drivers on the other hand never chek their mirrors or look back. For some reason the gas stations are covered up and passangers must exit the car before the driver goes to the gas station. Line at the bus stop, people who take the bus are those who have to walk more than 30 mins toget home You can't move freely in NK, you need authorisations, and you have check-points everywhere. When the car crossed teh check point, the driver flashed the lights, perhaps its a meaning that a forigner is on board. Traffic lights exist but they dont work. How cars in NK look like. The sign is not lying A common sight, broken down gas-fueled truck, they drive slow and make a lot of smoke. You're not supposed to take that picture. Sometimes you see japanese or german cars. Koreans love Mercedes Benz, which they only know as Benz. Benz - is the favorite car of NK leaders. In Kim Il song mausoleum , his SEL 500 is parked forever on some porcelain supports. Maybe the love for benz will explain the following pictures Send a private message to koutch Find More Posts by koutch
http://www.filination.com/blog/2006/06/27/koreans-in-israel/	Koreans in Israel | fiLi&#8217;s world Israel&#8217;s cost of living China : Challenges and Implications -1- Tuesday, June 27th, 2006...11:29 pm Walking around the Hebrew University today, I picked up a copy of the student newspaper called Pi-Haaton (verbal meaning the female donkey&#8217;s mouth, or something) and was surprised to see an article with a word game titled &#8220;Korea Heart&#8221; (which is suppose to sound like heartbreaking). Not only isn&#8217;t it my own imagination that prices went up, it is now official that I haven&#8217;t gone insane seeing Asians all over the university. Yep, according to the article the Hebrew University hosts a live community of 100-200 Christian Koreans studying the holy scriptures. Assuming that there are a few dozens more from Japan and China and some more at the other campuses, that might explain why I see so many of them, especially around the library. I won&#8217;t go into translating the whole article, but here are some highlights : &#8220;The Mount-Scopus campus there&#8217;s a community of 100-200 Korean students (estimated by the Korean community). They form one of the largest foreign students communities&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Across from me sits a cross-eye person from a far away country I know little of and he talks in fluent Hebrew with almost-Israeli gestures&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;The Korean students main study the Bible, archeology, Hebrew and History. The fund their studies through a scholarship from the church or the support of their parents&#8230;&#8221; &#8220;Lee says : &#8220;There&#8217;s a problem in Christian religion in Korea which has to do with the fact that it&#8217;s an imported religion. To make it more authentic, people want to come to Israel&#8230; Eventually, Jesus wasn&#8217;t Christian, but Jewish, his language and culture were Hebrew, therefore - knowing the Jews and Hebrew has great value&#8221;.&#8221; Here&#8217;s a scan of the article The Korean Center in Jerusalem Little Asia - Israel Asians studying Hebrew &raquo; fiLi&#8217;s world [&#8230;] While in Israel I&#39;ve had some interesting encounters with other Asian nationalities who have come to Israel to study more about Judaism. One "Messianic Judaism" Korean girl I met by coincidence in Jerusalem&#39;s downtown was fascinated with the Jewish people and have been staying in Israel for ages, speaking Israeli level Hebrew with no accent. There were also reports on a growing Christian Korean community in Jerusalem. [&#8230;] Reply to this comment The Korean Center in Jerusalem &raquo; fiLi&#8217;s world [&#8230;] Korea is still a big mystery to me. I don&#8217;t really know much about Korea, but I came across Korean influences in almost all the Asian countries that I&#8217;ve been to, and they were always in a positive context. Korean culture - Korean movies, Korean fashion and Korean food are regarded of very high quality and of good style in both Taiwan, Vietnam and Singapore. The only Korean influences I&#8217;ve noticed in Israel so far were the growing Korean community at the Hebrew University, a Korean restaurant in Jerusalem and a Korean girl that I met downtown. It weird that almost nobody in the East Asian Department takes the Korean courses and Korea wasn&#8217;t represented in the East-Asia day we had last year. I guess China and Japan are more trendy.

I am delighted to invite you all to visit and take part in a new community website dedicated to Taiwan called &#8220; Taiwanderful - the Taiwan guide Most people who know me are well acquainted with my bizarre passion for everything remotely related to Taiwan. My time in Taiwan has been one of the best experiences of my life, and thatâs something I often try to share with others. A while ago, when I was in Brisbane-Australia&#8217;s public library looking for a potential East-Asia destination there was little to no information about Taiwan. It was by complete accident that I came across Taiwan, which I knew very little about at the time, mentioned in an old guidebook as the Republic of China. I searched through the library and found the Taiwan&#8217;s Lonely Planet mentioning how warm and friendly Taiwanese people are, but the way Lonely Planet was organized and written confused me allot. It was only by the help of two online guides written by Taiwanese bloggers - - that I decided on visiting Taiwan, and when I decided to stay for long those same guides helped me find a good Mandarin school and get settled in Taiwan. I am extremely grateful for them both. Working together with David, and based on his guide, I built &#8220; Taiwanderful - the Taiwan guide &#8221; as a community that would try and promote quality information about Taiwan. Things you can do on Taiwanderful - the Taiwan guide Browse and contribute to existing Taiwan guides . David&#8217;s guide to Taiwan has been imported to Taiwanderful and further expanded by David. If you want - start a new Taiwan related guide. Browse and contribute the Taiwan link-directory Get updates for Taiwan events or add new Taiwan events on the Taiwanderful event calendar Write your own Taiwanderful blog about Taiwan Read and take part in the Taiwanderful forums Browse latest news , forums and blogs about Taiwan The community is what&#8217;s important and we would like to see more people join and contribute their experiences and information regarding Taiwan. Taiwanderful is offering , so that those who contribute to the growth of the knowledge-base or the community will be rewarded for their efforts. So, come have a look, and I would love to see you join in and take part in the community. If you&#8217;d like to help promote this project, I&#8217;d be grateful if you&#8217;d help spread the word about Taiwanderful - the Taiwan guide by linking or by writing a review, and I do encourage you to register and use the The foreign perspective on Taiwan&#8217;s Betelnut girls Promoting Taiwan and Taiwan&#8217;s WHO bid A view of Taiwan The Gilad-hiker guide ot the Thai-laxy (part 1) Click here to cancel "reply".

http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?p=1693089#post1693089	North Korea - Military Photos Strictly Photos & Video Page 1 of 13 Join Date: Mar 2005 Location: In the land of the offenders A trip to North Korea The autor is Artemii Lebedev, one of the leading web-designers in Russia. He recently went on a trip to DPRK. I'll translate his comments briefly. On your arrival at the airport you need to leave your cellphone, no roaming service is avaliable but if you select an operator manually you get PRK 03 although he never saw a single person with a cell-phone. Laptops are allowed it seems that north koreans are not aware of cards that can make your laptop to work like a cellphone. The only house where a foreigner will be ever allowed on his visit. It's a model-house of a model-farmworker of a model-collective farm. There is even something that looks like a computer made of components that are not even plugged together. Internet does not exist, only intranet is avalaible. On your arrival you will be assigned to a guide and a driver. That will constantly follow you. You can't leave the hotel on your own. The daily program consists of 2-3 visits to a landmark. In the hotel you can watch BBC,NTV (russian chan),and a couple of chinese channels, so you can't really complain about freedom of speech. The food is good, and you can't complain about that either. In a park he saw elder women picking up herbs, the guide said that it was for the rabbits, although it was clear that it was the kind of herb that the "owners of the rabbits" could eat. Kiosk that sells foreign product to tourists, as in snickers chinese sprite and lays from 2001. You have to chose your product pay at a sepate booth get a checkstub and give it to the merchant to get your purchase. Kiosk for locals, most of the time they sell lemonade, forigers are given a plastic cup, locals get porcelain mugs, that are washed in a bucket of water after use. Sometimes you see people selling some kind of a vegetable, that was taken next to a fruits and veggies store, they immediatly closed the door as they saw a tourist. North Koreans are always amazed when they see a white man. The plaster statues are clean and not broken apart. North Korea is a perfect reproduction of the year 1950. They still havent figured out how to make flat glass withtout bubbles, the only exception are the windows in the hotel or large vitrines. Oil is almost inexistant, so most of the labor is manual. Water seems not to be avaliable everywhere when you leave the capital. A woman is washing her clothes in the river. Life in a village When building in a city they tend to block the old houses with tall bulidings , if that is not possible they put a concrete fence so you would only see the roof. As soon as you try to take a picture different from the magazine "Korea" the guide will say: "why are you taking a picture" "it's forbidden here" Koreans are not shy when it comes to basic needs, the guide forbid to take pictures of men taking a piss on the middle of the road, but there was no problem when it happened in the capital next to to a monument (look at the guy on the steps) The big monument, (they cut off the electricity at 11) The city at night is scary, there is no light on the streets and people use white lights and no curtains. during the day the elevator didn't work for 15 mins View from the monument, besides the pretty view you can also see the dead birds. Reality of the NK, a forigner will not see this generally. The whole Pyongyang is like this, when he asked the guide about the old houses the guide said that old people didn't want to move out in the new ones and like it that way Send a private message to koutch Find More Posts by koutch Join Date: Mar 2005 Location: In the land of the offenders You have to button up your shirt and look serious, and leave eveything except your sunglasses at the entrance, you will have to go trough an x-ray scanner (which no one tells you about), and for some reason there is a wi-fi router. The statue is white, and the light on top is blue and on the bottom is red. And its called a "visit" because the Great Leader is still "alive" Next to the statue wearing an ironic t-shirt ( Hysteria of the USSR), the guide didn't know russian well, and when was asked an unplesant question didn't know russian at all.

They do everything, taking care of the cattle, picking up wood, and ride 40 persons in a truck As a form of entertainement both Koreas will take you to a visit to the border. One mystery remains, how comme under capitalism the roads are good and under communism sh*tty. Sand is where NK is. The road is prepared for an invasion, the big cubes can be pushed on the road to trap the enemy tanks. Just in case they put those things up on every road in the radius of 50km from the border, they are often decorated. They also have those in the mountains. A NK beach, electrified barbed-wire so the NK citiziens wouln't swim away, of couse you're not allowed to take that picture. NK love to show off military trophees, like the american spy ship Pueblo. Pieces of US aicraft in a museum, that are gathered up with a lot of love. NK defends itself not only from imperialist agressors, every neiborhood is defended. Once by a coincidence, he took a picture of that buliding with AC on every window. Of couse he was told that he's not allowd to take the picture. Apperently this is not an ordinary house, maybe scientists live there.

A composition showing the heroism of the workers, its a rather unique piece since the military is on the 2nd plan. Banners with Kim Il Song , who calls up people for heroic acts. For some reason commarade Kim is young. You can often see pictures of Kim Jon Suk (wife of Kim Il Song) Like his composition is called "Comarade Kim Jon Suk is saving Kim Il Song), but Kim Il Song is shown even more often Bronze is often used in the monument, here you can see the worker, the farmworker and the intellectual. One of the 2 compositions next to Kim Il Song monument. In every place you will have a Pole with a citation of the great leader. Fancy garbage cans in parks. NK like to customize their number ,as you can see with the 40 Every citizen has a pin of Kim Il Song, except for little children, waiters (the pin is probably hidden by work clothes), and Kim Il Song himself You cannot by this pin. This means, shoe repairs upstairs. That means that a food joint is near, by the way even in China they draw a fork. You can see this on the doors, the X means entrance forbidden, and the thingy taht looks like a target means enter here. In a model pioneer palace, a concert is shown, at the end a picture of Kim Jong Il is shown, the forigners are in extasy. Next up we have roads and transporation.

(Comment on this title) 45 out of 70 people found the following comment useful:- Truly romantic film for the matured, bitter homage to Hong Kong , 2 November 2004 The movie was well above my expectation and definitely worth a wait. Tony Leung plays the same man with "In the Mood for Love" but has a different character. The movie is also vaguely related to "Days of Being Wild" in 1990, co-starred by Leslie Cheung and Maggie Cheng. All three films are about the mixture of hustle-bustle and weariness of Hong Kong in 1960s. Tony's performance in this film was again brilliant. Faye Wong performed in WKW film for the first time in 10 years (since "Chung King Express" in 1994, also co-starred by Tony Leung) and made this film one of a kind. Mysterious gambler Gong Li was also attractive. Zhang Ziyi gave me a positive surprise. The film's technical level (costumes, music, photography etc.) is also very high. Someone suggested 2004 Cannes Palm d'Or should have gone to this film instead of "Fahrenheit 9/11" and now I can totally agree. The number "2046" is the metaphor of Hong Kong's destiny, which implies the last year of status-quo for 50 years guaranteed by Chinese government. Was the above comment useful to you?

Skip to next paragraph Stephane Danna/Agence France-Presse, for The New York Times Gro Harlem Brundtland is a United Nations special envoy for environmental issues. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Reaching out even to competitors like China, where coal-powered plants continue to rise, is crucial, she said. Twenty years ago, the former Norwegian prime minister and public health doctor directed a commission seeking ways to balance the human enterprise and the planets limits. The human population was then spiking toward five billion. Scientists were raising early concerns about a buildup of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. The Amazon was ablaze. The latest African famine had struck. The eco-disasters of Bhopal and Chernobyl still resonated. What became known as the Brundtland Commission concluded in a report titled   that a global goal should be to make social and economic development sustainable, meaning that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Today, the human population is more than 6.5 billion, and nearly half the people in the world live on less than $2 a day. Emissions are rising relentlessly in established and emerging economic powers, and economic expansion is still the prime goal around the world. And at 68, after a stint directing the , Dr. Brundtland is being asked to attack global environmental problems once more. United Nations Secretary General chose her as one of three special envoys with the job of prodding world leaders to act on at least one environmental front: cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Dr. Brundtlands focus will be getting countries to commit to new actions under the Kyoto Protocol, under which only a few dozen countries are required to make cuts in emissions, and the underlying 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, which committed nearly all the worlds countries to avoiding dangerous human interference with the climate system but did not mandate any steps. In a telephone interview from her home in Nice, France, Dr. Brundtland reflected on the need for leaders to shape national priorities for the future and for the sake of people on the other side of the globe. There seem to be many people who havent accepted that humans are influencing the environment on a planetary scale, particularly the climate. Does it surprise you that its taken such a long time for us to absorb the idea that weve gone global? At the time of our report in 1987, the messages we gave were very clear about the issue. And they were explained in relatively simple, readable terms. The message certainly spread to environmental groups, to the scientific and research community, to the universities and to the political environment in many countries. But then, when you go from that level to the average person, it probably is a different question. These are complicated issues. So it has taken a long time for public opinion to put pressure on politicians. Not in all countries. In Norway we had elections in 1989, and the environment was so high on the agenda that it really overshadowed most other issues. In 1990, my government instituted a carbon dioxide tax. I had all the oil-producing countries of the world lining up against me. I explained there is no other way to deal with than to do something about the price of carbon. You have to do things that hurt. It hurt certainly industry and the oil industry when this happened. Today, 20 years later, this has affected Norways continental shelf. It is the cleanest oil technology anywhere, because theyve had a tax and regulations that inspired or forced them to do the right thing. Now more and more political leaders understand that things need to be done, and we cannot accept politicians who are not taking this seriously. This sustainability concept as you laid it out 20 years ago goes against one of the foundations of established economic theory, which is that the future will always be richer and smarter than the present generation, so we shouldnt sacrifice today for their sake. For people in their 50s or 40s today, if you look back in history that has always been the case. Everything theyve learned or experienced has led in this direction, and they havent had to listen that there are some problems that are not integrated with that economic theory. Now, as more and more economists are aware, these environmental costs cannot be externalized, the environment has to be integrated and taken account of. Now economists are not taken seriously anymore if they disregard this new reality. So does protecting the global environment require a new economics in a way? You have to put it into the equation. That is what has been done in the new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ( ) Actions in the next two or three decades will determine if it is possible to get to no more than 2 or 2.4 degrees temperature increase (3.5 to 4.3 degrees Fahrenheit). They find it is possible, using existing technologies and developing technologies that are now realistic. And they find it is a very small cost involved. It is not as if what needs to happen is plainly impossible for economic or other reasons. The challenge is political  its whether political decision makers around the world can act quickly enough to make a difference. How much does the rich world owe countries that havent contributed to the greenhouse gas buildup so far?

State officials around the country are struggling to find the money to carry out initiatives to reduce emissions on school buses. And Congress has yet to deliver on the $1 billion over five years it promised in 2005 to help states clean up diesel fleets, including school buses. Breathing high concentrations of diesel emissions  known as particulates  can cause minor ailments like headaches, wheezing and dizziness. But studies have also found that the contaminants can do more serious damage. Recent studies by the and other groups link the emissions to asthma and lung cancer. Two types of filters are available to reduce the most dangerous emissions on older buses. Diesel particulate filters, which are installed in place of mufflers at about $700 each, can reduce tailpipe emissions by 85 percent. Closed crankcase filtration systems, which go under the hood and cost $7,500, can reduce engine soot by 90 percent. A bus can be fitted with one or both filters. An estimated 390,000 diesel school buses are on the road, according to the E.P.A. Most newer buses meet stricter emissions guidelines and do not need filters. But more than 100,000 diesel buses were manufactured before 1990 and are big polluters, according to the agency. Researchers say emissions enter through doors and windows on older buses. The longer the ride, the more harmful it is to children, they say. Clean bus advocates say California is the leader on the issue. Voters there approved a $200 million measure last year to clean up its school bus fleet. But in many other states, money to help schools retrofit buses has been nonexistent. In Texas, lawmakers created a grant program two years ago to help schools pay for the filters. But they never financed the effort. Congress passed the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act in 2005, a bipartisan initiative that authorized $1 billion to help states clean up diesel fleets. But states have seen none of that money. The Bush administration proposed modest financing for the initiative in its last two budgets, but Congress has not acted. Experts say children are particularly vulnerable because soot particles can disrupt development of their respiratory systems. Also, children breathe more quickly than adults and take in more air per pound. Not everyone is convinced that the air in school buses is a threat. State Representative Warren Chisum of Texas, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, said it did not make sense to spend huge sums on a cleanup because the science is not very good. More Articles in National &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/nyregion/11plant.html	State Closes Coal-Fired Plant That Failed to Limit Emissions - New York Times State Closes Coal-Fired Plant That Failed to Limit Emissions Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 STONY POINT, N.Y., May 10 &#151; Four years ago, a company that owns two local power plants settled a lawsuit with by agreeing to install $100 million worth of pollution control technology at one of them, its coal-fired plant here, or shut it down. At the time, the company, Mirant New York, said it would move forward with the upgrades at its Lovett plant. But on Thursday, state officials announced a different outcome. In a news conference here, Attorney General said the state was forcing the plant to close after Mirant failed to reduce emissions with new technology. One unit of the plant closed on Monday, while the other will close in one year, as stipulated by a 2003 consent decree. The emissions from the 350-megawatt Lovett plant are linked to acid rain and smog. At the time of the settlement, state environmental officials said the emissions from Lovett alone, which looms over the west bank of the Hudson River, represented a quarter of the sulfur dioxide and almost a third of the nitrogen oxide released by electric generators in seven counties in the Hudson Valley. The state also announced on Thursday that it had won a concession from Mirant, the area&#8217;s largest taxpayer, that should assuage residents of this town as well as the neighboring town of Haverstraw, where the company has its Bowline plant, an oil-powered generating station. Area residents are reeling from a settlement last year with Mirant in which Rockland County and several taxing entities agreed to pay the company $275 million to make up for tax overcharges dating back more than a decade. The settlement has led to an increase in local taxes for several municipalities. To meet the terms of the settlement, the North Rockland school district, which is now on an austerity budget, recently issued a 30-year bond to raise $220 million for a tax refund. State officials, realizing that the closing of Lovett could result in new tax headaches for the area, won a commitment from Mirant not to challenge its tax assessment for the Bowline plant for the next two years. The company also pledged $1 million for energy conservation projects in northern Rockland County. &#8220;This is a win for the environment and also a win for the taxpayers,&#8221; Mr. Cuomo said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to reduce pollution, and with this agreement we&#8217;re also going to protect the taxpayers of Stony Point and Haverstraw.&#8221; A spokesman for Mirant New York, Louis F. Friscoe, said in a phone interview that the company had decided not to upgrade the Lovett plant. &#8220;Because of the vintage of the facility and the cost of the new technology, we just thought the economics weren&#8217;t there,&#8221; he said. But the Atlanta-based Mirant Corporation, which owns two dozen plants nationwide and recently emerged from bankruptcy, is exploring the possibility of building new natural-gas-fired plants on the sites of Lovett and Bowline, Mr. Friscoe said. Natural gas burns cleaner than coal or oil. In a statement, Mirant&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, Edward R. Muller, cited state estimates that the Hudson Valley would need increased electrical generation by 2011. He said that Mirant would &#8220;work with the state to insure that the new generation is built there to serve New York consumers.&#8221; More Articles in New York Region &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

The plant is in Athens, Ala. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10  The plans to reopen its Browns Ferry 1 nuclear reactor this month  22 years after it was shut for safety reasons and 5 years after extensive renovations began. The move reflects the increased interest in nuclear power as an energy source, but the government agencys willingness to spend $1.8 billion on the overhaul  almost as much as a new plant is supposed to cost  also shows just how hard companies think it will be to build a new plant. Nuclear energy promises to deliver large quantities of electricity without contributing to . But even though several utilities in the United States have talked about starting a new reactor  none have been ordered since the 1970s no company has yet done so. Browns Ferry 1, despite being out of use for more than two decades, enjoys the advantage of already having a license. David Lochbaum, a nuclear safety engineer at the Union of Concerned Scientists who once worked at Browns Ferry, said the decision to put so much into old technology was noteworthy. Most people, he said, are going to buy the new rather than an eight-track tape player. The decision to refurbish rather than start from scratch also saved time, with project completion anticipated in 60 months. The industry has tried hard to shorten the time needed to plan and build a new reactor, but still projects that it will be about 12 years. Compared with starting fresh, fixing up an old plant is a simpler task from a regulatory point of view, said James R. Curtiss, a former member of the and now a lawyer at Winston & Strawn, which specializes in the nuclear field. Youve got many of the key regulatory decisions behind you, he said. Using an old license avoids the need for what is likely to be a drawn-out and contentious public hearing. Browns Ferry 1 is one of the very few places where the industry can use an existing license to add capacity. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has made changes in its licensing procedure that it says will make the process faster and more predictable, but some utilities are nervous about being the first to try it out. Browns Ferry, in Athens, Ala., would be the first reactor to come into service in this decade. The last one was Watts Bar 1, also a T.V.A. plant, in Spring City, Tenn., in June 1996. Construction had been halted at Watts Bar 1 for years. The T.V.A. is now studying whether to finish Watts Bar 2, where most work stopped in 1988. At Browns Ferry 1, the authority says it has installed about 150 miles of cable and more than 6 miles of pipes, an unprecedented effort at a completed plant. At the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industrys trade association, Adrian Heymer, the senior director for new plant deployment, said that one reason for the extensive replacements was so the paper trail would be re-established, to assure that all the work was performed up to nuclear standards. Mr. Heymer said that the project at Browns Ferry was a kind of rehearsal for new plant construction, showing that the industry could still manage large projects. It may not be ready to go on the road: any effort to build a number of new reactors, Mr. Heymer said, could run up against a national shortage of welders and other craft workers. said it was ordering parts for a new reactor that it hoped would be built at North Anna, Va., adjacent to two reactors operated by Dominion. The reactor has not yet been ordered, however. of Baltimore ordered parts for a plant it hoped to build in Calvert County, Md., south of Washington, and adjacent to its Calvert Cliffs reactors. As for the Browns Ferry renovation, Craig Beasley, a T.V.A. spokesman, said that the exact cost would not be known for some months, but would probably not be much more than $1.8 billion. The reactors power level is also being increased, and will eventually be over 1,200 megawatts if all goes as planned. The standard measure for power plants is price per kilowatt, which is roughly the amount of generating capacity needed to run one window air-conditioner. It will come to about $1,500 at Browns Ferry. Two years ago, Westinghouse was saying that its AP-1000 reactor could be built from scratch for about $1,400 a kilowatt of capacity. (Since that time, though, prices for stainless steel, concrete and other ingredients have gone up.) The Nuclear Energy Institute predicted that after the first few were built, the cost would be about $1,200 a kilowatt, and that the first would cost closer to $1,400  not counting the expense of borrowing money to finance construction. T.V.A.s decision suggests that it believes the figures may be too low. The Browns Ferry project has a checkered history. The T.V.A. set out to build two reactors there in 1966, predicting operation by 1970 at a construction cost of $247 million, plus $66 million for the first load of fuel. Unit 1 opened in August 1974, and Unit 2 the following year, at a cost of more than $500 million, or about $2 billion in todays dollars. In March of the following year, an electrician was using a candle in a room full of cables, under the control room, to look for air leaks, a procedure that the authority described as normal. He set a fire that burned for hours and disabled the reactors emergency core cooling system. The fire is still regarded as the second most serious commercial nuclear accident, after the meltdown at Three Mile Island in March 1979. It set off a nationwide effort to make sure that safety equipment, all with backups at the ready, did not have cables running together through single cable trays and ducts. The reactor reopened, but 10 years later, in March 1985, the T.V.A. shut all three of the reactors on the site because of numerous safety problems. Unit 2 reopened in May 1991, and Unit 3 in November 1995. As the plant sat idle for 22 years, the clock was ticking on its 40-year operating license. But in May 2006, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a 20-year extension on all three Browns Ferry plants. The reactor now being restarted might go longer than the extra 20 years, said Julian J. Steyn, an industry consultant, because it has so little operating time. There is nothing to say they couldnt get another 20, he said. And with the prospect looming of taxes and other costs on the carbon dioxide and other pollutants produced by fossil fuels, Browns Ferry 1 could enjoy the advantage that it will not be subject to taxation for global warming and acid rain reasons as we go down the road. More Articles in Business &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

At the time, the company, Mirant New York, said it would move forward with the upgrades at its Lovett plant. But on Thursday, state officials announced a different outcome. In a news conference here, Attorney General said the state was forcing the plant to close after Mirant failed to reduce emissions with new technology. One unit of the plant closed on Monday, while the other will close in one year, as stipulated by a 2003 consent decree. The emissions from the 350-megawatt Lovett plant are linked to acid rain and smog. At the time of the settlement, state environmental officials said the emissions from Lovett alone, which looms over the west bank of the Hudson River, represented a quarter of the sulfur dioxide and almost a third of the nitrogen oxide released by electric generators in seven counties in the Hudson Valley. The state also announced on Thursday that it had won a concession from Mirant, the area&#8217;s largest taxpayer, that should assuage residents of this town as well as the neighboring town of Haverstraw, where the company has its Bowline plant, an oil-powered generating station. Area residents are reeling from a settlement last year with Mirant in which Rockland County and several taxing entities agreed to pay the company $275 million to make up for tax overcharges dating back more than a decade. The settlement has led to an increase in local taxes for several municipalities. To meet the terms of the settlement, the North Rockland school district, which is now on an austerity budget, recently issued a 30-year bond to raise $220 million for a tax refund. State officials, realizing that the closing of Lovett could result in new tax headaches for the area, won a commitment from Mirant not to challenge its tax assessment for the Bowline plant for the next two years. The company also pledged $1 million for energy conservation projects in northern Rockland County. &#8220;This is a win for the environment and also a win for the taxpayers,&#8221; Mr. Cuomo said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to reduce pollution, and with this agreement we&#8217;re also going to protect the taxpayers of Stony Point and Haverstraw.&#8221; A spokesman for Mirant New York, Louis F. Friscoe, said in a phone interview that the company had decided not to upgrade the Lovett plant. &#8220;Because of the vintage of the facility and the cost of the new technology, we just thought the economics weren&#8217;t there,&#8221; he said. But the Atlanta-based Mirant Corporation, which owns two dozen plants nationwide and recently emerged from bankruptcy, is exploring the possibility of building new natural-gas-fired plants on the sites of Lovett and Bowline, Mr. Friscoe said. Natural gas burns cleaner than coal or oil. In a statement, Mirant&#8217;s chairman and chief executive officer, Edward R. Muller, cited state estimates that the Hudson Valley would need increased electrical generation by 2011. He said that Mirant would &#8220;work with the state to insure that the new generation is built there to serve New York consumers.&#8221; More Articles in New York Region &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

At the Nuclear Energy Institute, the industrys trade association, Adrian Heymer, the senior director for new plant deployment, said that one reason for the extensive replacements was so the paper trail would be re-established, to assure that all the work was performed up to nuclear standards. Mr. Heymer said that the project at Browns Ferry was a kind of rehearsal for new plant construction, showing that the industry could still manage large projects. It may not be ready to go on the road: any effort to build a number of new reactors, Mr. Heymer said, could run up against a national shortage of welders and other craft workers. said it was ordering parts for a new reactor that it hoped would be built at North Anna, Va., adjacent to two reactors operated by Dominion. The reactor has not yet been ordered, however. of Baltimore ordered parts for a plant it hoped to build in Calvert County, Md., south of Washington, and adjacent to its Calvert Cliffs reactors. As for the Browns Ferry renovation, Craig Beasley, a T.V.A. spokesman, said that the exact cost would not be known for some months, but would probably not be much more than $1.8 billion. The reactors power level is also being increased, and will eventually be over 1,200 megawatts if all goes as planned. The standard measure for power plants is price per kilowatt, which is roughly the amount of generating capacity needed to run one window air-conditioner. It will come to about $1,500 at Browns Ferry. Two years ago, Westinghouse was saying that its AP-1000 reactor could be built from scratch for about $1,400 a kilowatt of capacity. (Since that time, though, prices for stainless steel, concrete and other ingredients have gone up.) The Nuclear Energy Institute predicted that after the first few were built, the cost would be about $1,200 a kilowatt, and that the first would cost closer to $1,400  not counting the expense of borrowing money to finance construction. T.V.A.s decision suggests that it believes the figures may be too low. The Browns Ferry project has a checkered history. The T.V.A. set out to build two reactors there in 1966, predicting operation by 1970 at a construction cost of $247 million, plus $66 million for the first load of fuel. Unit 1 opened in August 1974, and Unit 2 the following year, at a cost of more than $500 million, or about $2 billion in todays dollars. In March of the following year, an electrician was using a candle in a room full of cables, under the control room, to look for air leaks, a procedure that the authority described as normal. He set a fire that burned for hours and disabled the reactors emergency core cooling system. The fire is still regarded as the second most serious commercial nuclear accident, after the meltdown at Three Mile Island in March 1979. It set off a nationwide effort to make sure that safety equipment, all with backups at the ready, did not have cables running together through single cable trays and ducts. The reactor reopened, but 10 years later, in March 1985, the T.V.A. shut all three of the reactors on the site because of numerous safety problems. Unit 2 reopened in May 1991, and Unit 3 in November 1995. As the plant sat idle for 22 years, the clock was ticking on its 40-year operating license. But in May 2006, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission granted a 20-year extension on all three Browns Ferry plants. The reactor now being restarted might go longer than the extra 20 years, said Julian J. Steyn, an industry consultant, because it has so little operating time. There is nothing to say they couldnt get another 20, he said. And with the prospect looming of taxes and other costs on the carbon dioxide and other pollutants produced by fossil fuels, Browns Ferry 1 could enjoy the advantage that it will not be subject to taxation for global warming and acid rain reasons as we go down the road. More Articles in Business &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph Stephane Danna/Agence France-Presse, for The New York Times Gro Harlem Brundtland is a United Nations special envoy for environmental issues. Chang W. Lee/The New York Times Reaching out even to competitors like China, where coal-powered plants continue to rise, is crucial, she said. Twenty years ago, the former Norwegian prime minister and public health doctor directed a commission seeking ways to balance the human enterprise and the planets limits. The human population was then spiking toward five billion. Scientists were raising early concerns about a buildup of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. The Amazon was ablaze. The latest African famine had struck. The eco-disasters of Bhopal and Chernobyl still resonated. What became known as the Brundtland Commission concluded in a report titled   that a global goal should be to make social and economic development sustainable, meaning that it meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Today, the human population is more than 6.5 billion, and nearly half the people in the world live on less than $2 a day. Emissions are rising relentlessly in established and emerging economic powers, and economic expansion is still the prime goal around the world. And at 68, after a stint directing the , Dr. Brundtland is being asked to attack global environmental problems once more. United Nations Secretary General chose her as one of three special envoys with the job of prodding world leaders to act on at least one environmental front: cutting greenhouse gas emissions. Dr. Brundtlands focus will be getting countries to commit to new actions under the Kyoto Protocol, under which only a few dozen countries are required to make cuts in emissions, and the underlying 1992 Framework Convention on Climate Change, which committed nearly all the worlds countries to avoiding dangerous human interference with the climate system but did not mandate any steps. In a telephone interview from her home in Nice, France, Dr. Brundtland reflected on the need for leaders to shape national priorities for the future and for the sake of people on the other side of the globe. There seem to be many people who havent accepted that humans are influencing the environment on a planetary scale, particularly the climate. Does it surprise you that its taken such a long time for us to absorb the idea that weve gone global? At the time of our report in 1987, the messages we gave were very clear about the issue. And they were explained in relatively simple, readable terms. The message certainly spread to environmental groups, to the scientific and research community, to the universities and to the political environment in many countries. But then, when you go from that level to the average person, it probably is a different question. These are complicated issues. So it has taken a long time for public opinion to put pressure on politicians. Not in all countries. In Norway we had elections in 1989, and the environment was so high on the agenda that it really overshadowed most other issues. In 1990, my government instituted a carbon dioxide tax. I had all the oil-producing countries of the world lining up against me. I explained there is no other way to deal with than to do something about the price of carbon. You have to do things that hurt. It hurt certainly industry and the oil industry when this happened. Today, 20 years later, this has affected Norways continental shelf. It is the cleanest oil technology anywhere, because theyve had a tax and regulations that inspired or forced them to do the right thing. Now more and more political leaders understand that things need to be done, and we cannot accept politicians who are not taking this seriously. This sustainability concept as you laid it out 20 years ago goes against one of the foundations of established economic theory, which is that the future will always be richer and smarter than the present generation, so we shouldnt sacrifice today for their sake. For people in their 50s or 40s today, if you look back in history that has always been the case. Everything theyve learned or experienced has led in this direction, and they havent had to listen that there are some problems that are not integrated with that economic theory. Now, as more and more economists are aware, these environmental costs cannot be externalized, the environment has to be integrated and taken account of. Now economists are not taken seriously anymore if they disregard this new reality. So does protecting the global environment require a new economics in a way? You have to put it into the equation. That is what has been done in the new report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. ( ) Actions in the next two or three decades will determine if it is possible to get to no more than 2 or 2.4 degrees temperature increase (3.5 to 4.3 degrees Fahrenheit). They find it is possible, using existing technologies and developing technologies that are now realistic. And they find it is a very small cost involved. It is not as if what needs to happen is plainly impossible for economic or other reasons. The challenge is political  its whether political decision makers around the world can act quickly enough to make a difference. How much does the rich world owe countries that havent contributed to the greenhouse gas buildup so far?

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 8, 2007  On the Nez Perce reservation here, land that was cleared in the 19th century for farming is being converted back to forest, in part to sell the trees ability to sequester carbon. Skip to next paragraph Global Coolness: Carbon-Neutral Is Hip, but Is It Green? Anne Sherwood for The New York Times The tribe planted ponderosa pines, top, and pine, Douglas fir and larch saplings among old-growth stands on their own land. These forests are a carbon crop, Brian Kummett, a forester for the Nez Perce tribal forestry division, said as he surveyed a vast field studded with recently planted ponderosa pine, Douglas fir and larch saplings. We can sell the rights from the time the forest is planted to the time its harvested, 80 or 120 years down the road. The market for carbon credits promises to be a boon for some land-rich but cash-poor tribes. Selling carbon sequestration credits early in the growth of a forest lets the tribe realize some money more quickly, rather than waiting for decades for the harvest. Carbon is a constituent of heat-trapping gases like carbon dioxide. Trees can pull carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store the carbon in their tissue. Companies may be able to offset the carbon dioxide they send into the atmosphere by paying for projects that pull carbon out of the atmosphere. The Nez Perce are participating in an Indian tribe carbon portfolio being created by the National Carbon Offset Coalition in Butte, Mont., an organization supported largely by the Energy Department. They have a long-term management, large acreage and trained staff, said Ted Dodge, executive director of the coalition. Bob Gruenig, senior policy analyst for the National Tribal Environmental Council in Albuquerque, said the tribes see as a really big issue. They are seeing changes in the land, changes in plants and changes in the migration of wildlife, he said. New forests are just part of the carbon credits that are being sold on reservations and at other places. In the last few weeks, the Chicago Carbon Exchange has approved selling carbon sequestration credits on rangeland and no-till agricultural fields. An acre of pine forest captures and holds one to two metric tons of carbon dioxide per year, which it uses for photosynthesis. Untilled cropland holds a third of a ton of carbon per acre, and rangeland holds up to a fifth of a ton. The sequestered carbon dioxide is measured by soil tests before and after the planting. The market for carbon sequestration in the United States is voluntary. As a result, the demand has been low compared with Europe, where emissions are now restricted by law. The market also lacks uniform standards, prompting some environmental campaigners to question its credibility. Tribal carbon sales have had mixed results since the first such sale in the 1990s, when the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation in Washington sold rights to its land for 25 cents a metric ton. The Nez Perce had a major deal fall through a few years ago. It would have paid the tribe $1.50 a ton for 200,000 tons over 50 years and would have been worth nearly $500,000. Experts estimate that a project of that size would offset carbon equivalent to a years emission from 500,000 cars. Other tribes have found reason to grow carbon crops. In Washington and Oregon, new coal-fired power plants are required to offset their emissions. So the Lummi in northwestern Washington bought 1,700 acres that had been logged, reforested the land and sold sequestration rights to a power company. Officials say studies showing that recent warming is almost certainly caused by accumulating greenhouse gases are increasing support for cap and trade rules that limit the carbon dioxide a site can emit. If a factory produces less than the cap, it can sell the surplus rights to emit carbon to other companies. If a plant exceeds the limit, it has to buy the right to emit more gases from another company or find other methods to sequester carbon equal to what it is releasing. Carbon dioxide credits now sell for about $4 a metric ton. Mandatory restrictions, experts say, could increase the price to $12 or higher. In Europe, the cost of a credit sold for sequestering carbon dioxide has reached $20, and even $30, a ton. We need $12 to $15 carbon to really make this work, Mr. Dodge said. Were doing it on small margins. But to bring in a lot more landowners, you need better prices. Sphere: Related Blogs & Articles Next Article in Science (5 of 10) &#x00bb; Want to save this article?  Download the Times File Toolbar - get it now with TimesSelect.

http://rd.sportsblogs.org/viewEntry.php?id=645431&src=rss	Daily Norseman :: An Unofficial Minnesota Vikings Blog #23 With a Bullet! Wed, 9 May 2007 at 13:52:42 EDT Amazing. . .with a little more than to go before the first pre-season game, CBS Sportsline's Pete Prisco has released the most unbelievably premature set of Power Rankings for pointing these out.) He's got the Vikings ranked at #23, one spot below , which is mind-blowing in and of itself. But hey, at least we're trending upwards. . .we WERE at #26 in the previous rankings (whenever those came out). The funniest part? Not the fact that he has at #32, but the comments he has for the Browns. There is some young talent on the team, but they are still a long ways away from competing for a playoff spot. Throw Brady Quinn in there and chalk it up as a learning year The same Brady Quinn that Prisco criticized the Vikings for passing on in Round 1 because he (Quinn) was supposed to be some kind of freaking savior for Minnesota in 2007 is going to get a "learning year" in Cleveland? Loooooooooooooooove that media double standard. Oh, and according to this, Brady Quinn's "learning year," according to Prisco, is going to give the the #1 overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft. Don't think we won't hear about that ad nauseum. But anyway, we're better than the 23rd best team in the NFL. We're certainly better than third best in the NFC North. I think so, anyway. Forget Your Username or Password? #23 With a Bullet! :: 8 Comments :: I think we will finish up second in our division competing for a wild card spot, don't know about you guys but this guy sounds about as knowledgeable as a bag of bricks. Wed, 9 May 2007 at 17:12:23 EDT You think we'll finish second to the Bears I take it. Very likely but as long as it's not run, run, pass (short), punt we can put up some numbers. It should be obvious how we're gonna do early unless Childress learns how to adjust during games. If the ofense is handled like an NFL coach should we can chalenge the Bears for 1st! We played them well on the road last year for a little anyways. Fri, 11 May 2007 at 13:59:48 EDT Could take first place in our Divison,Bears always have a good Defensive year then fall apart the following.Pack has got Favre who believes all the hype about himself and will end up throwing 30 inters this year.Lions will be the Lions and will manage a sub 500 year.If T.J. can stay focused use his check downs and just throw the ball away when there isnt a play could be a good season.With hopefully a pair of shutdown corners, a step up on pass rush we can accomplish something. Wed, 9 May 2007 at 23:51:38 EDT We don't even have finalized rosters yet! This is about as silly as the whole "Draft Grading" a mere day after the selections are made. I guess, at this time of year, what else can they talk about. The regular season can't come soon enough... Thu, 10 May 2007 at 10:22:39 EDT I'm just thinking to myself, "Where did Mr. Prisco have the Saints rated last year at this time?" Every year teams rise and teams fall. My friends and I attempt to pick the winners on a weekly basis. For the first 5-6 weeks of the season it is common that the team one expects to win doesn't. Basically, until mid season it is impossible to accurately gauge anything. Thu, 10 May 2007 at 15:12:17 EDT The Vikings should be much higher than #23. Speed, with TJ he will have to use his check downs, but he can also run the ball, unlike Brad Johnson. So hopefully he won't have to throw any away. Also, after signing Howard Green and having Pat Williams in camp, I wonder if there will be any food left for the rest of the team. Thu, 10 May 2007 at 17:23:42 EDT Please, these guys have favorite teams too and obviously we ain't one of 'em. It's way too early to tell. You at least gotta wait until training camp breaks so you can see how rookiesw adjust to the next level, new players fit into and grasp the schemes, etc. Green Bay hasn't made any splashes, Detroit has Cal Johnson and may do a little better with the other additions, too. Chicago is still shaky at QB and now at RB. If we can generate a pass rush and put some les vanilla-like plays in then we'll be okay. We definitely need to start our CBs up in bump and run if we run the cover 2. Fri, 11 May 2007 at 13:51:54 EDT That this so called experts base everything on last years performance.Our offensive left side has had a full season together under their belt.Can remember a few pulls to the left side that was comical as they was tripping over each other.T.J. does have the wheels and has a pretty good arm.But being a rookie expect some passes to be lobbed into sidelines.If our run Def pick up where they left last year and our pass Def can pick it up 2 notches we could have a good season.The only reason Bears beat us the first game was fumble by Chester.I think we will have a good season.

I threw in a couple Vikings jokes, too (gotta stay fair and balanced)&#8230;these jokes are pretty hacky and old, but whatever. One Sunday afternoon a man is driving along when his car starts to sputter & cough. His car is pretty old and junky and he’s never had a brand new car before so he decides it’s time to get a new one. He pulls into a car dealership which happens to be open on Sunday. He tells the salesman he’s wants the newest, latest model available. The salesman says, “I got just what you want , You gotta take this one for a test drive…It’s got the most advanced radio system in the world.”… “All you have to do is say what you want to listen to and the radio tunes it in all by itself.” The guy can’t believe it so he decides to take the car for a test drive. He pulls out of the car lot and says, “Country Western” Zrperdblp…. The radio tunes into a country station. The guy is impressed. He says, “Rock & roll” Bzrtplret…The radio tunes into an awesome Rock station. The guy loves it. He’s driving along, smiling when all of a sudden several kids on bikes come flying off a side street and cross right in front of him! The guy slams on his brakes and yells, “Bunch of dumb idiots!” All of a sudden….BzZbrtlrgrt…the radio tunes into the Packer game. Q: What do you get when a groundhog comes out and sees a Green Bay Packer? A: Six more weeks of bad football. Q: Why don&#8217;t Vikings players jump into the stands? A: Because empty seats hurt. A guy walks into a bar with a dachshund under his arm. The dog is wearing a Minnesota Vikings jersey and helmet. The bartender says, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;ll have to leave. No pets allowed.&#8221; The guy begs him, &#8220;Look, I&#8217;m desperate. My TV&#8217;s busted and this is the only place we can watch the game.&#8221; After securing a promise that the dog will behave, and warning him that the dog and him will be thrown out if there is any trouble, the bartender lets him stay. The game starts and the Vikings receive the kick-off and march down the field, get stopped on the 30 and kick a field goal. Suddenly, the dog marches up and down the bar, giving high fives to everyone. The bartender says, &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s the most amazing thing I&#8217;ve ever seen. What does he do if they score a touchdown?&#8221; The dog owner replies, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;ve only had him for two years.&#8221; Anyways, I&#8217;ve talked about Peterson quite a bit, and have hardly mentioned the other draft picks. Next up, I think I&#8217;ll start talking about rounds 2-7&#8230;so come back soon, and let&#8217;s have a little more draft discussion.

Their faces are fresh and clean. What was once probably a Calvin Klein look is now sharpened into the crisp lines of their Armani uniforms. They buzz around taking notes in electronic organizers as million dollar numbers are tossed around in conversation. They guide prospective buyers to beautifully decorated and impeccably lit "living rooms" where the deal is being made. This is no car showroom, no modeling agency. This 20 Pine Street: The Collection. The man behind it is a 33 year-old real estate marketer named Michael Shvo. He uses high-end fashion to market luxury apartments. Shvo's most recent accomplishment is a building with the address 20 Pine Street. The presently gutted 1920s Chase Bank building will house luxury apartments ranging in price from $500,000 to $5 million, numbers Mr. Shvo says are certain to go up. The interior design company of Giorgio Armani - Armani Casa - is responsible for the look of the apartments. Furniture packages are also available from Armani for extra. When Martin Bashir asked Michael Shvo if the notion of using Armani here was because he liked Armani suits, Mr. Shvo quickly responded that he fits better into Brioni. The woman credited with the phenomenon of marketing apartments using brand name fashion designers is Louise Sunshine, creator of the well-known Sunshine real estate agency. In what was stunning news to industry insiders, Louise Sunshine arrived at 20 Pine Street, just steps from Ground Zero, and bought an apartment from her competition last week only two days after the sales center there opened. Michael Shvo has not always been so well-received by his colleagues, bosses and competitors. He stepped on toes as a young stockbroker newly arrived from Tel Aviv just ten years ago. But Michael Shvo weathered the storm, calling it all jealousy, and does seem to always come out clean, and living "Life on the Top", as one of his logos at 20 Pine Street boasts. Shvo squeezes in social time with his girlfriend, fashion designer Laura Poretzky whose line Abaeté will be featured this week in New York;s Fashion Week extravaganza. The couple dines at upscale restaurants and seems to possess and command a presence in a way ordinarily reserved for royalty. Whether you like Michael Shvo, or question the means to his meteoric climb to extreme wealth and extravagant lifestyle, he is undoubtedly among New York City's most successful and, for now, his star is no where near dimming. Martin Bashir explores this fascinating world of New York City high-end real estate through an inquisitive look at another day in the life on top of Michael Shvo. Nightline Producer Roxanna Sherwood is working with Martin Bashir on a profile of the real estate wunderkind Michael Shvo ... As part of Nightline's "BOOM NATION" series airing this week.

http://blogs.abcnews.com/thenightwriter/	Subscribe to this blog's feed February 28, 2006 5:00 PM Cynthia McFadden meets a teenage girl who must lose weight -- or she could die. I wasn't prepared to meet KieAra. I thought I was. I had read all the research. I had talked at length with producers Phil Maravilla and Deborah Apton. But when I first saw her walking down the hall toward me at the Texas Children's Hospital in Houston, I had to stop myself from gasping. KieAra Willis is 16 years old. She is 5'1 inches tall and she weighs over 350 pounds. KieAra's mother, Trina, was at the hospital with her daughter. And is so often the case, like her daughter she too is obese. We had come to Houston to try to understand the childhood obesity problem from another angle. We all know that American kids eat too much fast food and exercise too little and that they are heavier, on average, than they were a generation ago. But what we learned from the doctors at Texas Children's is that the obesity epidemic, (and they assure us it is that, an epidemic), is causing fat kids to exhibit adult diseases. Serious diseases that left unchecked will reduce the quality and length of their lives. The statistics in Houston alone are astounding. Long considered one of the nation's fattest cities, 30 percent of Houston's kids are over-weight ; 22% are obese . 25% of those kids either have or are on their way to developing Type 2 diabetes. That's 55,000 kids. 15% percent have fatty liver disease. That's 33,000 kids. Dr. William Klish the head of Obesity at Texas Children's says it is possible all of those kids could one day need a liver transplant. So, Houston clearly has a problem. And so does KieAra. Her father has type 2 diabetes. Two cousins have died of heart disease associated with obesity. She is a borderline diabetic, has chronic knee and back pain , and suffers nightly from sleep apnea, which causes her to stop breathing when she sleeps. Her doctors believe without loosing weight --- and lots of it --- soon, her life is in danger. So she has taken a bold and unusual step : KieAra has under-gone a gastric by-pass operation. The surgery is rarely given to teens as it is essentially irreversible and no one knows for certain the long term effects of the surgery on growing bodies. Her surgeon has cut her stomach in two and created a new stomach that is only the size of a walnut. Big enough to hold only a few mouthfuls of food. When I arrived in Houston last weekend, it was three weeks since KieAra's surgery. What was most startling is that although she has lost 35 pounds, she is hungry. Not hungry in her stomach, but hungry in her head for the comfort she has always been able to find in food. Food has been her best friend and the fact that her belly is not hungry does not stop her craving. She wonders if she did the right thing. Her story is a moving one. We'll have all of it tonight on Nightline. February 28, 2006 | Martin Bashir on his Trip to the Twin Cities February 22, 2006 2:57 PM As I wait at the airport gate, I recall with remarkable accuracy some words I memorized as a fourteen year old student of English literature back in London. Given the fact that I can barely remember my recently acquired Social Security number, this is no small achievement. I’m heading for the city of Minneapolis and these words come from Shakespeare’s Merchant of Venice: “The quality of mercy is not strain’d. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven Upon the place beneath. It is twice blest: It blesseth him that gives and him that takes”. It is Portia who speaks these famous words in the pivotal trial scene of the play. She’s disguised as a lawyer and seeks to assert her own understanding of ‘mercy’ into the proceedings. First, she makes the point that true mercy does not originate on earth but comes from God above; that the purest form of mercy can only fall from heaven. Second, she explains that mercy benefits the person who grants it as much as, if not more than, the person to whom it is extended. That paragraph was probably the conclusion of an essay I wrote way back in 1977… but what do Minneapolis and the Merchant of Venice have in common? The dispensation of justice and the quality of mercy hangs over both. We’re en route to meet Roland Armundson, who once sat as a Judge on the State’s second highest court – the Minnesota Court of Appeals. It’s one of the singular privileges of the working journalist – meeting individuals of some considerable note, whether good or ill. Amundson was a robust Judge, dispensing justice with surety and severity. A well-known local speaker, he prided himself on his own ethical standards, studied theology alongside the law (presumably to ensure the moral underpinnings of his Judgments) and served on a number of charitable boards… One board in particular. During the early 1990’s a close friend of Armundson’s asked him to take the position of Trustee at the head of a Fund that he had established to provide for his daughter. His daughter was mentally disabled and possessed the intellectual faculties of a three year old - as an adult. It was the act of a loving father toward his vulnerable daughter… and who better to maintain the probity of the Fund than an Appeal Court Judge? To learn of what befell the daughter, the Trust Fund, the Judge - and how Justice was dispensed - you’ll need to watch Nightline next week. But I can tell you… The tragedy is nothing less than Shakespearean in its scale and the quality of mercy remains a matter of bitter dispute. February 22, 2006 in Current Affairs | A Big Day on the Face Beat February 06, 2006 3:17 PM Martin Bashir has spent years on the face transplant story. Now he writes about how it's finally all coming together: Some stories seem to stick with you over long periods of time… and Facial Transplantation is one that I’ve been covering for years on both sides of the Atlantic. It back in 2001 that the Royal College of Surgeons held an important conference in London to discuss this breakthrough procedure. At the time, I was working for the UK’s biggest commercial television network, ITV, and our team was there in force. We held discussions with a range of experts who contributed to the debate: Dr John Barker, director of Plastic Surgery at the University of Louisville; Professor Peter Butler at the Royal College of Surgeons amongst others. When I joined ABC News in September 2004, this was the one story that I wanted to pursue. And by then another doctor had moved into pole position. I immediately organized meetings with Dr Maria Siemionow, at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. A renowned micro-surgeon, Dr Siemionow was methodically moving through the approval process at her hospital. All American hospitals have Independent Review Board’s (IRB’s) which must ratify any kind of experimental procedures. Dr Siemionow seemed the one surgeon most likely to conduct the first facial transplant. And then, towards the end of last year, there was the sudden announcement from France that a team had performed a partial face transplantation. I was involved in briefing one of our European producers who conducted an interview surgeon Dr Bernard Devauchelle who performed the operation. She may have lost the race to be first but we’re still working with Dr Siemionow as she selects a potential patient for her first procedure. We’ll keep you posted as the story develops on this side of the Atlantic.

http://www.cantstopwontstop.com/power.cfm	Can't Stop Won't Stop :: Power Images by Estria for Visual Element and "Hip-hop activism" is a term coined by the pioneering hip-hop intellectual and journalist Harry Allen. The term, he says, meant to show that hip-hop culture could both reflect a social critique and become a unifying force to enact change. The idea of hip-hop activism has since been embraced by young organizers, thinkers, cultural workers and activists to describe their generation's emerging work for social justice. It describes a broad range of social change practices, including youth organizing, cultural work, arts education, popular education, intercultural exchanges, youth development, and celebrity projects and events. Above all, hip-hop activism is a frame to understand the hip-hop generation's reaction to their world, and their desire to create alternative spaces for cultural development and progressive social change.
