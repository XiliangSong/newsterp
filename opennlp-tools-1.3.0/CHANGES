1.3.0

Summary
=======
This release improves the parser and coreference components, adds an
n-gram package to improve training memory requirements for the parser,
upgrades to the latest version of the maxent package, and adds preliminary
support for Spanish.  The upgrade to maxent-2.4.0 improves speed and
reduces memory requirements for most components.

Coreference
===========
Refactored some code, and improved gender detection with addition of a
name list.

Lang
====
Added lang package for language specific code.  Added Spanish componets
for sentence detection, tokenization, and pos-tagging.

N-Gram
======
New package to store n-grams and same them to a file.  This allows the
parser's build procedure to be training in a much smaller memory foot
print by allowing n-gram based features (which don't occur often enough)
to be pruned before they are generated as part of an event.

Parser
======
Updated to not attempt to attach punctuation in parses.  This improves
parsing performace.

Tagger
======
Updated to all n-gram dictionary to be used to distinguish between rare
and non-rare words.  This unfortunatly hurt performance so this option
is not the default.

Tokenizer
=========
Cleaned up mis-tokenized data with periods in the middle of sentences
split from preceeding token.

1.2.0

Summary
=======
This release adds a coreference resolution package. There are also some
other minor fixes.

General
=======
Updated some javadoc that was missing.
Fixed bug in beam seach data structure.

Sentence Detection
==================
Fixed bug involving the last sentence in a document.

Tokenizer
=========
Re-trained model on move varied data set.

Parser
======
Changed numerous List return types to Parse arrays.


1.1.0

Summary
=======
This is mostly a parser performance release.  However there are some bug fixes as well.

General
=======
Modified BeamSearch to be more efficient and take parameters to allow for early cut-off
of pathes.
Fixed bug where beam was larger than the number of outcomes.
Fixed bug where the beam was being made larger because array was sorted the other way.
Changed beam to alway advance some path to prevent pos-tagger from not returning a
sequence if the tag dictionary only contains an unlikly tag.

Parser
======
Fixed bug in chunker context generation.
Change code to use specific context generator rather than most general interface.
Changed chunking phase to stop chunk sequences which will never make the top K.
Other general optimizations.

1.0.0
-----
These changes represent what went into this release since many of these 
components were part of the GROK project.

Summary
=======
Moved sentence, tokenization, and pos tagging out of grok and into
main opennlp package and retrained models.  Added parser, chunker, and named 
entity detection.

General
=======
Added Span class to util for token training.

Remove Pipelink dependicies from above packages in order to minimize 
dependicies

Made "taggers" use common beam search code.

Sentence Detection
==================
Retrained to create new data/EnglishSD.bin.gz
Fixed context creation bug.

Tokenization
============
Changed tokenization features.

Removed possesive hack since trained model now correctly tokenizes
these constructions.

TokSpanEventStream allows tokenizer to be trained with offsets.

Added ALPHA_NUMERIC_OPTIMAZATION flag so this can be turned off for
other types of tokenization.

Retrain to create new data/EnglishTok.bin.gz

Part-Of-Speech Tagger
=====================
Create POSEventStream for training.
Retrained to create new data/EnglishPOS.bin.gz
Added tag dictionary

Parser
======
Integrated full parser and trained.

Named Finding
=============
Integrated name finder and trained models.
