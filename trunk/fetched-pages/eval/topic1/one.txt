Australia's 18-year-old rep, Kimberley Busteed, was knocked out in the first round, but at least she didn't burst into tears like some of the other 76 losers.		"It didn't even faze me, to tell you the truth, after being out that soon," Busteed said yesterday.		"I couldn't stop smiling - I had such a ball being up there.		"There were a few that were really devastated, which was a bit heartbreaking to see, but you just had to remind them that life's huge and this is just one little thing in their lives."	# Once more: 10 of the best from Miss Universe 2007		The small-town girl from Queensland said she was shocked by the competitive nature of the South Americans and the round-the-clock, heavily made-up glamour of many of the contestants.		"There was a lot of make-up, and the thing that amazed me is the fact that the girls can put up with the pain of wearing high heels all the time," Busteed said.		"I couldn't wait to wear flats."		Speaking before boarding a plane in Los Angeles for Australia, Busteed fobbed off criticism of her lifesaver-themed national costume.		"I would do it again 100 times over," she said.		Billionaire pageant owner Donald Trump was in Mexico City, where the finals took place, to comfort US rep Rachel Smith, who fell in the evening wear parade and was the victim of aggressive heckling.		"She took it personally, and I told her they were not booing her, they were booing the policies of the United States," Trump said.
