http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7745932.html Photobucket to become part of MySpace as parent buys 2 companies to become part of MySpace as parent buys 2 companies AM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - A Web site that enables its users to store photos and video for inclusion in MySpace profiles will become a part of the popular online hangout. MySpace's parent, News Corp.'s Fox Interactive Media, agreed to acquire Photobucket Inc. just weeks after a public spat in which MySpace partially blocked content from Photobucket. The block was mysteriously lifted after about two weeks, but both sides had been silent on the details of their peacemaking. Fox also agreed separately to buy Flektor Inc., which offers Web-based tools for creating slideshows, video mash-ups and other interactive presentations. Financial terms of the two deals were not disclosed. MySpace users often embed third-party photos, video and other material in their personal profile pages, and sites like Photobucket and Google Inc.'s YouTube make that easy by providing the programming code to cut and paste into MySpace pages. The practice has made Photobucket one of the leading sites on the Internet, even though relatively few access content directly through its home page. The Photobucket block, which occurred in April, followed MySpace's complaints that the hosting service had been encouraging users to incorporate an ad-supported slideshow into their MySpace profiles. MySpace said the sideshow violated its policies banning unauthorized commercial activities. Photobucket's chief executive, Alex Welch, responded by accusing MySpace of limiting free expression and treating users as a commodity. He was more conciliatory two weeks later, saying the two had "established open lines of communication and procedures," but he made no mention of any negotiations over a sale of his company. Fox's agreements to purchase Photobucket and Flektor represent the latest acquisitions of startups by a larger Internet company. In November, Google bought video-sharing site YouTube for $1.76 billion.
http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7764687.html Gates, Jobs make rare joint appearance at technology conference Jobs make rare joint appearance at technology conference AM PDT CARLSBAD, Calif. (AP) - Legendary technology rivals Bill Gates and Steve Jobs made a rare joint appearance Wednesday and wasted no time making nice. "Bill built the first software company in the industry," said Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc. "Bill focused on software before anyone." Gates, the Microsoft Corp. co-founder, hailed Jobs for taking big risks and developing products with "incredible taste and elegance." "What Steve has done is quite phenomenal," Gates said. That set the tone for a 90-minute chat in which the two computer industry icons fielded questions from Wall Street Journal columnist Walt Mossberg and technology reporter Kara Swisher at the newspaper's "D: All Things Digital" conference. Jobs and Gates reminisced about early days working together in the 1970s, interspersing their views on the current state of technology. When Swisher asked for the greatest misunderstanding about their relationship, Jobs joked: "We've kept our marriage secret for over a decade now." Gates added: "Neither of us have anything to complain about, in general. It's been fun to work together." The two briefly discussed the 2008 elections. Gates said candidates should be measured on their ideas for improving education. Gates and his wife, Melinda, created the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2000, which is now the world's largest philanthropic foundation. The foundation gives a majority of its grants in the areas of world health, global development and education. Although the two companies worked together in the 1970s - Microsoft even invested in a struggling Apple in 1997 - they have remained fierce rivals. Gates dropped out of Harvard University in 1975 to found Microsoft with childhood friend Paul Allen and turned the company into the world's largest maker of computer software. Jobs and friend Steve Wozniak founded Apple in 1976, five years before IBM Corp. jumped into the personal computer market. Jobs left Apple in 1985 following a struggle with the company's board but made a triumphant return in 1997 when Apple was struggling to survive. Jobs is widely credited for Apple's renaissance with a string of innovative products - the iMac computer for consumers, the powerful PowerMac and PowerBook, and more recently, the iPod digital music player. Microsoft has long dominated with its Windows operating system and software programs like Word and Excel, but Apple scored big with its iPod, introduced in 2001, and its iTunes online music store. Next month, Apple introduces its much-anticipated iPhone mobile handset. Microsoft released the Zune music player in November to compete with iPod. An audience member later asked the two men what they learned from each other. "The way he does things is just different. It's magical," Gates said. Jobs said he admired Microsoft's ability to collaborate with other technology companies. "They learned how to partner with people really well, and I think if Apple could have had a little more of that in its DNA, it would have served it extremely well," he said.
http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7746007.html Animal CSIs taking a bite out of crime CSIs taking a bite out of crime Forensic Scientist Ngyuen Truong inspects a tray of samples for DNA testing before placing it in separator at the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at the University of California Davis. AM PDT RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - When Marylin Christian's beloved cat Cody was found dead under suspicious circumstances two years ago, she vowed to seek justice. But when Christian suggested that animal control officers collect saliva from a neighbor's dog, Lucky, to see if it could be genetically linked to hair found in Cody's mouth and claws, she was met with bewilderment. "They kind of acted like, 'Well, you've been watching a little too much 'CSI,"' Christian recalled with a laugh. Christian eventually paid $500 for the evidence to be tested at the Veterinary Genetics Lab at the University of California at Davis, which has the largest database of domesticated-animal DNA in the country. The result? A one in 67 million chance the hair belonged to any animal other than Lucky. "Usually, people come to us because it's a very emotional matter," said Beth Wictum, acting director of the lab's forensics division. "They've lost a pet, and for many people, pets are a member of the family and they want to get resolution." In the time that's passed since Christian's loss, more and more law enforcement officials have come to share her interest in applying forensic methods to cases involving animals - whether the animal is a victim, perpetrator, or even a witness. "There's some real serious cases where animal DNA played a role in helping solve the case," said Denver District Attorney Mitch Morrissey, a DNA expert who has asked investigators to collect DNA samples from murder suspects' pets at crime scenes. "I believe that it will be used more and more." Wictum's lab handles between 150 and 200 cases a year from all over the world. But scientists don't just deal with pet-on-pet attacks. They process evidence from cases involving animal attacks on humans, human attacks on animals, and even human crimes against each other in which an animal may yield important clues. In one case, the lab used DNA testing to match dog excrement found on the bottom of a murder suspect's shoe to excrement found near the crime scene - a piece of evidence that helped secure the man's conviction. In another case, a sexual assault victim couldn't pick her attacker out of a lineup - but she remembered her dog had urinated on the man's pickup truck. The dog's DNA matched DNA traces found on the truck's tire and the suspect pleaded guilty. ASPCA forensic veterinarian Melinda Merck relies on the same techniques as standard crime scene investigators - ballistics, toxicology, blood spatter analysis - to help solve animal cruelty cases across the country. "It's rapidly growing," she said of her specialty. "There is a tremendous interest from the veterinarians and there's a tremendous interest from law enforcement." Last year, Merck testified in the Atlanta trial of two teenage brothers who tortured a puppy and left it in an oven to die. Merck was able to prove the puppy was alive when it was tortured and reconstructed the animal's grim final moments for a jury. The brothers were sentenced to a maximum punishment of 10 years in prison. Even forensic entomologists - who use insects such as maggots to help estimate a victim's time of death - have crossed over into the world of animal-related crimes. Forensic entomologist Jason Byrd often is called on to help investigators with wildlife crimes and poaching cases. If a bald eagle is shot at a game reserve, Byrd can examine the maggots on the bird's carcass to help determine its time of death. Investigators then can access the records at the reserve to narrow down who was in the area at the time of the shooting. "They're not scared to spend money now to figure out who's been poaching animals," Byrd said. "Now they do true investigation techniques - they throw forensic science at the problem." As the field of animal forensics grows, so does the need for training. Colleges are just beginning to take note. This year, Purdue University's School of Veterinary Medicine began offering a forensic veterinary medicine course, believed to be the first of its kind in the country, said professor Janice Sojka. Sojka said she recognized a need for the course after noticing a recent explosion of interest in the field. "With 'CSI' and 'Law & Order,' people kind of know what's out there and what can be done and then there's a growing expectation that you'll do that for your animals," she said. "It's become a lot more respected." Despite the fact that Christian got DNA results, animal control officers refused to declare Lucky a dangerous dog. Lucky and his owners have since moved away. And even though her CSI-style pursuit of justice was expensive and frustrating, the stay-at-home mother of two has no regrets. "I felt like I needed to do it for my family," she said. "The two-legged and the four-legged."
http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7745957.html Spring blockbusters jump from theater to game console blockbusters jump from theater to game console AM PDT Why do video-game publishers bother with movie tie-ins? The cost of licensing an anticipated blockbuster (like, say, this summer's "Transformers") is expensive. Designers have to work within creative constraints imposed by the Hollywood studio, and then have to rush to crank out something playable by the time the movie's released. And usually no one - neither gamers nor moviegoers - is satisfied with the results. And yet, the combination of an appealing license and decent gameplay can lead to a blockbuster game. THQ sold more than 2.6 million copies of its engaging "Cars" title, making it the second best-selling game of the year (after "Madden NFL 07"). On the other hand, you have disasters like Electronic Arts' "Superman Returns," which was delayed nearly five months after the movie's release and flatlined at retail. The three franchises spun off here have all been made into games before. Earlier "Spider-Man" games have done well, but critics have been unimpressed by previous "Pirates" and "Shrek" efforts. Let's see where they stand in 2007. -"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" (Disney, for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, $59.99; Wii, $49.99; PlayStation 2, $39.99): The latest "Pirates" game is kind of a mash-up of the last two films in the trilogy, following Capt. Jack Sparrow's quest to retrieve Davy Jones' heart. Actually, it's difficult to make out that plot if you haven't seen the films; then again, many "Pirates" viewers have left theaters confused. Most of the game consists of swordplay against redcoats, monsters or other pirates, but there's not much skill involved and the fights get monotonous. There are a few decent boss battles that are a bit more challenging, as well as some simple platform sequences and a diverting game of liar's dice. Jack is usually front and center, but sometimes you get to play as Elizabeth Swann or Will Turner. Alas, none of the film's stars showed up for voiceover work, but their digital likenesses are pretty good, especially on the Xbox 360. Two stars out of four. -"Shrek the Third" (Activision, for the Xbox 360, Wii, $49.99; PlayStation 2, $39.99): You won't hear the voices of Mike Myers or Eddie Murphy here, either, but the video-game versions of Shrek and Donkey are otherwise indistinguishable from their computer-generated big-screen counterparts. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this game is the way it tells the story of "Shrek the Third" through oddly amusing two-dimensional puppet shows. The actual gameplay is woefully slapdash, consisting mostly of Shrek running around and beating up various fairy-tale villains. At times you'll switch to a supporting character, like Fiona or Puss in Boots, but the action still involves plowing through waves of enemies. Occasional sequences where you need to jump around obstacles are marred by sloppy controls and bad camera angles. "Shrek the Third" also offers a handful of lackluster minigames, like frog-herding and shuffleboard. (Really.) Overall, it seems like a wasted opportunity - although its flaws probably won't stop it from becoming a best-seller. One-and-a-half stars. -"Spider-Man 3" (Activision, for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, $59.99; Wii, $49.99; PlayStation 2, $39.99): "Spider-Man 3" looks likely to be the box-office winner among this year's "part 3s," and it squeaks out a victory in the game department, too. Then again, developer Treyarch has created three previous Spidey games, so it's disappointing that this game isn't better. It's still a rush to swing around Manhattan's skyscrapers, and it's nice to have the freedom to choose which missions you want to take on. But there's almost too much going on; you'll spend way too much time fighting gangs that have nothing to do with the movie's story. Unfortunately, the fights are tedious - until you take on a boss like New Goblin or Kingpin, when the fights become long and tedious. While we're glad to have voiceovers from Tobey Maguire and Bruce Campbell, the graphics on the 360 and PS3 aren't as slick as we'd expected. And the PS2 and Wii versions (not developed by Treyarch) are even uglier. Two-and-a-half stars.

http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7764732.html Agency aims to help spies with new technology aims to help spies with new technology This photo shows a Micro Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Dragonfly, developed by CIA in the 1970s, this micro UAV was the first flight of an insect-sized vehicle. AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - Using a new laptop and a satellite link, FBI agents can find out within two minutes whether the fingerprint from a newly captured suspect overseas matches a terrorist database in Virginia. Intelligence officials are running documents in languages such as Arabic through a new computer program called "English Now." It converts the foreign characters into the Roman alphabet and makes words such as Baghdad, President Bush or Osama bin Laden jump out to spies who can't read Arabic. The language software and the fingerprint-recognition system are examples of new spy gear that the national intelligence director's office bought last year. They may seem like tools that should have been available years ago, but the government isn't noted for its ability to quickly develop new technology. A fledging center called IARPA is hoping to change that. The Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity will try to develop groundbreaking technology for the 16 spy agencies. One potential tool sounds like it comes from an episode of Star Trek: "cloaking" technology that can bend radar around an object to make it appear it's not there. Others include power sources shrunk using nanotechnology and quantum computers that can speed code-breaking, says IARPA acting director Steve Nixon. "The world has changed in dramatic ways with globalization of technology," Nixon said in an interview. "These are the things that might not get done otherwise." But not everyone is convinced this is the right way to make new spy tools. The House Intelligence Committee has questions about whether the government truly needs it. "Much of this research is already going on," said Rep. Heather Wilson, R-N.M., the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee's panel on technical intelligence. She said IARPA raises questions about the role of new National Intelligence Director Mike McConnell, who was supposed to coordinate U.S. intelligence agencies - not get into their daily operations. "Is it to fund these things and pull them into the DNI's office and give itself its own turf and projects and pet rocks?" she asked. There is even resistance within the CIA itself, according to officials who spoke about the concerns privately. The agency gets money that is supposed to go for spy tools that can be shared across the government. CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano denied any friction, saying the agency welcomes ideas that promote collaboration on new technology. In the last half-century, U.S. spy agencies have made technical breakthroughs large and small. In the 1970s, the CIA shared its lithium-iodine batteries with the medical field, which now uses them in pacemakers. Its scientists developed microdot cameras that can produce images so small that they can be hidden in the period of this sentence. They also built a life-size robotic dragonfly that could have been used for surveillance, if only it could have handled crosswinds. If IARPA can clear some crucial hurdles, including convincing its congressional skeptics, the new office will be modeled after a similar agency that develops gee-whiz toys for the Pentagon. The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency was created after the Russians launched Sputnik in 1957, driving home the U.S. competitive disadvantage in space. Since then, DARPA researchers have brought the United States much-heralded advances including stealth technology, global positioning systems and the Internet. But it also brought controversy. The agency's Total Information Awareness data-mining program was launched after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to use technology to find terrorists; critics saw it as a step toward Big Brother-style mass government surveillance. Congress eliminated the program's funding at DARPA in 2003, but portions were moved to secret accounts at other agencies. The new intelligence organization will be significantly smaller than DARPA, which has a $3 billion annual budget. It will be based at the University of Maryland and staffed with 56 intelligence professionals from the CIA and from McConnell's organization. Rather than funding IARPA in the House intelligence budget bill passed this month, lawmakers directed technology dollars to centers developing tools that can be shared across government, including offices within the CIA, National Security Agency and National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The measure included criticism of McConnell's office for failing to provide details on how IARPA will work and raised questions about whether it would harm existing research for spy tools. Nixon says IARPA won't have labs and electron microscopes, but will sponsor research at universities, national labs and other organizations. IARPA is thinking broadly, he said. It won't limit itself to hard sciences, but will also tackle social-science problems such as finding tools for language research or to help analysts measure cultural habits of another society. He also said the organization will work on privacy protection. NSA and other agencies want to be able to make better use of foreign intelligence information from overseas, which often contains information on U.S. citizens. Given the lack of oversight in intelligence agencies, "this is an area where the research community has to step gingerly," said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center.
http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7764597.html Developer halts construction after receiving 1 million protest text messages halts construction after receiving 1 million protest text messages AM PDT BEIJING (AP) - A Chinese city has halted construction of a chemical plant after residents sent more than 1 million mobile phone text messages protesting possible pollution dangers, news reports said Thursday. The $1.4 billion facility being built by Tenglong Aromatic PX (Xiamen) Co. Ltd to produce the petrochemical paraxylene was planned for the booming southeastern port of Xiamen, the Xinhua News Agency and newspapers said. "The Xiamen city government has decided to suspend construction of the PX (paraxylene) plant in Haicang District," a deputy mayor, Ding Guoyan, was quoted as saying by Xinhua. "The city government has listened to the opinions expressed and has decided, after careful deliberation, that the project must be re-evaluated." Paraxylene is used in production of plastics, polyester and film. Short-term exposure to paraxylene can cause eye, nose or throat irritation in humans, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Chronic exposure can affect the central nervous system and may cause death. The plant was due to be located 10 miles from the center of Xiamen, a center for Taiwanese and Hong Kong investment. The nearest homes were one mile away, according to news reports. Demand for chemicals such as paraxylene is soaring as China's export-driven manufacturing industries expand. The communist government, long indifferent to the environmental cost of China's economic boom, has become more sensitive to pollution complaints after accidents that polluted rivers, disrupting water supplies to major cities. Farmers in areas throughout the country have protested over pollution that has tainted water supplies and ruined farmland. Xiamen residents sent more than 1 million text messages protesting plans to build the plant, Xinhua said. The suspension of the Xiamen project coincides with government efforts to slow an investment boom in industries where supplies of factories and other assets exceed demand. Last week, a state news agency quoted officials who cited public concerns about radiation exposure in announcing the suspension of work on a futuristic magnetic-levitation train line in Shanghai that critics said was too expensive and impractical. Irving, Texas-based ExxonMobil Corp.; Saudi Aramco, the Saudi government oil company; and China's No. 2 oil company, China Petroleum & Chemical Co., better known as Sinopec, announced in March they were expanding a joint venture chemical plant in the southeastern city of Quanzhou to produce paraxylene and other chemicals.
http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7764662.html Cosmonauts install protective panels on international space station install protective panels on international space station AM PDT CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) - Two Russian cosmonauts climbed out of the international space station Wednesday to install protective panels designed to shield the orbiting outpost from dangerous space debris. Commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and flight engineer Oleg Kotov opened a hatch on the Russian side of the space station at 3:05 p.m. EDT. The spacewalk ended about 5½ hours later. "Hooray! We're back home!" one of the cosmonauts said after climbing back into the space station airlock. The only lament from the first-time spacewalkers came at the end, from a cosmonaut who complained about an ill-fitted glove on his spacesuit. Both men were tethered during the spacewalk to keep them from floating away. The station's third occupant, U.S. astronaut Sunita Williams, remained inside. Space debris includes objects such as discarded rocket parts, planetary dust and rocks. Scientists consider it the greatest threat to the space station, orbiting about 220 miles above Earth. Kotov rode at the end of a crane operated by Yurchikhin to reach the stack of aluminum panels about 60 feet from the hatch. The 17 protective panels, each about 2 feet by 3 feet and weighing about 20 pounds, were delivered to the station last December and left outside in a formation dubbed "the Christmas tree." The cosmonauts installed five of the panels on a Russian section of the space station, and the others were to be put in place during a spacewalk next week. Engineers on the ground are able to monitor by radar the largest pieces of space debris - objects larger than a softball - and adjust the station's position accordingly, so the shielding will protect against smaller objects. "The consequence of small particles is not so great," said Kirk Shireman, NASA's deputy program manager for the space station. "Then there are the midrange particles. Those are the ones we worry about." An independent safety task force in February said that there was a 9 percent risk that the space station, once completed in 2010, could be hit with space debris severe enough to cause the loss of the outpost or crew members. That risk estimate was reduced to 5 percent if protective panels were installed on Russian portions of the space station. Sections of the space station built by NASA and the Japanese and European space agencies were protected sufficiently against space debris, the task force said. The spacewalk started about 45 minutes late, but a bright moon allowed the cosmonauts to catch up by working through what normally would have been darkness after orbital sunsets. The space station circles the Earth every 90 minutes. Asked by Mission Control in Moscow how it felt in their spacesuits once they were outside, one of the cosmonauts joked: "Kind of cloudy, a bit rainy. We didn't take an umbrella with us." The cosmonauts also successfully rerouted a cable for a navigation antenna that will be used later in the year for the first flight of a new European cargo vehicle. Wednesday's spacewalk was the first of two scheduled a week apart. Yurchikhin and Kotov will perform another one next Wednesday with similar tasks, including depositing canisters containing biological experiments outside the station. Space shuttle Atlantis and its seven astronauts are scheduled to fly to the station early next month. NASA managers on Wednesday began a two-day meeting at the Kennedy Space Center to decide whether to go ahead with the planned June 8 launch. A final decision was expected Thursday for the launch, which previously was postponed from mid-March because of a hailstorm that damaged the insulating foam on the shuttle's external tank.
http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7745882.html Google chairman dismisses privacy issue over proposed DoubleClick deal chairman dismisses privacy issue over proposed DoubleClick deal AM PDT SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - Google Chairman Eric Schmidt said Wednesday that U.S. regulatory approval of his company's proposed acquisition of DoubleClick will not be hindered by concerns over privacy. "We're quite convinced that the proposed merger meets all of the appropriate U.S. laws and is ultimately very good for consumers and for advertisers and publishers," Schmidt said at a news conference. Google, the world's No. 1 Internet search engine company, announced its plan to buy New York-based DoubleClick Inc. last month in a $3.1 billion acquisition that privacy advocates have urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate. DoubleClick helps its customers place and track online advertising, including search ads, which Google - more than its nearest search competitors Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft Corp. - has turned into an extremely lucrative business. Google confirmed Tuesday that the FTC is conducting an antitrust review of the deal. Typically, antitrust reviews focus on monopoly concerns. But there is precedent for them to address privacy issues, analysts say. Schmidt said that Google, when considering the acquisition, "looked very carefully" at privacy and other issues that would come under legal review "because we knew competitors would raise those issues, as indeed they have." Mountain View, California-based Google Inc. is "not concerned that the choice of the FTC brings in some new issue that we had not thought about," Schmidt said. Schmidt was in South Korea to participate in the Seoul Digital Forum 2007, a three-day gathering of technology and media industry leaders organized by South Korean TV network SBS. Schmidt predicted Google would clear all regulatory hurdles and complete the acquisition by the end of 2007. He reiterated that view Wednesday, saying, "we're hoping to close later this year." Several consumer advocacy groups, led by the Electronic Privacy Information Center, urged the FTC to investigate the privacy implications of the acquisition. The groups said in their April 20 complaint that the two companies, when combined, would have access to an unprecedented amount of data on consumers' Web usage and Internet search habits. Regarding other possible acquisitions, Schmidt said Google is "always open" to the idea. DoubleClick had been the target of a fierce bidding war between Google and Microsoft. The Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft earlier this month agreed to buy U.S.-based online advertising firm aQuantive Inc. and has reportedly been in discussions with Yahoo for a possible merger or takeover. Schmidt carefully steered clear of any comment on Microsoft when asked about the company's activities. "We are not very focused on our competitors and so I won't speculate on Microsoft's current or future M&A activities," he said. "We've found it better to stay focused on our mission, our advertisers, our partners and our global presence as we're doing today."
http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7751087.html Apple debuts songs online free of copy restrictions debuts songs online free of copy restrictions PM PDT PM PDT SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) - Apple Inc.'s iTunes Store started selling thousands of songs without copy protection Wednesday, marking the trendsetting company's latest coup and a model for what analysts say will likely become a pattern for online music sales. Launching initially with songs from music company EMI Group PLC, iTunes Plus features tracks that are free of digital rights management, or DRM, technology - copy-protection software that limits where songs or movies can be played and distributed. The unrestricted content means some songs purchased from iTunes will work for the first time directly on portable players other than Apple's iPod, including Microsoft Corp.'s Zune. The inaugural batch of iTunes Plus songs includes music from Coldplay, The Rolling Stones, Norah Jones, Frank Sinatra, Pink Floyd and more than a dozen of Paul McCartney's classic albums. The DRM-free tracks feature a higher sound quality and cost $1.29 apiece - 30 cents more than the usual 99-cent price of other, copy-protected songs at the market-leading online music store. If available, users can upgrade existing purchases to DRM-free versions for 30 cents a song or $3 for most albums, Apple said. London-based EMI, the world's third-largest music company by sales, and Cupertino-based Apple announced their partnership in April to deliver the industry's first major offering of DRM-free songs, sharing a vision of what both companies say their consumers want: flexibility and CD-audio quality. Other smaller online music vendors, such as eMusic.com, already offer songs without DRM, but the selections have been limited to mostly content from independent labels. Barney Wragg, the global head of digital music at EMI, said the iTunes Plus launch capped six months of work to convert most all of the company's digital catalog into a DRM-free format. "Our customers told us two things deterred them from buying digital," Wragg said. "They weren't 100 percent confident that the songs they'd purchase could play on their devices, and they wanted something closer to CD quality." Earlier this year, Apple CEO Steve Jobs called on the world's four major record companies to start selling songs online without copy-protection software. "We definitely think it's the right thing to do," Eddy Cue, Apple's vice president of iTunes, said Wednesday. "In this case, EMI's a leader and we think others will follow." In a statement Wednesday, Jobs reiterated that Apple expects that more than half of the 5 million songs on iTunes will feature a DRM-free version by the end of the year. In the meantime, Apple's iTunes Store will continue to offer songs in the same copy-protected format as today at 99 cents per download and encoded at 128 kilobits per second. The iTunes Plus versions are encoded at 256 kbps, which Apple says makes the audio quality on par with original recordings. Apple also will continue to encode its songs - including EMI's DRM-free content - in the AAC audio format, which could force some users to go through an extra step of converting tunes into a version that would be compatible with their players. Some gadgets don't support AAC, including SanDisk's newest Sansa Connect or Samsung Electronics Co.'s YP-K3, but industry analyst Susan Kevorkian of the IDC market research company expects support for AAC will widen following Apple's move this week. Amazon.com Inc., by comparison, said it plans to sell songs online later this year in the DRM-free MP3 format - the popular unrestricted audio standard that is supported by virtually every device, including Apple's best-selling iPod. The next generation of digital music will be untethered from usage restrictions, Kevorkian predicts. It's something major music labels - other than just EMI - will have to do if they want to combat the industry's years long decline of music CD sales, she said. "They absolutely have to reach the Internet to drive music sales, and part of that is to remove the hurdle that comes with the lack of interoperability," Kevorkian said. Other major music labels - Sony BMG Music Entertainment, Universal Music Group and Warner Music - have all experimented with limited amounts of unprotected content online but have yet to make as aggressive a move as EMI. Representatives of Warner and Sony BMG declined to comment Wednesday about the iTunes Plus offering or their own plans around DRM technology. Universal did not return a call for comment. Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at JupiterResearch, said any worries the music companies have over increased piracy from DRM-free downloads are overblown. "CDs are all sold without copy protection already, so these (unrestricted) digital files are not going to change the piracy story," he said. "People who aren't going to pay for things aren't going to pay for things, and DRM just adds an unnecessary layer of complexity here for people who do embrace this medium and have already bought billions of songs on iTunes." Shares of Apple closed at $118.77, up $4.42, or nearly 4 percent, and gained another 65 cents in extended trading. In a separate announcement after the stock market closed, Apple said it will soon introduce direct access to YouTube videos from its Apple TV set-top-box device. It also announced a beefier, 160-gigabyte Apple TV model that will be available starting Thursday for $399.
http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7744297.html PM PDT SEATTLE (AP) - Microsoft Corp. has taken the wraps off "Surface," a coffee-table shaped computer that responds to touch and to special bar codes attached to everyday objects. The machines, which Microsoft planned to debut Wednesday at a technology conference in Carlsbad, Calif., are set to arrive in November in T-Mobile USA stores and properties owned by Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. and Harrah's Entertainment Inc. Surface is essentially a Windows Vista PC tucked inside a shiny black table base, topped with a 30-inch touchscreen in a clear acrylic frame. Five cameras that can sense nearby objects are mounted beneath the screen. Users can interact with the machine by touching or dragging their fingertips and objects such as paintbrushes across the screen, or by setting real-world items tagged with special bar-code labels on top of it. Unlike most touchscreens, Surface can respond to more than one touch at a time. During a demonstration with a reporter last week, Mark Bolger, the Surface Computing group's marketing director, "dipped" his finger in an on-screen paint palette, then dragged it across the screen to draw a smiley face. Then he used all 10 fingers at once to give the face a full head of hair. With a price tag between $5,000 and $10,000 per unit, Microsoft isn't immediately aiming for the finger painting set. (The company said it expects prices to drop enough to make consumer versions feasible in three to five years.) Some of the first Surface models are planned to help customers pick out new cell phones at T-Mobile stores. When customers plop a phone down on the screen, Surface will read its bar code and display information about the handset. Customers can also select calling plans and ringtones by dragging icons toward the phone. Guests sitting in some Starwood Hotel lobbies will be able to cluster around the Surface to play music, then buy songs using a credit card or rewards card tagged with a bar code. In some hotel restaurants, customers will be able to order food and drinks, then split the bill by setting down a card or a room key and dragging their menu items "onto" the card. At Harrah's locations, visitors will be able to learn about nearby Harrah's venues on an interactive map, then book show tickets or make dinner reservations. Microsoft is working on a limited number of programs to ship with Surface, including one for sharing digital photographs. Bolger placed a card with a bar code onto Surface's surface; digital photographs appeared to spill out of the card into piles on the screen. Several people gathered around the table pulled photos across the screen using their fingertips, rotated them in circles and even dragged out the corners to enlarge the images - behavior made possible by the advanced graphics support deep inside Windows Vista. "It's not a touch screen, it's a grab screen," Bolger said. Historically, Microsoft has focused on creating new software, giving computer programmers tools to build applications on its platforms, and left hardware manufacturing to others. (Some recent exceptions include the Xbox 360 and the Zune music player, made by the same Microsoft division that developed Surface.) For now, Microsoft is making the Surface hardware itself, and has only given six outside software development firms the tools they need to make Surface applications. Matt Rosoff, an analyst at the independent research group Directions on Microsoft, said in an interview that keeping the technology's inner workings under wraps will limit what early customers - the businesses Microsoft is targeting first with the machine - will be able to do with it. But overall, analysts who cover the PC industry were wowed by Surface. Surface is "important for Microsoft as a promising new business, as well as demonstrating very concretely to the market that Microsoft still knows how to innovate, and innovate in a big way," said Michael Gartenberg, an analyst at Jupiter Research.
