Evans There are a few original ideas in this new spin on the serial killer thriller, but they tend to get bogged down in a plot that's slow, convoluted and even more schizophrenic than Mr. Brooks himself. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a well-respected businessman and a loving husband and father, who just so happens to also be a brutal, methodical serial killer who has never been caught until a photographer (Dane Cook) gets pictures of him in the act and threatens to reveal his secret unless he takes him along on his next killing. Meanwhile, a tough detective (Demi Moore) is trying to catch the killer while dealing with a bitter divorce and other more dangerous problems. You don't have to wait too long while watching this psychological thriller before the big reveal that Kevin Costner's highly-lauded business magnate Earl Brooks has a secret addiction to killing people. Even before we see him in action, we learn how this secret affects him in the form of William Hurt's Marshall, a talkative alter ego who acts as Brooks' bad conscious, egging him on to do these very bad things. This idea was just as interesting when used in "Fight Club" and "Harvey," but here it's revealed way too early and then it's quickly overused to the point where it gets tiresome. Obviously, director Bruce A. Evans, who's written many strong movies and a couple weaker ones, knows where the money lies in his twist on the serial killer genre, and that's in the interplay between Kevin Coster and William Hurt as the good and evil within this conflicted family man. It's not a bad role for Costner, because we get to see him playing with a few more emotions and moods than we've seen from him in the past, but for the most part, he's a bit too soft and sympathetic in the role, which is why it's good to have Hurt around as the bad guy, to take the heat off Costner while continuing down the path he began in Cronenberg's "A History of Violence." Essentially, Marshall appears in most of the scenes having side conversations with Mr. Brooks as he deals with his own conscience and desire to give up killing, but that plan hits a stumbling block when a photographer played by Dane Cook blackmails Brooks into including him in his next killing. Cook isn't bad as the pesky tagalong in his first dramatic role, and the shaky relationship between the duo adds another level to the tense relationship between Brooks and his alter ego, but Marshall probably puts it best when he says, "He could be funny and charming and I still wouldn't like him." It's almost like Marshall is saying exactly what we, the viewer, is thinking, because Cook might only be bearable if you're already a fan of his neurotic overly-caffeinated personality. The last player in the story is Demi Moore's Detective Tracy Atwood, the criminal profiler who has been trailing Brooks (known as "The Thumbprint Killer") for years, and has been having difficulty settling a messy divorce case with her ex-husband who wants a sizeable chunk of her trust fund. (At first, you may wonder how he can possibly expect to get a $1.5 million settlement from a police detective, but it's explained soon enough.) Even if her character is very much a stereotype in the mold of Clarice Starling or Angelina Jolie's character from "Taking Lives," it's a fine return to form by Moore as a tough female character who might have been just as interesting a character to follow as Brooks and his associates. For a purported thriller, "Mr. Brooks" is fairly tame, not offering anything really surprising or shocking after Brooks' first on-screen murders, his weapon of choice making it fairly quick work. Otherwise, the movie is very slow, consisting mainly of talking heads scenes between the various characters and a ridiculous number of overlapping subplots, many of which don't seem particularly necessary to tell the main story, which should be about how Mr. Brooks copes with his addiction and his alter ego. The tone switches drastically whenever Costner is dealing with his drama at home involving his daughter Jane, leading to another tangential subplot, but they also needlessly try to build-up Moore's character with excessive conflicts. At the same time as this mess divorce, she also has to contend with an escaped serial killer trying to get revenge on her for putting him away. It gets confusing as Atwood is looking for Brooks one moment and the next she's off after this other escaped killer. This latter part offers the movie's only real action scenes, all of which come from out of nowhere as if Evans realizes he's losing people with the amount of talking and needs to throw in a few shootouts and the like to show how tough Moore is as a police officer. (Her partner is noticeably absent whenever she's caught in these conflicts.) It just doesn't seem like a very well developed or structured script--holding off the Costner/Hurt relationship for thirty minutes would have helped greatly--and the standard dialogue is only elevated by the fact that Evans has such a strong cast delivering it, with Hurt clearly getting the best role and lines, as he voices his opinion on everything going around Brooks and offers his malignant advice. Unfortunately, he also telegraphs a lot of what's going to happen and what Brooks is going to do, and there aren't any interesting twists or scares until the very end, when we finally get to see Costner show Brooks' evil without Hurt acting as his crutch. It's another one of those cases where nothing happens for so long that something had to happen eventually or one might feel cheated. Still, it's a shame that with two of the '90s strongest dramatic actors in Costner and Moore, we never get to see a single scene of the two on-screen together, something that would have certainly added another level to the movie and seems like a missed opportunity. "Mr. Brooks" isn't the worst thriller ever made, though there's a certain '90s throwback quality to it that takes away from it feeling particularly new or innovative. If you feel the need to see yet another twist on the serial killer genre than "Mr. Brooks" offers a few things to make it worthwhile, particularly the interplay between Costner and Hurt as the title character, but the convoluted plot and plodding pace kills any sense of there being any actual thrills involved.

Let's go to Potterland Harry Potter, played by Daniel Radcliffe, attempts to defend himself as the Dementors attack in the forthcoming movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Photograph: Murray Close/Warner Bros Until now the legions of Harry Potter fans have had to make do with visiting the rather underwhelming at King's Cross station or recreating Quidditch games with the kitchen mop. But not for much longer. It's been long in the rumour mill but Harry Potter fans will soon be able to enjoy the magic of Hogwarts at a Harry Potter theme park Followers of the teenage wizard will be able to visit many of the famous locations that have been brought to life in the Potter series, such as Hogwarts castle, the village of Hogsmeade and the mysterious Forbidden Forest. Creators of the park say they aim to create an authentic representation of JK Rowling's vision. The park is not due to open until 2009 at Universal Studio's amusement park in Orlando, Florida, but what are a few more years when you've waited a decade already? And true Harry Potter fans will have mastered the art of waiting thanks to many weeks' practice, bearing up under the media hype preceding each new book and film release. It also leaves plenty of time for fans to imagine what would go into their own Harry Potter World - surely almost as much fun as going on the rides themselves. Suggestions on several fans' websites already include: Soar through the air on your very own hippogriff. (Picture something like the Flying Dumbo ride at Disney World.) The Whomping Whillow ride: This would have separate arm cages that people would get in (think of an octopus). Then all the arms would go up into the air, and swing into the centre, or out, as the base rotated. This is an indoor version of Disneyland's Matterhorn ride, but bigger, with laser effects and spooky sounds. At least some of the ride operators should be dressed as Dementors. JK Rowling's books have sold 325 million copies worldwide and inspired five blockbuster movies so creators are confident the theme park will be a hit - although some fans may be dismayed to hear it is going to be based in the US rather than its literary home, the UK.

But still, Daniel Radcliffe is touchingly coy when I ask him about Harry Potter's first screen kiss. As readers of JK Rowling's novels know, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the one where the 15-year-old boy wizard starts grappling with manhood. In the film, the fifth in the blockbuster series, Radcliffe (actual age, 17) has to act out this rite of passage with Katie Leung, 18, who plays Harry's new love interest, Cho Chang. "We shot it for a day," Radcliffe tells me, with a shy smile. "We did about 30 takes. Katie and I were both a bit awkward and nervous at first, but once we got into it, it was fine." The kiss was possibly even more of an event for David Yates, the British director of the latest instalment, and his crew, many of whom have worked with Radcliffe since he was 11. "They were gathered around the monitor and needed to see this moment," Yates says. "They had seen Dan go through all these changes as he's grown up - he is like a son to them, they got quite emotional." If Harry Potter has come a long way as a character, so too has the industry that surrounds Hogwarts' star pupil. Before the latest film finished shooting earlier this year, I visited Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire to talk to Radcliffe and Yates on set. The studio, a former aircraft hangar which was converted into a film facility for the James Bond film GoldenEye 12 years ago, is now the permanent home of Harry Potter. Warner Bros has a further six-year lease on the studios to complete the final two films with Radcliffe. On my visit, I am allowed to wander through the sets - a spectacle in itself. It's no surprise that there is talk of creating a theme park or permanent exhibition out of it all when the series ends. I walk through the atrium to the Ministry of Magic which is modelled after a Victorian Underground station and is where the new film's climactic battle takes place. I pass on to the Hall of Prophecies, the Room of Requirement, Dumbledore's crowded study, and the Court of Justice where we first meet this film's arch nemesis, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton). The detail in each construction is remarkable. Away from the sound stages is Privet Drive, where Harry lives with his aunt and uncle, and a chapel-like building attached to Hogwarts that plays a key part in the drama. Each film employs hundreds of crew members and actors for each 11-month shoot. The budget for the Order of the Phoenix is estimated at &pound;150 million. The prop department is now the biggest in the world, and some of the sets - notably Hogwarts Great Hall - are lifesize constructions which have been used in each film. The massive hall has a floor built of original York stone. The benches and tables in it were distressed to look ancient for the first film. Six years later, they are now genuinely distressed after being used repeatedly by the cast and 320 local schoolchildren, shipped in as extras to play Hogwarts students. Radcliffe has grown up on this set - but still, he tells me, nothing quite prepared him for the demands of the fifth film. "It's not physically challenging like the fourth one, but in terms of the acting it's a lot harder." His first snog is not all he has to cope with: Harry is racked by the guilt he feels over Cedric Diggory's death at the end of the last film, and must come to terms with the death of Sirius Black (played by Gary Oldman), his mentor and godfather, at the hands of evil death-eater Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter). "Doing the real isolation and anger and hurt he feels has been a challenge," Radcliffe admits. "Thankfully I've never been bereaved in my life so I don't know what it's like, but it is incredibly difficult to act the Sirius stuff." Potter Five is a more emotionally complex film than the previous four, and producers David Heyman and David Barron have continued their tradition of enlisting a new director each time the series takes a new turn. Following Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's dark fourth film, Yates, who hasn't made a single feature film, nevertheless brings to the fifth an impressive list of successful, grown-up television work - State of Play, Sex Traffic and The Girl in the Caf&eacute;, all of which attracted critical admiration. His is a name to conjure with among the Hollywood elite, and State of Play - Paul Abbott's edge-of-the-seat political thriller from 2003, which starred Bill Nighy as an editor trying to link two murders - is being remade this summer with Brad Pitt in the lead role and Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland) directing. "That went down particularly well in the States," Yates says. "JJ Abrams [who created Lost] said he was passing episodes around, like a kind of banned substance. It's very flattering." Yates is a far cry from Chris Columbus, who made the first two films: a Hollywood A-list director known for family movies such as Mrs Doubtfire and Home Alone. "The work I've done has a large emotional content," Yates says, " it's very character-driven, and the core part of this fifth book is a very emotional story. Harry Potter has no mum or dad and he clings to this relationship with Sirius Black. So I think what they were looking for when they asked me to do this was to make sure we had a story that felt emotionally rich. It's rawer, edgier, darker and tougher. My contribution will be to grow the films up, as the books are growing up." The ageing process has been a delicate issue all round, but particularly for the young stars of the series, Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (who plays Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), when Warner Bros wanted them to commit to the sixth and seventh films. Radcliffe and Grint reached a deal fairly quickly, but Watson was slow to sign. "Daniel and Rupert seem so sure," she told US magazine Newsweek last year. "I love to perform, but there are so many things I love doing. Maybe that sounds ungrateful. I've been given such an amazing opportunity, but I'll just have to go with the flow." She did finally succumb, for a reported $4 million a film, but not before Grint was quoted as saying that he and Radcliffe were "distant from her now. We don't text or talk to her when we're not filming." JK Rowling has also announced that the final book in the series of seven, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, will be published around the world on 21 July, one week after the fifth film hits cinemas. A major character is going to die, she warns the legion of Potter fans. "I'll go with whatever she writes," Radcliffe says, philosophically. "I think it will be quite exciting if the only way that Voldemort could be killed is if Harry dies as well. There is a very strong connection between them. But I don't know yet. I've had talks with [Rowling] but not about that ..." As to his relationship with the other child actors in the film, Radcliffe is open and polite. "I think when you're thrown together with two people who you haven't known previously and you end up spending the next six years together, you had better get on. We're very lucky that we do." He pauses before adding, "I haven't really seen them outside of the films." Watching Yates directing the three young stars in take after take, there doesn't seem to be any hierarchy or tension among them. Their respective guardians - Radcliffe's father included - crowd around the monitor watching their wards, who cannot perform without an adult relative on set until they reach 18. I wonder what it has been like growing up in a bizarre extended family on one of the most elaborate movie sets in cinema history. "It's something that hasn't really been seen before to this extent," Radcliffe says. "We're a group of kids growing up on-screen. It's sort of an interesting cinematic experiment." Indeed it is. But we'll have to wait until next month to find out how it's progressing. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is released on 12 July.

Its great to see a kid outside hunting instead of sitting in front on the tv or playing dumb computer games. I hope he kills a bigger one next year. Congrats May 31st, 2007 - 15:41:09 I really get annoyed when people who have no knowledge of gun saftey or hunting traditions make ignorant comments. This 11 year old boy was out hunting with the supervision of his father. He was obviously taught at a young age how to properly & safely handle a firearm. He is not going to be the child who causes an accident because of this. What is really dangerous is when an ignorant adult man who has never had training decides that one day he wants to go hunting & then buys a gun that he has no idea how to use & goes out without supervision because it is ok & he is an adult. That's what I am afraid of. Gun saftey starts with education & boys who are interested in hunting should be educated properly & early on. The best education is supervised experience. May 31st, 2007 - 15:46:24 sorry, I was raised to be kind to living creatures. Hunting and killing is a 'tradition' lost on me. There are too many gun toting kids for my taste too. Sue me.

Paula Abdul is the latest celebrity to slate the young Hollywood stars, but in a thinly veiled way which will no doubt save her the scathing defensive words from Lohan and the rest. Speaking to OK! Magazine, the American Idol judge says: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." If anyone needed a role model, I think we may have just found the woman! Abdul goes on to tell about how she suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God. I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years." Not pleasant by anyone's standards. And in case you were wondering why she sometimes looks groggy while on American Idol? "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am! I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain." Young Hollywood don't realise how easy they have it... There are no reader comments.

http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/lohan-returns-to-rehab/2007/05/30/1180205289336.html&cid The Age: national, world, business, entertainment, sport and technology news from Melbourne's leading newspaper. Welcome to The Age. Lohan returns to rehab Lindsay Lohan has gone back into rehab. Lohan drink driving citation Actress Lindsay Lohan has returned to rehab after a weekend drunken-driving arrest, her publicist said on Tuesday, raising questions about whether she can start shooting her latest film as planned. Official word that Lohan was back in treatment came hours after entertainment trade paper said she had just joined the cast of , a comedy starring Shirley MacLaine and set to begin filming this week. "Lindsay admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility on Memorial Day. Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation," the publicist's statement said. No further details were given. But several celebrity news outlets, including TMZ.com and magazine online, said Lohan checked in on Monday to the Promises treatment center in Malibu, the luxury facility where pop star Britney Spears was recently a patient. Lohan, 20, underwent a stint in rehab earlier this year after spending months as an underage regular on the Hollywood party and nightclub circuit. The actress, who shot to fame in Disney films such as , also said in December she had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous for about a year. But her Beverly Hills arrest on Saturday on suspicion of driving under the influence, and police reports that a substance believed to be cocaine was found in the car, triggered a wave of headlines trumpeting Hollywood's latest celebrity relapse. According to TMZ's report, Lohan was admitted to Promises for in-patient treatment, possibly for 30 days, sparking questions about a potential conflict with her new film. Representatives for the film's production company, Still Rolling Prods., and MacLaine, who also is co-producing the film, were not immediately available for comment. But it would not be the first time that Lohan's personal life has put her at odds with demands of her career. Last July, the producer of took the unusual step of going public with a letter to Lohan scolding her for repeatedly showing up late on the set. In his unusual reprimand, the Morgan Creek Prods. executive James Robinson called her behavior "discourteous, irresponsible and unprofessional" and cited her "ongoing all-night heavy partying" as the reason for her tardiness. Lohan returned to work the next day, and , which paired her with film legend Jane Fonda, was released earlier this month. When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

NEW YORK - A pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in âBreakfast at Tiffanyâsâ was auctioned Wednesday for nearly $200,000 â more than six times what the auctioneers expected. The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, sold for $192,000 to a private European buyer at Christieâs sale of film and entertainment memorabilia. The auction house said it had expected the dress to sell for as much as $30,000. âThe sale was filled with iconic pieces,â said Helen Hall, Christieâs head of entertainment memorabilia. âIt captured peopleâs imagination.â Hall said the auction house was pleased with the results of the sale, which brought in $1.2 million. Other items on the block included Marilyn Monroeâs script for âSomethingâs Got To Give,â with the actressâ handwritten notes, which sold for $19,200. A program from President John F. Kennedyâs birthday celebration that featured the actress at Madison Square Garden went for $66,000. All the prices include the Christieâs commission. Â© 2007 The Associated Press.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18950473/&cid Harry Potter theme park set to open - TODAY: Books - MSNBC.com Harry Potter theme park set to open Wizarding World of Harry Potter will open in Orlando in 2009 Harry Potter comes to Orlando theme park May 31: Imagine walking through the Forbidden Forest or Hogwarts Castle? Your dreams can come true when it opens in 2009. Soon you will no longer have to worry about dirtying your robes with soot while traveling the Floo Network, suffering the uncomfortable sensations of apparition or stumbling upon a port key in order to reach the magical world of Harry Potter. Within three years, the only thing youâll have to conjure up is a ticket to Orlando, Fla. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. and Universal Orlando Resort plan to open The Wizarding World of Harry Potter within Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in 2009, Tom Williams, chairman and CEO of Universal Parks and Resorts, announced Thursday on TODAY.Â  The âtheme park within a theme parkâ is the first fully immersive Harry Potter-themed environment based on the best-selling books by J.K. Rowling and the blockbuster feature films. "The plans I've seen look incredibly exciting, and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed," Rowling said in a press release.Â  Williams said Rowling has been collaborating on the park from the beginning and will continue to do so through the opening. Artist's rendering of Hogsmeade village Visitors can stroll about Hogsmeade, discover the mysteries of the Forbidden Forest and explore Hogwarts castle. "(Visitors will) be able to sense the sights, the sound, the touch and the feel, the smells and really immerse themselves in this authentic world," Williams said. Stuart Craig, the Academy-Award winning production designer who has worked on the Harry Potter movies, is leading the creative design on the park to ensure it remains true to the look and feel of the films. âOur primary goal is to make sure this experience is an authentic extension of Harry Potterâs world as it is portrayed in the books and films,â Craig said in a press release.Â  The Wizarding World will feature rides, shops and restaurants all based on the fictional world of Harry Potter. The announcement of the park adds to the current Harry Potter frenzy; the seventh and final book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," will be release on July 21 and the fifth film, "The Order of the Phoenix," opens in theater on July 13.

The Oversight Congress: How Democrats gain Social conservatives bite bullet, back Rudy May 30, 2007 06:35 AM EST The message winked coyly at salivating pop watchers on Monday&rsquo;s episode of &ldquo;The View,&rdquo; as the alphabet unfairly flirted with those of us hoping beyond reason. Rosie was on, being her rosy self, and all seemed right with the delicate &ldquo;big, fat lesbian&rdquo; versus &ldquo;innocent, pure Christian&rdquo; balance of the universe. But, alas, Memorial Day&rsquo;s episode was &ldquo;previously recorded.&rdquo; Damn the technology that brought us the rerun! &ldquo;The View&rdquo; is the best&mdash;the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. But this year has been the super best of all because of Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell, the former comedian/successful talk show host/failed Broadway producer/Democrat/lesbian. With her obligatory male bashing (Bush, Trump and more Bush) O&rsquo;Donnell made &ldquo;The View&rdquo; actually watchable&mdash;something no longer relegated to the ether of TiVo or sneaked through head phones at work when we should be watching CNN. She even made the show CNN-able. With O&rsquo;Donnell the Democrat, Barbara Walters the who-knows-what, Joy Behar the other Democrat and Elisabeth Hasselbeck the super Republican, &ldquo;The View&rdquo; made politics a regular condiment in the morning, almost as good as coffee but with fewer calories. Politics, women, roundtables and not-PBS are virtually unheard of. The show was, for all intents and purposes, kind of groundbreaking this year. But that&rsquo;s all over now since the incident. It all started when O&rsquo;Donnell purportedly compared U.S. troops to terrorists with this quote: &ldquo;655,000 Iraqi civilians are dead. Who are the terrorists?&rdquo; Which, to be fair, is a bit misleading. Either she was accusing America, President Bush, Vice President Cheney or the troops (or maybe even Donald Trump) of being a terrorist&mdash;but someone was being called a terrorist, and in a post-9/11 world that&rsquo;s a dirty word, right? O&rsquo;Donnell implied something vague, which allowed the rest of the world to infer something equally vague. That&rsquo;s when the pundits took to the Internet and accused her of being, at the very least, unpatriotic. &ldquo;When is someone going to sue this liar? She needs to be held accountable for her words,&rdquo; wrote one commenter on the conservative website freerepublic.com. The Media Research Center, a group that tracks liberal bias in the media, has been profiling O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s &ldquo;more noteworthy left-wing outbursts&rdquo; in a &ldquo;report&rdquo; called &ldquo;The Full Rosie.&rdquo; Hasselbeck didn&rsquo;t have her back, says Rosie. TV violence then ensued. From the &ldquo;big fight&rdquo; show: The O&rsquo;Donnell: &ldquo;Do you believe I think our troops are terrorists, Elisabeth? Yes or no?&rdquo; Innocent Elisabeth: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t put suggestions out there that lead people to think things and then not answer my own question.&rdquo; Joy, the voice of reason: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yell at each other, please let&rsquo;s have a conversation,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Why is this personal? There&rsquo;s a war going on out there.&rdquo; Then the terms &ldquo;coward,&rdquo; &ldquo;cowardly,&rdquo; &ldquo;emotions&rdquo; and &ldquo;facts&rdquo; came up. And therein lies the real travesty about O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s rushed departure: why can&rsquo;t women talk about politics without taking it personally? People talk about the lack of female pundits (I have in this paper), one reason being that they don&rsquo;t value &ldquo;chest-thumpery&rdquo; and &ldquo;shouting shows.&rdquo; But last week&rsquo;s episode of &ldquo;The View&rdquo; was just that&mdash;a bunch of chicks shouting at each other (in split-screen time no less) about their hurt feelings. So far, there are more than 9,000 signatures on fireelisabethhasselbeck.com, but according to Tuesday's show&mdash;the first without O&rsquo;Donnell in the moderator&rsquo;s chair&mdash;the two firebrands have &ldquo;started the process of forgiveness.&rdquo; Still, there&rsquo;s a sterling silver lining to this dust-up&mdash;Star Jones-Reynolds is probably out somewhere having a congratulatory double-fudge sundae. read all 102 comments Replies: 102 Viewed: 121 Date: May. 30, 2007 - 7:57 AM EST Well, it looks like they finally got back at Rosie for all the 9/11 talk. Fire her for being too obnoxious and disrupting the show. DO NOT fire her for speaking her mind, even if it's occasionally incoherent in the heat of trash television.

PS Contrary to popular opinion on the left, criticizing the speech of liberals is NOT an oppression of their free speech rights. As much as liberals would like to censor other points of view, silence other voices, free speech means that others get to speak their minds, too.

Who considers Ms. O'Donnel merely a 'Democrat' while soft-spoken Hasselback is a 'Super Republican?'

Americans are dangerously ignorant, quick to judge and slow to think. The idea of American culture leading the world is frightening. Rosie's choice of words may heve been careless--she probably meant something more like 'enemy' ('terrorist' has too much propoganda and emotion attached to it), but her basic point, that we need to look at things from the Iraqi or Middle Eastern point of view, is important.

"Knocked Up," in theaters Friday, was written and directed by Judd Apatow, who was the executive producer of "Freaks and Geeks." In casting his film, he essentially stockpiled actors from the beloved show about two bands of early `80s high school misfits. Seth Rogen (Ken Miller in "Freaks and Geeks") stars in the movie, which also includes Jason Segel (who played Nick Andopolis in "Freaks and Geeks"), Martin Starr (Bill Haverchuck) and a cameo from James Franco (Daniel Desario). To provide just a taste of the deep appreciation fans have for "Freaks and Geeks," it has a 9.5 rating on Imdb.com. That puts it a full 0.4 ahead of the highest-rated film, "The Godfather." "Freaks and Geeks" fans don't just think it was a good TV show, they believe it's one of the greatest achievements in pop culture. (They're right. The breach of journalistic objectivity is, in this case, worth it.) Those who made the show feel similarly. "I'm almost a stalker with it," says Apatow, who also directed "The 40 Year-Old Virgin." "I truly believe those people exist somewhere right now and I don't see them as actors. "The funny thing is for me, I don't even feel like I was part of it anymore when I watch it. I feel a real separation from the work and I can watch it as if it's its own living thing -- and I really like it." The hourlong show -- sometimes called a "dramedy" -- was critically acclaimed and won an Emmy in 2000 for outstanding casting for a comedy series. It was nominated for outstanding writing for a comedy series in 2000 and again in 2001. Nevertheless, NBC canceled it before its first season was over. In 2004, Shout! Factory released a six-disc DVD set of all 18 episodes and with extensive commentaries and special features. "When we realized it was going to end, it was like killing the characters," says Apatow, who also suffered early cancellations of "The Ben Stiller Show" and "Undeclared." "It was our lives." The show's creator, Paul Feig, plays a tiny role in "Knocked Up" too, (look for him among the fantasy baseball players). Since "Freaks and Geeks," he's directed episodes of "The Office," "Arrested Development" and "30 Rock." Perhaps the two biggest stars produced by "Freaks and Geeks" are Franco, who has starred in the "Spider-Man" films, and Linda Cardellini, who is a regular on "ER" as nurse Samantha Taggart. (Busy Philipps, who played Kim Kelly on "Freaks and Geeks," also co-stars on "ER.") Now a director and producer of lucrative summer movies, Apatow says he made "Knocked Up" with the tone of "Freaks and Geeks" in mind: realistic, touching and hysterical. While the critical response for "Knocked Up" has been very positive -- just as it was for "Virgin" -- Apatow says: "I don't think I'll ever make anything as good as `Freaks and Geeks.'" &#169; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://www.actressarchives.com/news.php%3Fid%3D5910&cid Celebrity News - Dress worn by Hepburn sells for $192,000 Dress worn by Hepburn sells for $192,000 BY: Actress Archives | Thursday, May 31, 2007 A dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's that was expected to sell at auction for around $30,000 went for much more, going for $192,000 at an auction this week. The pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the classic film was sold this week at a sale of film and entertainment memorabilia at Christie's in New York. Mania over Audrey Hepburn and especially Breakfast at Tiffany's continues to grow every year. Last year a black Givenchy dress that was worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's caused a frenzy at auction, selling for almost a million dollars. The pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn is in the scene where Holly Golightly learns about her brother's death and smashes her crockery in a fit of grief, according to the BBC. The news service also reports that the now-expensive dress was a late addition to the film. The auction also included a program from the birthday celebration for John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in May of 1962 - the infamous affair where Marilyn Monroe serenaded her favorite president. That program sold for around $66,000. Some items from the estate of Stan Laurel (of Laurel & Hardy fame) sold for around $100,000. Some of the Laurel items included a set of trademark hats, bow ties and a folder full of joke ideas, including the gem, " Rather be pregnant than have tooth pulled? Make up your mind lady, so I'll know which way to tilt the chair. Audrey Hepburn was nominated for best actress for her work in Breakfast at Tiffany's, but lost to Sophia Loren for her work in Two Women. Believe it or not, the legendary Audrey Hepburn only has 30 credits in IMDB. The world-famous actress, who passed away in 1993, is most well-known for her work in Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Funny Face, Love in the Afternoon, The Unforgiven, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Children's Hour, Charade, My Fair Lady, Two For the Road, Wait Until Dark, and Robin and Marian.

William Hurt, left, is the bad-influence alter ego of serial killer Kevin Costner. Pushing coincidence and exaggeration to the point of near comic absurdity, "Mr. Brooks" begins as a steely cool examination of an unlikely serial killer, but it quickly tumbles off that edge into a quagmire of plot gimmicks and writer&#39;s tricks. "Brooks" is the second directing gig by screenwriter Bruce A. Evans ("Stand by Me") from a script he wrote with his longtime partner Raynold Gideon. These two are fine studio writers, but, unleashed from the shackles of the studio development system, they succumb to an urge to explore the dark side of life yet do so without dramatic logic or, for that matter, a moral compass. The film feels sleazy and nasty -- but without the pulp kick of filmmakers who know how to do sleazy and nasty. The two key roles, wallowing in obsession and ambiguity, were superficially juicy enough to attract Kevin Costner (who even produces) and Demi Moore. But they have little to play: The characters are the equivalent of junkies who plunge needles into their veins over and over without the movie giving any reason for the compulsive, self-destructive behavior. Fans might show up at theaters, but such roles are the kind likely to reduce that fan base. As counterprogramming to the summer silly season, this adult thriller might attract a decent turnout for a couple of weeks, after which the film will become a DVD curio. Evans&#39; serial killer, Earl Brooks (Costner), isn&#39;t just an ordinary guy with a secret life but Portland&#39;s Man of the Year in honor of his civic and philanthropic activities. And not just any philanthropist/serial killer but one with his own stalker, a peeping Tom photographer (Dane Cook) who saw him butcher a naked couple having sex, and a daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who comes home from college with a hatchet murder on her resume. Evans&#39; bulldog police detective Tracy Atwood (Moore) isn&#39;t just any ordinary cop but a $60 million heiress who undertakes police work as a hobby. And not just any detective/heiress but one with a nasty divorce that threatens her career and a deranged killer newly escaped from prison who vows revenge against her for putting him away. Now would you believe that Brooks&#39; stalker doesn&#39;t want to turn him into the police but rather wants to go along on his next kill? No? Well, would you believe that the serial killer just happens to spot the deranged killer and his tough-as-nails girlfriend at a convenience store so he can set in motion a plan to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak? Clearly, this is one busy story but one that never digs beneath the surface in search of motives or insight. Brooks has an alter ego named Marshall who is personified by William Hurt. Marshall plays Id to Brooks&#39; weak Superego, always urging him to be bad and enjoy the ride. The two discuss murder methods and the care to take so as to avoid getting caught. But they never really debate the merits of badness. The film views the anti-hero&#39;s compulsion as an addiction. Brooks even attends AA meetings. And when his daughter gives in to her bloody impulses, he figures she has inherited his "disease." This is as far as any insight goes. So all the film&#39;s characters, real or imagined, are either twisted or depraved save for the peripheral roles of wife (Marg Helgenberger) and cop sidekick (Ruben Santiago-Hudson). They aren&#39;t allowed to be very bright, though. One day our Mr. Brooks catches a plane for the Bay Area, performs a hatchet murder to cover up his daughter&#39;s tracks, flies back home and crawls into bed next to his wife. She thinks he has been downstairs the whole time playing with his pottery-making. Right. The filmmaking is sleek and meticulous with well-upholstered sets and insistent mood music. It&#39;s all part of that conceit that a trash exploitation movie done with exquisite production values is somehow classy. It&#39;s not. Eden Rock Media/ElementFilms/Relativity Media/Tig Prods.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Spector defense targets forensic errors By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent Article Launched: 05/31/2007 03:49:20 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge Defense attorney Christopher Plourd places his pen in his mouth to represent a gun entering a mouth, as he cross-examines Dr. Louis Pena, a deputy medical examiner, during the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector, Wednesday, May 30, 2007, at Los Angeles Superior Court in Los Angeles. Investigators made mistakes in evidence collection and handling in actress Lana Clarkson's shooting death, including the loss of a piece of one of her teeth, Pena conceded Wednesday. LOS ANGELES- A coroner testifying in Phil Spector's murder trial acknowledged there were crime lab mistakes in evidence collection and handling including moving Lana Clarkson's body, which ended up compromising evaluation of at least one item at the crime scene. Dr. Louis Pena also said Wednesday during cross-examination by Spector's defense attorneys that medical findings could not determine who held the gun that fired the bullet that killed the actress. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The defense is seeking to show that Clarkson pulled the trigger of the handgun inserted in her mouth. "Let's get it very basic," defense attorney Christopher Plourd said Wednesday. "You can't tell who was holding the gun." "That's correct," Pena replied. Pena said Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as "pending" until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didn't necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. "There are two ways to look at it," said Pena. "It implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity." On Tuesday, Pena was unequivocal that Clarkson's death was a homicide. He testified there was no evidence Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. He said she had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. He said Wednesday he didn't consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. The medical examiner also said criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarkson's teeth. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coroner's office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarkson's dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised investigators' ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. Pena acknowledged during cross-examination that Clarkson's body was mistakenly moved, causing blood to flow from her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the "Wall of Sound" recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Corman's 1985 cult film "Barbarian Queen." The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

The second sequel in the Walt Disney-made series has already broken box office records in the US for the best Memorial Day weekend debut, after making $142.1m (105.8m).

He was 76. Reilly died Friday in Los Angeles of complications from pneumonia, his partner, Patrick Hughes, told the New York Times. Reilly began his career in New York City, taking acting classes at a studio with Steve McQueen, Geraldine Page and Hal Holbrook. In 1962, he appeared on Broadway as Bud Frump in the original Broadway production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. The role won him a Tony Award. He was nominated for a Tony again for playing Cornelius in In 1997 he received another nomination for directing Julie Harris and Charles Durning in a revival of After moving to Hollywood in the 1960s he appeared as the nervous Claymore Gregg on TV's The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and as a featured guest on The Dean Martin Show. He gained fame by becoming what he described as a "game show fixture" in the 1970s and 80s. He was a regular on programs like often wearing giant glasses and loud suits with ascots. His larger-than-life persona and affinity for double-entendres also landed him on the with Johnny Carson more than 95 times. Reilly ruefully admitted his wild game show appearances adversely affected his acting career. "You can't do anything else once you do game shows," he told The Advocate, the national gay magazine, in 2001. "You have no career." His final work was an autobiographical one-man show, Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly, about his family life growing up in the Bronx. The title grew out of the fact that when he would act out as a child, his mother would often admonish him to "save it for the stage." The stage show was made into the 2006 feature film called The Life of Reilly. Reilly's openly gay television persona was ahead of its time, and sometimes stood in his way. He recalled a network executive telling him "they don't let queers on television." Hughes, his only immediate survivor, said Reilly had been ill for more than a year. No memorial plans had been announced. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Dr. Louis Pena also said Wednesday during cross-examination by Spector's defense attorneys that medical findings could not determine who held the gun that fired the bullet that killed the actress. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The defense is seeking to show that Clarkson pulled the trigger of the handgun inserted in her mouth. "Let's get it very basic," defense attorney Christopher Plourd said Wednesday. "You can't tell who was holding the gun." "That's correct," Pena replied. Pena said Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as "pending" until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didn't necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. "There are two ways to look at it," said Pena. "It implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity." On Tuesday, Pena was unequivocal that Clarkson's death was a homicide. He testified there was no evidence Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. He said she had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. He said Wednesday he didn't consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. The medical examiner also said criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarkson's teeth. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coroner's office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarkson's dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised investigators' ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. Pena acknowledged during cross-examination that Clarkson's body was mistakenly moved, causing blood to flow from her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the "Wall of Sound" recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Corman's 1985 cult film "Barbarian Queen." Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The attraction will include thrill rides, specialized foods, experience-based 'textural' features and more. Following is a partial transcript (possibly video later) of the live webcast issued exclusively to fan sites tonight which detailed the announcement: for even larger versions of the artist renderings below.) Hi, I'm Scott Trowbridge, vice president of creative for Universal Studios Theme Parks. We're here in Dumbledore's Office set at Leavesden Studios, a very special place, to make a very special announcement today. over what we're about to share, but because you folks are the dedicated Harry Potter fans, it was important for us to speak with you first and personally about this exciting news. There's a lot happening right now in the world of Harry Potter. The final book is due out this summer, the fifth movie is also coming in July, and we, with our partners at Warner Bros., have been working on a very exciting project of our own. And I'm very excited to tell you folks first that we are adding a new dimension to the world of Harry Potter and bringing it to life in an entirely new way. Stuart Craig (SC), production designer for all the films, is introduced. We actually have over 20 artists and designers working here at Leavesden, who've been working on this project with Stuart and his team, to bring that level of authenticity to bear on this project. We've had other help as well. Steve Kloves, who is the screenwriter for many of the films; David Heyman and David Barron, two of the producers, have been a great support in helping us bring this to life in a truly authentic way. And of course, JK Rowling herself has review our plans from the very beginning and has given us her encouragement and support, has been a great collaborator. Now, this theme park within a park is not just a place. It will be a place to provide an opportunity to experience the magical world of Harry Potter first hand, and offers guests the chance to visit some of the wizarding world's most famous locations. This includes the village of Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest, even the crown jewel itself, Hogwarts castle. Authenticity is something that's very important to us. In terms of both the theme park and just the world of Harry Potter in general, why do you think the authenticity and credibility is so important? SC: Well, the philosophy on the movies was to make everything seem as real and credible as possible. We undertook a period of research, and looked at the great European cathedrals, Oxford University in this country. We shot in those places, but we also built sets, and we're sitting in Dumbledore's Office right now, which is a reflection of that. So all of this kind of informed us and helped us to keep the world credible, to keep the detail very real and very specific. That same philosophy was applied to the theme park. What we're talking about here is a fully immersive and engaging environment, with lots of ways to discover this world for yourselves for the first time. SC: The movie people, this team of 20 artists, illustrators, draftsmen and so on, they know how to deliver the details. Universal's expertise is obviously in generating theme parks and being able to manage the enormous numbers of guests and how to make them safe and how to make them enjoy the whole experience. But more than that, I think there's a particular kind of American skill, American virtue. I think theme parks are American, and I think America has a way of just embracing an idea, really going for it, giving everybody enough and then a little bit more -- 110%. That kind of collaboration and our two sets of very different skills are making this work in a very exciting way. ST: What we are collaborating on is coming out to be an incredibly exciting project. Now, of course we're talking about the environment, but that's not all that's part of this world. It will be an amazing, immersive, rich and detail filled environment, but there's also going to be amazing rides and attractions, experience-based shows, shops and restaurants, and we'll be bringing out for the first time ever, a spectacular new attraction that will bring the magic and characters and stories of Harry Potter to life in a way never before experienced, capturing the heart and imagination of all of our guests. SC: I'm scared to death and then I'm enjoying it at the same time. I think even making a movie delivers concerns as well as fulfillment. I'm enjoying our collaboration enormously. There's a lot of challenges. A lot of times on films, we get caught up in what it looks like, what the camera sees, but less so on what does it feel like, what does it smell like, is it hot, is it cold, those kinds of textural things that we'll be providing in the world that we're building. ST: Unfortunately we're not quite ready to give out all the details behind the magic yet. We have a long way to go to finish the design on this project, but we'll be providing more information as we go. SC (on why the story and characters are so powerful): Its reach around the world is phenomenal, and what is really intriguing is that the books and the movies are very very specific in its European culture and British institutions, what we call public schools and what the rest of the world calls private or boarding schools. The manners and the behaviors and so on, very very specifically British. The architectural detail is so geographically specific. So the fact that the world is able to find this accessible and relate to it and get pleasure from reading it is extraordinary, and a tribute to its great great power. The Americanization of world culture, older European cultures often complain about. This is the antithesis of that. This is America embracing a very specific European culture and making it really accessible, taking it to the world. It's enormously powerful, surprisingly so. ST: We try to give people experiences they can't get anywhere else. This world of Harry Potter will be a place where fans can have a real personal encounter with the magical world. You can discover it on your own, and on your own terms. That's really one of the things that Universal really strives to do. This park is going to be at Universal Orlando Resort. Our heritage is in the movies and in creating one-of-a-kind experiences. In Orlando, there are actually two Universal theme parks: there's Universal Studios, which is based on film and television, and right next door is Islands of Adventure, which will become the home of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. At its soul, it's about great stories of literature, great stories of adventure. We feel it's a perfect home for the WWoHP. Islands of Adventure was lucky enough last year to be awarded the Best Theme Park in the World ("applause award"). ST (to SC): What are you looking forward to, when the doors open and you see people coming into the park for the first time? SC: I'm looking forward to being one of them. I want to go there! I want to take my grandchildren. I think this unique collaboration of the theme park world and movie world will be magical and I can't wait to be the first in the gate. ST: The Magical World of Harry Potter is scheduled to open in early 2010. As I said before, we're going to keep you informed as we move ahead. Visit for web and e-mail updates. Q: Will I be able to going inside Hogwarts castle? A: You will, says Stuart. You'll be able to see the exterior of Hogwarts castle and then enter it. It's a magical space, so it's kind of limitless on the insides. But there are certain key elements, very familiar elements, maybe even this environment we're sitting in now, you will indeed be able to go into. Q: What is JK Rowling's involvement? A: JK Rowling has been involved from the very beginning, and I mean from the beginning. We wouldn't be doing any of this if these great, fantastic stories hadn't been born from her imagination. Specifically on the theme park project, she has from the very beginning, reviewed our plans, and been very supportive and excited and encouraging about what we're doing. Q: Shouldn't the theme park be in England? A: (SC) I think Orlando is the focus of theme parks. Everybody's very used to gravitating there, and listen, the climate's much better there. It's perfectly natural. I think it's absolutely appropriate. The bottom line is I think you'll do it better there than we'd do it here anyway. Q: Will the new environment be based on any specific book or film? A: It's intended to encompass the entire world of HP. People are going to be coming to the park at different points in their relationship with the books and the movies, so we want to create a world that feels right no matter where they are in their relationships with the books or films. It's not based on any specific point in time. It's really based more on the DNA of the archetypal Harry Potter book and experience. Q: Has this been held until after book 7 so that it could be built completely, or is the timing of a coincidence? A: The timing is more coincidence than not. We have been working with Warner Bros. and with JK Rowling for a number of years now, and we've actually already been in design for at least a year and a half. We will be taking elements from all of the books, and eventually all of the films. The WWoHP is expected to open just before the last film opens, so we're going to try to take as much material that represents the world and make it a part of this physical embodiment. Q: Are there any thrill rides in the theme park, such as rollercoasters, dedicated to any of the characters? A: Yes, there will be thrill rides, there will be very intense thrill rides, there will be immersive, engaging rides that are filled with story and fantasy, and there will be lots of opportunity for people to get different entertainment experiences that are based on characters. SC: I think it's very important that the theme park represents the entire saga, from book 1 to book 7. It needs to feel complete, and it will feel complete. Q: Can fans contribute ideas to the park? A: Yes, we do want this to be a dialogue with you. There will be an opportunity for us to hear back from you. We won't be able to accommodate and incorporate everybody's ideas, but we do want to hear from people. Q: What age range will the park be aimed at? A: This is Harry Potter. It deals with the magic, but it's not fairie, pixie-dust kind of magic. This is a more mature kind of magic. This is a set of stories that deals with real struggle and good and evil. SC: I'd say it begins around 7 and goes to my age and even up to 67. Q: What steps will be taken to ensure that the park will still feel British even though it is in Florida? A: We are undertaking this project in a way unlike any other project we've taken on before. That includes everything from the way we're building it. We're having it drawn and designed by people with experience not only in Harry Potter but in that British sensibility that Stuart talked about. We're going to continue that thinking all the way through the food that we serve, the merchandise that we sell, the way we train the employees and staff, will all be done with that eye towards authenticity, and an eye towards our commitment to making this world as authentic and incredible and as 'Harry Potter' as it possibly can be. SC on his favorite planned part: We're sitting in one of them, fortunately, and this is one we'd very much like to create within the theme park. There are corners of the Common Room that I like very much, there are aspects of the Dark Arts classroom I like very much, the silhouette of the entire castle. In Hogsmeade, too, we have never shown the complete Hogsmeade in the movies and there's a chance here to do so. I think those new elements the theme park will have that the movies haven't been able to explore, that's exciting too. ST: We think that the Harry Potter world is already a classic. It is a modern classic and will have a life well beyond when the seventh book is printed and when the seventh film is in the can. We're making the commitment to building this place where that world will live on for many, many, many years. We look forward to this being a place where you can bring your family, your grandson, your friends, time and time again, and kind of share it with them. Hopefully it will be a place that will appeal to everyone.

I can imagine myself on my late twenties going to Hogwarts an Hogsmeade XD! Posted May 31, 2007 at 4:20 AM EST This sounds ok, I was a bit concerned at first incase it turned out to be a bit 'tacky' but it seems like it will be done really well - doubt I'll go though because I'm terrified of flying!! :( Posted May 31, 2007 at 4:24 AM EST That is so amazingly cool!

Very dissappointed though that seeing this is an English based film that they can't do something in England. We are just terrible at theme parks but I do think that if they had an HP theme park here thousands would come here to visit. Posted May 31, 2007 at 4:38 AM EST Oh... my..... GOD!! That is so fantastic - if they can pull it off, it would be an amazing theme park. Imagine being able to go into a real Three Broomsticks pub and get a jug of butterbeer..... oh this would be worth the cost to fly to the USA! I hope it's not 'cheesey' - sounds too good to be true. Great report!

Reilly's partner told The New York Times that he died Friday in Los Angeles of complications from pneumonia. Reilly was 76. Reilly won a Tony Award in 1962 for playing Bud Frump in the original Broadway production of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." He gained fame by becoming what he described as a "game show fixture." He was a regular on programs such as "Match Game" and "Hollywood Squares," often wearing giant glasses and colorful suits with ascots. Reilly's larger-than-life persona and affinity for double-entendres also landed him on the "Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson more than 95 times. . All rights reserved.

After writing and directing 2005's and producing Will Ferrell's , the man now has scores of films he's either writing, directing and/or producing coming soon. A recent profile dubbed him the "Mayor of Comedy." It's possible that Apatow is being over-praised, but based on what he's pulled off with , it's getting harder to make that argument. Somehow, a two-hour-and-10-minute comedy with an idea as old as time (loser impregnates a one-night stand and grows up!) has managed to be the funniest film of 2007. Aside from that, he's pulled off some casting coups: He's not only written a large and hilarious part for his real-life wife, Leslie Mann, but he's cast his young daughters, Iris and Maude, in smaller parts&mdash;and hilarious. Hell, he even gets a funny performance out of Ryan Seacrest. The man is good. takes a standard comic premise and makes it both sweet and incredibly dirty. Apatow regular Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a pudgy layabout whose lifestyle consists of getting high with his roommates and working on a Web site designed to catalog nude scenes in movies, an idea even conservative audience members will realize has already been done. Ben hooks up with career-oriented entertainment reporter Alison Scott, played by Katherine Heigl (much better here than on TV's ), and a miscommunication about birth control leads to the titular pregnancy. Alison is just as unprepared for a baby as Ben&mdash;her perpetually irate sister (Mann), with whom she lives, met her equally unsatisfied husband ( 's Paul Rudd) under similar circumstances. Meanwhile, her superiors at the television station (Alan Tudyk and Kristen Wiig) have let her know that "We don't want you to lose weight, we just want you to be healthy. By eating less." The film more or less follows the expected formula: Ben and Alison decide, a little too quickly, to be a couple for the sake of the baby, leading to many scenes of arguments, trips to the gynecologist, and a hysterical bit where a swollen, hormone-crazed Alison has trouble finding the right sexual position with a terrified Ben. The story is just self-aware enough to seem slightly embarrassed by how predetermined its beats are, and there are times when it fast-forwards over such bits as Ben finally starting to get it together. That said, the inevitable labor scene has a priceless sight gag that too many trailers and other reviews have spoiled. However, the plot is not as important as the film's relaxed, natural voice and performances. Like Steve Carell in , Rogen becomes an unlikely leading man, and there's fantastic work from all the actors&mdash;Rudd has a hilarious scene involving hotel chairs. Even small roles, such as 's Craig Robinson as a depressed bouncer, make a memorable impression. It's also nice to see Harold Ramis get a good part as Ben's supportive-but-clueless father: He and Rogen have a great, relaxed chemistry. (His few minutes of screen time are funnier than the last three films he's directed.) It looks like we're due for a slew of more films from Apatow and Rogen, starting with the Rogen-scripted teen comedy later this summer, and then next year's , directed by one-time North Carolinian David Gordon Green. As Apatow is producing both films, we may be witnessing the dawn of the Apatow-Rogen age of film comedy. If any of these new films are as funny as , then this will be a fine epoch indeed. &mdash; Kevin Costner, still dancing with wolves after all these years Photo by Ben Glass/ Element Funding Kevin Costner's enduring popularity is a fascinating phenomenon. He is the regular butt of jokes revolving around infamous cinematic duds. Yet, at age 52 he remains a steady, bankable actor who, like Gary Cooper before him, subsists off an earnest everyman accessibility that many find comforting and endearing. No one should ever accuse Costner of being a great thespian, but whether atop a horse or a pitcher's mound, he is always Kevin Costner. Thus the allure of a film like , in which the perennially nice guy actor aims to reveal a dark side, &aacute; la Jimmy Stewart in or Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West , for example. As the titular Earl Brooks, Costner plays a successful family man so nondescript he owns a box-making factory and reigns as Man of the Year for the Portland (Ore.) Chamber of Commerce. He exudes perpetual calm, even when his daughter (Danielle Panabaker) reveals her withdrawal from college and illegitimate pregnancy, and is so exact he does not employ contractions when he speaks. Brooks also happens to be a pathological serial murderer known as the Thumbprint Killer, who has taken more lives for longer than he can remember or the film bothers to inform. Operating out of a work studio that doubles as a kind of macabre Batcave, Brooks sheds his mild-mannered alter ego and targets random prey for his nocturnal hunts, goaded by an ever-present imaginary devil on his shoulder named Marshall (William Hurt, in full-bloom bravura). Brooks comes off a two-year hiatus to ventilate an attractive dance couple, but a rare slipup results in his illicit secret being uncovered by a daft amateur photographer, referred to only as Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). Smith in turn proposes an unusual blackmail: As consideration for his silence, the two will partner so Brooks can impart killing expertise to his new apprentice. Never does the film realize its delirious intent more than when wallowing in the machinations of Brooks' murderous delectation. In its purest form, , both fables about conformists whose primordial impulses burst their societal moorings in dramatic and disturbing fashion. Brooks' motives are irrelevant and indeed more frightening in their ambiguity. We are not unnerved by the bloodlust as much as the unremarkable, even appealing visage of its vessel, a predator that violates our conditioned demographic biases. It is all the more disheartening, then, that this potentially compelling character study becomes hijacked by some infuriating subplotting. Brooks' predilection suddenly morphs from an addiction he tries to suppress with the help of support groups&mdash;no doubt sans the essential step of admitting his wrongs to others&mdash;into a genetic trait he might have passed to his daughter. And then there is Tracy Atwood, a police detective hot on Brooks' heels, played by Demi Moore with a Lifetime movie-of-the-week countenance. The careers of screenwriting duo Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans (who also directs) span the good ( ), the bad ( ) and the downright ugly (Tim Allen's ). To their credit, they emerge from a 10-year stint in movie jail with this ambitious concept. But oh, for this material to be in the hands of a director like Christopher Nolan and his skill in atmospheric dissections of fractured psyches. Intriguing yet flawed, deserves better treatment, as does a leading man willing to muss his clean-cut image. But don't cry for Costner&mdash;there is always another cowboy movie just over the horizon. &mdash; It's easy to get cynical about any film involving high school sports. Inspirational sports flicks rarely stray from their cookie-cutter protocols and have become fantastically cheesy and predictable over the years (thank you, ). But director Davis Guggenheim's ( is not a typical high school sports melodrama, even if the flaxen-haired main character kicking a soccer ball on the film's poster makes it seem so. Set in a smoggy 1978 New Jersey landscape, tells the story of a young girl who sets out to play varsity soccer on an all-male team during a time when girls' sports rarely strayed from the arena of cheerleading, ice skating and field hockey. Motivated by the untimely death of her older brother, Gracie defies the odds and proves to her soccer-playing father and brothers that she is indeed tough enough to make the team. After a series of tumultuous 6 a.m. runs, shin-splints, bruises and beat-downs take a toll on her young body, she makes the final cut and joins the ranks of the boys' soccer team. Fortunately, the sports movie clich&eacute;s only make up half of Guggenheim's film. The other half is an insightful drama about family, grief and coming-of-age. Inspired by true events from the lives of the Shue family (actress Elisabeth Shue&mdash;Guggenheim's wife&mdash;acts in and produces the film alongside her brother Andrew), the film's true inspiration blooms from within the strained relationship between Gracie and her grief-stricken father (Dermot Mulroney). As Gracie rebels against her family (her acting out consists of failing history, making out with college boys and smoking cigarettes while listening to Blondie), her father slowly becomes her homing beacon, leading her toward her goal of joining the boys' varsity team by training her both day and night. Although the film veers toward predictable sports sentimentality at times, it is the intimate portrait of a father's acceptance of his daughter that gives emotional force to and its main font of inspiration. &mdash; 0 comments posted for this article There are no comments yet for this story.

The total boxoffice for the 109 films tracked by The Hollywood Reporter was $255.3 million -- marking the biggest weekend in boxoffice history. Early estimates for the weekend overall were slightly higher than what the actual turned out to be as most observers pegged the total for the four-day frame nearer the $265 million level. The new boxoffice benchmark was a mild 2% higher than the industry's previous biggest-grossing session of $249.3 million, which occurred during a rare five-day post-Christmas/New Year's weekend running from Dec. 28, 2001-Jan. 1, 2002, when the holiday fell on a Tuesday. New Line Cinema's "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" was the top film with $57 million. The next-largest weekend was the four-day Memorial Day session in 2004 with $247.6 million, when "Shrek 2" topped the charts with $95.6 million and 20th Century Fox's "The Day After Tomorrow" debuted with $85.8 million in second place. This year's holiday weekend gross was up 6% from last year's Memorial Day tally of $241.8 million. As expected, by weekend's end, "At World's End" was sitting in the top spot at the boxoffice in North America, making port with a four-day holiday gross of $139.8 million. Including the $13.2 million from Thursday night previews that began at 8 p.m., the total to date for the latest "Pirates" yarn from the Walt Disney Co. is a massive $153 million. The opening weekend for the Johnny Depp starrer will go down as the second-biggest opening weekend of all time, behind the $151.1 million bow of "Spider-Man 3" and ahead of the $135.6 million debut of "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest." Both "Spider-Man 3" and the "Dead Man's Chest" opened during a nonholiday three-day weekend. Director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and writers Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott worked on all three "Pirates" films in the same capacity. The PG-13 adventure, co-starring Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush, opened in a record 4,362 venues and should hold up pretty nicely in the weeks ahead if exit polls are any indication. According to CinemaScore, a sterling 90% of those polled gave "At World's End" a positive score. The high seas-set picture hit all four quadrants in the demographic world -- which is every film's dream demo -- and the percentage comparison between the quadrants was divided fairly evenly. The combined high score and wide demo reach should give "At World's End" some legs at the boxoffice. "Shrek the Third" was in the second spot with $67 million from 4,172 locations. The not-so-jolly green ogre held up well in its sophomore frame and has collected a stout $217.4 million in 11 days. The PG comedy has the animated audience pretty much to itself for at least one more weekend, and then Sony's CG-animated "Surf's Up" hits theaters June 8. "Spider-Man 3" took in $18.1 million to snag the third slot in its fourth weekend in theaters. The Tobey Maguire starrer is still swinging strongly at the boxoffice, generating a noteworthy $307.8 million during its first 25 days in release. Lionsgate's "Bug" was the weekend's only other wide release. In a counterprogramming move, the R-rated thriller debuted in 1,661 locales and placed fourth with a $4 million gross, averaging a weak $2,408 per theater. William Friedkin directed "Bug," based on the off-Broadway play by Tracy Letts. Word-of-mouth doesn't seem likely to help this picture in the weeks ahead as the film was rated favorably in exit polls by a dismal 19% of moviegoers, according to CinemaScore. A bright spot among limited releases was Fox Searchlight's "Waitress," which jumped into the fifth slot with $4 million. The comedy was in 501 theaters, up 394 from the previous weekend, and averaged $7,984 per theater. Its cume stands at $6.5 million.

LOS ANGELES - A coroner testifying in Phil Spectorâs murder trial acknowledged there were crime lab mistakes in evidence collection and handling including moving Lana Clarksonâs body, which ended up compromising evaluation of at least one item at the crime scene. Dr. Louis Pena also said Wednesday during cross-examination by Spectorâs defense attorneys that medical findings could not determine who held the gun that fired the bullet that killed the actress. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The defense is seeking to show that Clarkson pulled the trigger of the handgun inserted in her mouth. âLetâs get it very basic,â defense attorney Christopher Plourd said Wednesday. âYou canât tell who was holding the gun.â Robyn Beck / AP Dr. Louis Pena, a deputy medical examiner, testifies during cross-examination in the Spector murder trial. âThatâs correct,â Pena replied. Pena said Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as âpendingâ until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didnât necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. âThere are two ways to look at it,â said Pena. âIt implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity.â On Tuesday, Pena was unequivocal that Clarksonâs death was a homicide. He testified there was no evidence Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. He said she had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. He said Wednesday he didnât consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. The week in celebrity sightings Fergie does New York, a new âIdolâ is crowned, âOceanâs 13â comes to Cannes, and more. The medical examiner also said criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarksonâs teeth. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coronerâs office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarksonâs dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised investigatorsâ ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. Click for related content Coroner says it was homicide Criminalist Leeâs credibility under attack Pena acknowledged during cross-examination that Clarksonâs body was mistakenly moved, causing blood to flow from her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the âWall of Soundâ recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Cormanâs 1985 cult film âBarbarian Queen.â Â© 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

BY: Actress Archives | Wednesday, May 30, 2007 making headlines for her car crash in Los Angeles over the Memorial Day weekend, one of Hollywood's worst-kept secrets may be headed under the microscope. Underage movie stars seem to have no problems making the rounds at trendy nightclubs on the SunsetStrip and Hollywood Boulevard, but are they being served alcohol? More to the point, after was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, was served alcohol illegally before her now-infamous car crash? The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has placed investigators in various nightclubs to try and determine the answer to that question. In the case of , the paparazzi has video showing Lohan leaving the Les Deux Hollywood nightclub at around 3:30am before she crashed her car. In the state of California, the legal drinking age is 21 and alcohol cannot be served after 2 a.m. However, Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore told the had dinner and was not drinking. A statement quoted by the Because of the enormous paparazzi presence outside of Les Deux that night, we allowed her to stay late and wait for her friends. , the 20-year-old star who turns legal age on July 2, was driving her Mercedes-Benz convertible when she hit a curb and crashed into a shrub on Sunset Boulevard. was taken to a nearby hospital in a private car, while the two other passengers in the Mercedes were not hurt. Police later said that they found " a usable amount of cocaine " in the car, and later arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. Since then, a publicist for has said the actress has entered the Promises rehab facility, the same one which recently attended, on Monday. John Carr, a spokesperson for the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) told the We have a duty to check on these things whenever there's a report of a minor involved in a crash. " Carr also noted that " underage drinking is a huge problem in the state of California. " To support that claim, some statistics claim that 1,574 people were killed in alcohol-related vehicle crashes in 2006, with roughly 200 involved in underage drinking. But the question still remains: Are underage celebrities getting a free pass to drink in Hollywood? Last year, the paparazzi were on the scene at the Mood night club, where various underage stars were seen. Along with and Jesse McCartney were all seen at the nightclub, and all were underage at the time. One photograph showed Jesse McCartney, who was 18 at the time, drinking from a Corona bottle at Mood. However, John Carr told the that, ",eM>We can't prove what's in the glass or where they were. We need a witness on the ground. " The ABC is currently seeking a 15-closure of Mood based on an undercover investigation. John Carr did say that there is no current investigation into Les Deux following the car crash involving , but he did tell the We do investigate any time we get complaints when someone underage is being served. Anyone under the age of 21 cannot be sold alcohol in California.

PHOTOS: Ms. USA Booed, Falls at Pageant PHOTOS: Beauty Queens Play Dress Up The boos started as soon as Smith stepped forward for the interview round. And it continued, along with chants of "Mexico," as Smith launched into a history of her volunteer work in South Africa. "I don't think they are booing because of Rachel," said Donald Trump, co-owner of the Miss Universe pageant. "They are booing because of the immigration policy." The tensions were evident in 2004 and '05, when Mexicans booed during the national anthem at a soccer game against the United States, some even chanting "Osama." Resentment has grown since then, as the United States sent the National Guard to help beef up border security and build a wall to keep immigrants out. Many Mexicans are also anxious about the new immigration bill which they fear would split Mexican parents from their American-born children. "People in Mexico get a flavor of that debate and it's irking them, and I think what occurred is indicative of what happened in the manner and tone of Congress in the debate," said Nativo Lopez, president of the Mexican American Political Association. Some Mexicans feel that the United States uses its power to get its way in world politics and also in competitions such as the Miss Universe pageant, Lopez said. They were upset that Miss Mexico didn't make it to the final five and Miss USA did, even though she slipped and fell during the evening gown competition. Smith has not commented on the story. It was a tough night overall for Miss USA: She failed to capture the crown after falling. However, Smith is being credited for grace under fire during the boos, which she managed to partly turn into cheers by addressing the crowd in Spanish.

He said the animal measured more than 9 feet from tail to snout. The story immediately was met with skepticism. Jamison said he bagged the boar on a hunting preserve in eastern Alabama. The publicity prompted his father, Mike Stone, to create a Web site that features photos of the boy and his trophy, dubbed Monster Pig. It's also earned Jamison a bit part in an upcoming film "The Legend of Hogzilla," based on the tale of a superpig gunned down in Georgia in 2004. Hog Hoax: 1000 Pound Monster Pig 'Hogzilla 2' Skull Revealed by Boy With fame, however, comes criticism. The Stones have been accused of everything from doctoring photos to make the pig look bigger to unnecessarily torturing an animal. "We've gotten a lot of negative e-mail," Mike Stone told ABC News.com. "People have said they want to see my boy killed in a hunting accident and gutted like a pig." Now he has the swine's skull and some backup from a taxidermist. "Jerry (Cunningham), the taxidermist, brought me this bleached skull of my hog and this is a 1,051-pound hog skull and that's a ... 250-pound hog skull," the boy said, pointing to the skull of a smaller animal, placed next to his monster's hog for comparison. Cunningham agreed with Jamison on the size of the boar. "I actually skinned this pig out," Cunningham said. "And I know it was a 1,000-pound hog. It was that big. No doubt." Skull photos are here. Don't expect them to quiet the skepticism. The skull looks way smaller than the massive head in the photos.

YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SEE Knocked Up more than once, just so as not to miss any of the priceless jokes. The writer and director, Judd Apatow, whose string of television cult favorites included The Larry Sanders Show and Freaks and Geeks, has a remarkable flair for dirty frat-boy banter and sardonic one-liners. As in his 2005 film directing debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the plot of Knocked Up is merely a peg for a Gatling-gun barrage of wisecracks. Knocked Up reprises the profane sensibility and much of the cast of 40-Year-Old Virgin. Seth Rogan, a sidekick in Virgin, plays a stoned slacker named, appropriately, Ben Stone, who stumbles into a drunken one-night stand with statuesque blonde Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), an aspiring E! Entertainment TV correspondent. Alison, a bit of a slacker herself, lives with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann, Apatow&#39;s wife), her feckless husband Pete (Paul Rudd) and their two little girls. In their inebriated sexual frenzy, the couple forgets birth control, and Alison soon discovers she&#39;s pregnant. In the cold light of day, Alison realizes Ben was one of those "how drunk was I?" one-night stands: paunchy and puerile, he lives with his stoner buddies in a messy, bong-hazy house with neon beer-sign d&eacute;cor. He&#39;s an impossibly bad candidate for a relationship, let alone fatherhood. He&#39;s never held a job, and lives off a settlement he got when a mail truck ran over his foot in his native Canada. Ben and his friends insist they are working: They&#39;re building a Web site that will direct users to the "boobs and bush" scenes in DVD movies, dumbly unaware that the Mr. Skin Web site already performs this important service. So much for the business plan! The story is told from Alison&#39;s and Ben&#39;s perspectives, with a surprising measure of sympathy. For a movie as savagely jokey as this, the writing has unexpected depth and shading. Alison, after taking dozens of pregnancy tests hoping for a different outcome, decides to have the baby, then has to hide her growing girth (and occasional on-air morning sickness) from her appearance-obsessed bosses. Despite Ben&#39;s unsuitability, Alison decides they should try to make the relationship work, with predictably rocky results. Yet there is hope, because beneath his lazy, immature exterior, Ben is actually a pretty nice guy. Rogan&#39;s comedic talent enables him to find the balance between repulsiveness and likeability. He also has a wonderful way with a one-liner; the quips roll out of his mouth with exquisite timing. When Ben&#39;s dad, played by an uncredited Harold Ramis, tells Ben he&#39;s the best thing that ever happened to him, Ben thinks a moment and says, "Now I just feel bad for you." Alison relies on the advice of her sister, who has troubles of her own with a husband who refuses to grow up. Pete makes Ben his confidant, sharing with him his dark thoughts about family life &mdash; his fear that he will never be as happy as his little daughters are at play. Rudd and Mann are terrifically funny as the couple in crisis. Like the Steve Carrell character in Virgin, Ben receives lots of useless advice from his buddies. When one housemate declares abortion a sin, another concocts a mock euphemism: "Okay, rhymes with shmashmorshun." There are more memorable jokes in this movie than in Virgin (which Apatow co-wrote with Carrell), and more, in fact, than in any recent movie I can think of. The movie is longer than it needs to be, and at times loses its way in gynecological slapstick, gross humor and unfortunate baby-related sentimentality. But unless you are offended by vulgar jokes and explicit sexual humor, it&#39;s easy enough to ignore the flaws and just laugh. &copy; 2007 The Cleveland Free Times: 800 W.

The total value of the deal is $400 million, including $370 million in cash and debt of $30 million, according to a source familiar with the talks. Famous Music's catalogue of over 125,000 songs and sound cues includes music by Eminem and Shakira as well as movie soundtracks from Famous was founded originally as a unit to publish songs from movies. The deal is the first major move by recently appointed SonyATV Chief Executive Martin Bandier, the former head of EMI Music Publishing who left EMI earlier this year. As part of the deal, SonyATV will be entering the production music business through the Famous Extreme division. SonyATV is jointly owned by Sony and pop star Michael Jackson. Its catalogue includes songs by The Beatles, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix. "The depth and breadth of the catalogue is what truly makes it great," said Bandier. Music publishing has become one of the more coveted segments of the music industry as recorded music has been severely hit by piracy and the transition from physical sales to digital music files. Publishing is less vulnerable to the vagaries of music retailing as it generates revenue by licensing songs to a variety of sources, including television, advertising, radio and live performance. Earlier this month, French media giant Vivendi's Universal Music Publishing Group unit became the world's largest music publisher after it bought BMG Music Publishing in a $2.19 billion deal. Other music companies have also said they intend to expand their publishing catalogues.

Add to My AOL Silver Surfer Quarters Are Not Legal Currency Posted May 29th 2007 4:33PM by It seems I no longer need to worry -- or rant -- about the American government selling itself out for ad space. The Silver Surfer quarters that I on Friday were not actually made with any cooperation from the U.S. Mint*. In fact, a press release from the Mint states the coins are "in no way approved, authorized, endorsed or sponsored by the United States Mint, nor is [the movie promotion] associated or affiliated with the United States Mint." According to a spokesperson from 20th Century Fox, neither the studio nor the Franklin Mint meant to imply the U.S. Mint was involved, and certainly neither meant to break the law. But the marketing stunt may in fact be in violation, because it is illegal to turn federal money into an advertisement. This appears to be exactly what Fox and Franklin have done, since the 40,000 Silver Surfer coins are modified versions of actual U.S. quarters originally minted and circulated by the government in 2005. It is hard to understand exactly how Fox and Franklin think the promotion, which advertises the website for the movie Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer , did not imply the coins are real, legal tender. Though the Franklin Mint often produces collectible and commemorative coins, it does not usually distribute them for free by dumping them into circulation. The Silver Surfer quarters were sent into the currency stream last week and all are expected to be in circulation by the end of the Memorial Day weekend. If neither Fox nor Franklin means for them to be accepted as real money, then how are they to be distributed? So far neither company has been issued a fine or other legal ramification, but we'll see if something more happens with the story once the business week begins. *Thanks to commenter Alex C. for tipping me off about the follow-up story.

If I'm not mistaken, it's still legal tender. The Franklin Mint just painted the image of the Silver Surfer over the back of existing 2005 California state quarters. It's defaced legal tender, but it's still legal tender. I think. on May 29th 2007 by Fred Philbie 2. I guess you are correct, Fred. I can't find anything stating if defacement of currency makes it no longer legal tender. I did find the law regarding defacement as a crime, however: Defacement of currency is a violation of Title 18, Section 333 of the United States Code. Under this provision, currency defacement is generally defined as follows: Whoever mutilates, cuts, disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued, shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. on May 29th 2007 by Christopher Campbell Please keep your comments relevant to this blog entry.

Griffin offers explanation for Rosie departure BY: Actress Archives | Monday, May 28, 2007 Kathy Griffin, a close friend of , has come forward to reveal why the host of The View has officially left the show and won't be completing the final three weeks of her contract. Yes, it does have to do with 's on-screen fight with , but that's only half the story. According to Kathy Griffin, as reported by People magazine, her friend was furious that the producers of The View decided to turn her honest disagreement with into something sensational by split-screening the two hosts of The View during their fight. Kathy Griffin tells the magazine that she spoke to right after the announcement from ABC Television that she wouldn't be returning to The View, " I said, 'What was it really?' 'The split-screen. I don't want to do "Hannity and Colmes."' Kathy Griffin has filled in twice for in the past few weeks and spoke about the departure of her friend to a sold out crowd at the Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. According to TMZ, Kathy Griffin also claimed that doesn't even feel that much hatred for heard that Donald Trump had called "stupid," she apparently expressed sadness. According to Kathy Griffin, " She doesn't even hate Elisabeth. It all started on Wednesday when , two hosts of The View who have never seen eye to eye, got into their most protracted and intense fight in the history of the show in front of the world. The fight was started because of the differing opinions of the war in Iraq between , but the two very different hosts have feuded really since Rosie got to the program. It got ugly on Wednesday's edition of The View, when expressed the opinion that " the enemy is in Iraq. then jumped into the fray as she pointed out, " You just said our enemy is in Iraq...Did Iraq attack us? " As the heated exchange went on, The View producers split the screen with one side focusing on and the other zoomed in on , who is married to New York Giants back-up quarterback Tim Hasselbeck and is the sister-in-law of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, used a football analogy to explain her point of view. " If you're playing a game and I say I'm throwing to my receiver wide right, okay what does that do for your enemy Rosie? " Rosie shot back, " Well Elisabeth, if the enemy are innocent civilians, I don't want to play that kind of football. It got worse from there with Joy Behar trying to settle down and the controversial host clearly becoming exasperated with the whole situation. Referring to how much time she had left on the program, That's why I'm not going to right with you anymore because it's absurd, so for three weeks you can say all the Republican crap you want. It wasn't over, even as Sherri Shepherd tried to cut to commercial and Joy Behar tried to calm , who shouted out, " I asked you if you believe what the Republican pundits were saying. You said nothing and that was cowardly. wasn't happy at all with that, saying, " Dont call me a coward. I sit here every day and open my heart and tell people exactly what I believe...It was not cowardly. It was honest...asking a rhetorical question? That is cowardly. I need a drink of water, lets go to commercial. The View needs hosts. With gone for good and about to go on maternity leave, the program, which is more popular than ever, is going to have to find interesting characters to replace them. As of right now, Joy Behar is the only person officially coming back to The View. was only on The View for less than a year, but it helped the show by getting it all kinds of new press from the host's high profile fights with Donald Trump and to her comments on the Catholic Church and the attacks of 9/11. Whatever people think of , she will be tough to replace on The View. Elisabeth Hasselbeck in the News Are Rosie and Hasselbeck speaking again?

Gay Vote: Best of Broadway: Musical Trivia quiz: Broadway broads Trivia quiz: Best Broadway quotes Trivia quiz: Broadway musicals An interview with the puppets from "Avenue Q" by Alonso Duralde, The Advocate Tony Award-winning actor and television personality Charles Nelson Reilly died May 25, 2007 , at the age of 76. In this October 9, 2001 interview, the pop culture oddball and theater director opens up to The Advocate. The name Charles Nelson Reilly may inspire eye-rolling over memories of the poncy, pipe-smoking '70s game-show guest -- but he may well be one of pop culture's most misunderstood figures. After all, Reilly is considered by many -- including his close friends Julie Harris and Roberta Peters -- to be one of his generation's best theater directors. He won a Tony award in 1962 for originating the role of Bud Frump in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." His students have included Lily Tomlin, Bette Midler, and, currently, opera sensation Rodney Gilfry. And, one might argue, his television ubiquity as a flamboyantly gay man in the supermacho '70s counts as a quiet form of revolution. "Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis are activists; they're the first ones to march down the street," says Reilly in the dining room of the plant- and memorabilia-filled Beverly Hills home he shares with his partner, Patrick Hughes. "But I'm more like Marian Anderson, who was a great singer and never said a word about the fact that she was black -- but [being] a black woman in a gorgeous gown and very good jewelry, accompanied by a man on a Steinway in Carnegie Hall, was her way of doing it." Reilly's way of doing it brings him to his latest work, "Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly," which opens off-Broadway at New York's Irish Repertory Theatre on October 7 following several successful regional runs, with an eye toward Broadway. It's an interesting journey back for the 70-year-old actor-director, a staple of such musicals as "Bye Bye Birdie" (he understudied for Gene Rayburn, who would later play straight man as Reilly unleashed his comic barbs on "Match Game"), "Skyscraper," "Hello, Dolly!" and "How to Succeed." Reilly says he left musical theater "because the plays were directed by Gower Champion, Michael Kidd and Michael Bennett -- and they were very wonderful, but they all were boy dancers who went to being choreographers who went to being directors. So you say one line like 'There she goes,' and then [there are] 12 minutes of a big number. I had a big speech by Thornton Wilder in 'Dolly,' and we were in dress rehearsals and I start the speech, and I got two or three lines out and, 'OK, that's all! Stop!' Miss [Carol] Channing could make the costume change in three lines, so they didn't need the rest. I got tired of being a Rockette; I went to Hollywood." In Hollywood, Reilly made a name for himself as the devious Claymore Gregg on the TV version of "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" -- the character had been scripted only for the pilot, but Reilly was such a hit that he became a regular -- and as part of the comic relief on "Dean Martin Presents the Golddiggers." Gen Xers remember him camping it up on Saturday mornings on Sid and Marty Krofft's surrealistic pillow "Lidsville" and on the short-lived, ahead-of-its-time "Uncle Croc's Block" (a show so barely remembered that even Reilly gives me an odd look when I bring it up). But the appearances that seared him into the public consciousness came on game shows, particularly "Match Game '73," "'74," "'75," et al. His banter with perpetual co-panelist Brett Somers gave the show a last-call-at-the-Algonquin feel, and Rayburn could always get Reilly to lower his voice to a butch register by calling him "Chuck." That part of his career, according to Reilly, has been something of a hindrance in television. "You can't do anything else once you do game shows," he notes. "You have no career." Of course, Reilly has had the "no career" that most actors would kill for: Playing novelist Jose Chung on Chris Carter's The "X-Files" and "Millennium," he racked up an Emmy nomination in 1998 for the latter show (although the actor is still miffed that the character got killed off) and another for a 1999 appearance on "The Drew Carey Show." And his volume of work as a theater director is nothing short of astounding -- in fact, it almost appears that Reilly is doing a one-man show of his own life simply because he's already done everyone else's. "I've done Emily Dickinson ["The Belle of Amherst"] and Oscar Levant and Paul Robeson ... I did one with Richard Basehart as Patton," says Reilly. "And Ruby Dee said the words that made me want to do it: 'While you're still perpendicular.'" "Save It for the Stage" goes back to the actor's childhood in the '30s, when he was being raised by a difficult -- to say the very least -- mother and already exhibiting the qualities by which he would become known later in life. "Here comes Mary," Reilly recalls the neighborhood kids yelling when it was his turn at bat in stickball. The show follows his lifelong love of show business, the close friends he's made along the way ("Miss Harris" and Burt Reynolds are probably mentioned the most), and amazing stories, like that of the NBC president who told a young Reilly that there could be "no queers on television" -- only to be found dead years later, murdered by a male prostitute. "I never made my sexual orientation a part of my life," says Reilly. "It didn't matter. I think so many people make it overly important, and I think that's when they get in trouble. That wonderful Toni Morrison, who I think is so brilliant, she helps me every time she talks on television. They used to call her Â¿nigger' and spit on her, and she felt sorry for them. She said they have no morality. When that man told me they don't allow queers on television, I felt sorry for him. I don't know how I knew that." Today, he seems very happy with Hughes, his partner of 20 years. "He's my life," says Reilly. "And we courted for 20 minutes. He worked for a game show called Battlestars, and he was the producer's associate, so he would help the celebrities to their dressing room. The smile was the thing -- his laugh. I love Patrick, and Patrick and I are completely different. We have never had a fight or raised voices. We should not be together, because we have nothing in common. Absolutely nothing, but Â¿ I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for him. He is extraordinary. He has 800 plants, hanging here, hanging there. And he does it 10 minutes a week; it's kind of strange. But that's Patrick." And while his home life is stable, Reilly finds that "Save It for the Stage" (which he developed with "Time Flies When You're Alive" creator Paul Linke) is always changing. "It's strange -- nightclub slash legitimate theater slash platform piece," he says. "I don't know what it is. It's sort of telling us what it is." But for the natural-born storyteller, performing the play isn't that far removed from his daily life. "I tell the stories all the time," he says. "I go out to dinner, and I'm always with six people, and nobody speaks. So I'll start with a story. Actually, doing the play for two hours is easier than being out, because Ilb talking anyway. At least I get paid for it." Letter to the Editor &copy; 1995-2007 PlanetOut Inc | Save name and password

On his second day as prosecution witness, Deputy Coroner Louis Pena reasserted the jury that the death was a homicide. When cross questioned by defense lawyer, Pena reaffirmed that presence of gun residue on the victimâs hand does not necessarily mean that she shot herself. He even explained how gun residue could drop on a person when heâs being shot by somebody, by putting his hands around his face and chest. "There are two ways to look at it. It implies the person could have been holding the weapon or been in the vicinity when the weapon was discharged," Pena said. He also told the defense lawyer that even the person who has the gun in hand may not have traces of gun powder after the shot. The prosecution witness disclosed that after examining Clarksonâs body he discovered bruises on her tongue, her right arm and hand which brings out a possibility that she was being threatened with a gun in her mouth and was under the pressure of her murderer. When cross questioned by the defense lawyer about the possibility of the presence of the bruise on the tongue due to the gunshot, the doctor answered that such occurrence was ânot normally seenâ. He also added that there was no way to confirm how fresh the bruises were considering the fact that Lana took a lot of pain medications. He also said that while collecting evidence they found large amount of Clarksonâs blood in the left pocket of Spectorâs pants which suggests that the gun had been placed in the pocket and was also wiped. Being asked to analyze the entire situation, Pena disclosed that he had a different picture of Clarkson in mind. All that he could gather from various sources about her is that she was a hopeful person and had no records of suicide attempts or depression. He also added that a suicide with purse on one shoulder at a strangerâs place was a rare possibility and it is a simple case of murder. "It bothered me a lot that she had her purse on her right shoulder," Pena said yesterday. "It's difficult for someone to take a weapon and shoot herself with the purse staying on her shoulder. It should be off." Defense attorney Christopher Plourd also asked him if there was a possibility that the handbag stayed on her shoulder due to a self inflicted wound. Pena confirmed the possibility but added that the circumstantial and physical analysis made him reach the conclusion that the death was a homicide. The defense attorney tried to shoot down the witnesses stand by saying that it was only once in the court that the forensic expert mentioned the significance of the purse and it was not mentioned anywhere in his reports or notes to which the doctor agreed but insisted that he mentioned it in a meeting once before. When asked about any mistakes that Penaâs team made during the investigation, he answered that one of his dental investigators lost one of Clarksonâs teeth which was kept in a vial. Pena was given a taped vial, which seemed to have been assembled after breakage and wasnât told about the incident for several months. "There were three vials collected to be examined by the odontologist," Pena said. "What happened is on review in meeting with the odontologist he admitted he broke one of the vials and the tooth fragment was lost. It flew around the room somewhere." He also told the jury that the dental investigator sealed the vial again but the fragment was never found. He also conceded that Clarksonâs body was moved in a wrong manner which caused blood to flow out of her mouth making it difficult to evaluate her dress for blood spatter. Forensic expert Henry Lee, was also under the doubt umbrella as a retired sheriff's investigator who worked for Spector's initial attorney told the court he saw Lee hold a piece of fingernail in a handkerchief at the time of inspection of the scene in an earlier hearing. The prosecutor confirmed the incident by showing the jury a photograph of the actressâs bloodstained right hand, which showed that part of her acrylic thumbnail was missing. According to prosecution this finding directly pointed towards a rift that must have happened between Spector and Lana before the killing. They also hinted that the defense hid the evidence to save their case. The defense lawyer cross questioned the doctor all morning and also asked a lot of questions on defense experts Vincent DiMaio and Werner Spitz, whose textbook Pena was consulting during the investigation. The testimony will resume tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Harvey Phillip Spector, 67, is accused of shooting actress Lana Clarkson, 40, through the mouth on 03 February 2003 early morning in his mansion. Spector who is presently free on $1-million bail, on the other hand claims that Lana committed suicide. Spector, 67, the American musician songwriter and record producer will face 15 years of life imprisonment if convicted of murder. Actress Lana Clarkson was famous for her notable performance in the movie Barbarian Queen. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Rapper Taboo Pleads... &raquo; Officials Investigate if Lohan Was Served Drinks Illegally California officials are investigating whether there is any evidence Lindsay Lohan was illegally served alcohol before she was arrested for driving under the influence on Saturday. The 20-year-old, who police picked up after she crashed her Mercedes in Beverly Hills, is under the state's legal drinking age of 21. Before her accident, Lohan was spotted partying at the West Hollywood nightclub Les Deux. TMZ.com claims to have video footage of the actress leaving the venue at around 3:30 am on Saturday morning -- an hour and a half after closing time. John Carr, a spokesperson for California's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, has confirmed his agency is investigating whether there is evidence Lohan and other youths were served alcohol illegally, and whether they were served drinks after hours. Les Deux has issued the following statement: "We have and will continue to work closely with the ABC to make sure alcohol is consumed by responsible people of the legal drinking age, in a responsible manner. "Les Deux is a restaurant and there is no age limit for our patrons. Lindsay had dinner at Les Deux that night and waited for friends to pack up the DJ supplies, thus leaving Les Deux after closing. "Because of the enormous paparazzi presence outside of Les Deux that night, we allowed her to stay late and wait for her friends. She was not drinking at Les Deux, and left driven by her driver." Lohan checked into the Promises clinic in Malibu on Monday. Earlier this year, she received treatment at the Wonderland Center rehab facility in Hollywood. DUH - she and others have been alowed in and to drink forever! The law is just as guilty as the clubs for not upholding the law! Posted By: SoozeeQ | May 30 2007 at 03:03 PM That's what I'm thinking too. NOW you want to find out where this minor has been getting wasted? Posted By: Cranky_Old_Batt | May 30 2007 at 03:09 PM Guess she'll have to migrate to Vegas like Britney - or try Tijuana between trips to rehab. Posted By: itsaspork | May 30 2007 at 03:15 PM If she left driven by her driver, how did she crash the car? Or was that a different incident of all-night partying? Posted By: hawaiian | May 30 2007 at 03:19 PM I wonder how long until the spin doctors blame Blowhans behavior on these clubs. Posted By: Good_Karma | May 30 2007 at 03:19 PM If they served her directly I can see the problem. But in an all ages club/restaurant, is the establishment liable if patrons who are of age buy alcohol and THEY then furnish it to minors? Posted By: FrankCostanza | May 30 2007 at 03:23 PM Was she served drinks illegally? Posted By: trait | May 30 2007 at 03:26 PM I agree with you guys on this one. What took them so long to investigate the clubs that serve this girl? Hey Lindsay, when I was underage and going to college in Milwaukee, WI, I could go drinking at ANY bar there was. They never check in Milw. It's BREW TOWN for Godsakes! You can go there for the next few days until your 21st b-day. Posted By: DirtySanchez | May 30 2007 at 03:27 PM Would love to know what her blood alcohol level was! Posted By: LizardofOz | May 30 2007 at 03:35 PM I am shocked that she may have been served drinks illegally. I now have to take to my bed to recover. Posted By: snarkygirl | May 30 2007 at 03:36 PM These places want the attention of these worthless divas so does that mean that they have to go to rehab too? Posted By: nettie67 | May 30 2007 at 03:45 PM I wonder what all this PR can do for Les Idiots. Posted By: itsaspork | May 30 2007 at 03:53 PM This is really a non-issue...Lindsay Loser is a grown woman...everybody needs to stop "babying" her...she made these choices...if she can get "illegal" drugs...who the hell is gonna stop her from getting some liquor if she wants it?...let's "stop" all this bullsh!t...stop pointing the finger at everyone except the one u all need to be pointing the finger at...Lindsay Loser...ain't no need to he harrasing these business establishments...this investigation is a copout...deal with the "real" problem...Lindsay Lohan!!! Posted By: bmorejake | May 30 2007 at 04:16 PM If I was ARNOLD, and want to live in the White House someday, I would be all over this, like a tramp on her good intentions!! Posted By: tigerz | May 30 2007 at 04:17 PM ok I was drinkin @ 18 at the finer SF establishments example: Savoy Tivoli, Gold Mirror, Philly's Club (west portal), Danny's (RIP), Miraloma Club, Portal, TK's, Shannon Arms, GPS (Glen Park Station), Eagle's Drift, Peaks, Yancy's, of course Noe's, Abby Tavern, and Ireland 32's (when there was a line to get in..) ha I have also hit the LA cat n' fiddle, Wall st to name a few..... Posted By: xbbgun | May 30 2007 at 04:36 PM What a relief to hear law enforcement is ON it! Years after Drew Barrymore was partying at the age of 6. Posted By: blasphemusrumrs | May 30 2007 at 04:43 PM it's about friggin' time, and i ask again, what is MADD doing about this? Or is MADD too scared to step on the wrong toes by demonstrating outside of Les Deux, or any of these hoity-toity clubs? Another thing, have they determined what the drug that wasn't "found on her person" is yet, or have they swept that under the rug? Posted By: azdog1 | May 30 2007 at 05:43 PM Oh my xbbgun, you are bringing me back. I used to frequent Gold Mirror, Shannon Arms, Eagle's Drift, Yancy's and Ireland 32's quite a bit. I'll never forget my years in the Mission where my roomate and I did what we called "The Triangle" nearly every night for a year. We went to The Albion and then on to the Kilowatt and finally we would stumble to the 500 Club. Those were the days. Are those bars still there? Posted By: DirtySanchez | May 30 2007 at 05:47 PM It's not like everyone on the planet doesn't know she's under age. Posted By: Redbull | May 30 2007 at 06:11 PM It's the clubs, the producers, directors, her friends, her family...everyone is at fault but Lohan. Posted By: lil_night_owl | May 30 2007 at 06:19 PM I never got carded when I was in high school and before I turned 21, going to Savoy Tivoli etc (fun times). The difference is that it wasn't all over the papers that my 21st birthday was coming up and I don't think the bartenders had any reason to card me. Lindsay is a slightly different story - they really can't plead ignorance of who she is and how old she is. Posted By: madhousewife | May 30 2007 at 06:27 PM Of course she was served illegally, she admitted as much a few weeks back when she said she couldn't wait for her 21st so that she didn't have to put the clubs in an awkward position because she was underage. However, I agree bmorejake, we can't just blame the clubs 'cos the little hussy will find a way to get what she wants. It just disgusts me that this slapper is unfortunately a role model for young girls. I know she shouldn't be but try finding a teenage girl who hasn't heard of Lindsay Lohan.... She is showing young girls who think she's all that, that drinking, taking drugs, driving drunk and recklessly, sleeping with anything with three legs, and smoking is a cool way to behave. I just cannot express my distaste for her strongly enough.... Posted By: Kazzer | May 30 2007 at 07:23 PM Albion is now called Delirium. Other than that all the bars are still there, though IMO a bit hipster except for Kilowatt. Posted By: Rosemarg | May 30 2007 at 07:55 PM Lilo...the closet gay thing won't go away w/substance abuse. Ask Whitney. Posted By: slacker | May 30 2007 at 10:00 PM Gritted teeth! I agree with Bmorejake! Posted By: Lilahjane | May 31 2007 at 01:02 AM What about her mother?? Or is she too busy being drunk someplace else? I'll give Brit's mom some credit, at least she tries, and seems to have learned enough to keep the younger sister out of all that. WTF kind of skank mother goes out drinking w/her teen age daughter? Posted By: pinkblonde | May 31 2007 at 04:00 AM If bringing the legal drinking age down to 18 or even 16, back to where it had been for so long, would mean there'd be even one less "scandalous crime" to report in this or any media outlet (god, can this sorta news actually be called "media"..or "news"?) it would be well worth it.

Gough NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - The "American Idol" finale drove Fox to a primetime ratings win for the week ended Sunday, the last day of the 2006/07 season, according to Nielsen Media Research. ABC was first out of the gate last week with Monday's "Dancing With the Stars" (20.2 million viewers, 5.3 rating/15 share in adults 18-49) and the finale of "The Bachelor: An Officer and a Gentleman" (12.7 million, 4.8/12). But NBC's "Heroes" (13.5 million, 6.2/15) coming out ahead of both in the key demo. Fox's "24" concluded its season with a sub-par 10.3 million, 3.8/10. The penultimate episode of "Idol" (25.3 million, 9.7/27) gave Fox the win in adults 18-49 Tuesday, but a poor showing by the premiere of Fox's Steven Spielberg reality series "On the Lot" (7.6 million, 3.6/9) allowed ABC to win in viewership thanks to the "Dancing" finale (23 million, 6.7/17). Fox again proved victorious Wednesday with the two-hour-plus finale of "Idol" (30.7 million, 11.5/31), which competed for an hour against ABC's two-hour season finale of "Lost" (13.9 million, 5.9/15). Thursday saw the premiere of "So You Think You Can Dance" (9.5 million, 3.7/12), which helped Fox win the night in 18-49 despite a second poor showing from "On the Lot" (5.2 million, 2.1/6). But CBS won in viewership with a night of repeats highlighted by "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (13.8 million, 4.1/12), which even beat "Dance" in the demo. ABC and CBS split Friday, with CBS winning in viewership and ABC in the demo thanks to "National Bingo Night" (5.5 million, 1.8/6) and "20/20" (5.8 million, 1.6/6). CBS won Saturday in viewers with two hours of "48 Hours Mystery" (5.5 million, 1.2/4 and 7.1 million, 2.0/7), while Fox won the demo. Sunday was a day and night of racing, with ABC's Indianapolis 500 averaging 6.4 million viewers and a 1.9 in 18-49, while Fox's running of NASCAR's 600 in primetime averaged 7.5 million viewers and a 2.7 rating in the demo. It was the seventh consecutive year that the 600 topped the 500. For the week, Fox averaged 11.6 million viewers and a 4.4/14 in the demo, followed by CBS (9 million, 2.2/7), ABC (8.9 million, 3.0/9), NBC (5.5 million, 1.9/6) and the CW network (2 million, 0.8/2). &copy; Reuters 2007.

The Franklin Mint/Fox co-promoted Silver Surfer quarters, aimed at promoting the Fantastic Four sequel, aren't legal tender, according to the U.S. Mint. The Mint said late last week that it had told Franklin Mint that it was breaking the law because it's illegal to turn U.S. currency into an advertising vehicle, according to Newsarama. "The promotion is in no way approved, authorized, endorsed, or sponsored by the United States Mint, nor is it in any way associated or affiliated with the United States Mint," the feds wrote. The US Mint did not say whether the studio or The Franklin Mint would face a penalty. Both Fox and Franklin Mint said it was not their intention to break the law. However, according to the original release and contest information, the coins were to be placed into the currency streams across the United States, allowing them to fall into the hands of individuals who would visit the website and enter the contest, according to Newsarama. The Franklin Mint stated: "This legal tender coin is a 2005 California statehood commemorative quarter minted by the United States Mint and specially color-enhanced by The Franklin Mint for Twentieth Century Fox."

Click me to Who should fill Rosie's seat? Rosie O'Donnell on "The View." Photograph by : ABC Erin Carlson, Associated Press Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 Now that Rosie O'Donnell has exited stage left, must find someone to fill her seat and somehow match her watercooler appeal. That won't be easy, but there's a lineup of famous ladies who could make worthy successors. The brash, big-hearted O'Donnell brought edge and excitement to , lifting ratings and making enemies along the way. But in a move out of line with her fighting persona, she chose to depart the ABC talk show earlier than planned following an on-air confrontation with co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck. There's no disputing the star wattage and/or entertainment value of possible replacements Roseanne Barr, Whoopi Goldberg and Bette Midler. Other names that have come up are former talk show host Ricki Lake, comedians Kathy Griffin and Wanda Sykes, Oprah Winfrey's best friend Gayle King and genial actress Sherri Shepherd. No possible contender is buzzier than Barr, who has said she wants the job. Griffin, whose acid-tongued bark is equal to her bite, would be another good choice, said magazine executive editor Dan Wakeford. "She's very similar to Rosie in a lot of ways," Wakeford said. "She elicits strong reactions like Rosie. Love her or hate her, you have a reaction which makes great TV." In that respect, Griffin â who put it ALL out there on her Bravo reality show â certainly delivers. But ... can she deliver viewers? "After dealing with Rosie for a year, Barbara and the producers may prefer someone who's easier to manage and less dramatic," noted Wakefield, who said the less controversial Shepherd is popular with the show's producers. Still, he said, "the most important thing is ratings." Pop culture critic Ken Tucker is skeptical such hopefuls can match O'Donnell's TV talents: humor, controversy and "an ability to keep the show moving." The chatfest needs to "look for a different personality" post-Rosie, Tucker said. He has an idea: Make co-host Joy Behar the moderator and hire the spunky Sykes as a panelist to replace Star Jones (who either quit or was fired last year, depending on whom you believe). The likeable Behar, who has an eternal expression of bemusement, has "really come into her own in the past few months since Rosie's been on," said Tucker, editor-at-large for Entertainment Weekly magazine. "She is somebody who could be the moderator and the kind of voice of reason to keep things going when everybody starts talking over each other." Behar illustrated that talent when she attempted to distract O'Donnell and Hasselbeck during last week's infamous spat, saying: "Who is directing the show? Let's go to a commercial." Tucker's other favorite is Lauren Graham, who formerly starred on TV's . The brunette beauty is "really smart," he said, and has been out of work â hey now! â since the mother-daughter dramedy closed this year. As long as we're on the subject, there are others who should get a look. For your consideration: â¢ Marie Osmond: The wholesome singer and sister of Donny is now an outspoken mother of eight. She was a surprisingly self-assured and appealing guest co-host a few weeks ago â despite her religious upbringing, no "hot topic" seemed off limits. Osmond, who's got loads of life experience and is divorcing her second husband, could be an unexpected foil for the girlish Hasselbeck. â¢ Sharon Osbourne: The wife of Ozzie and mother of three has battled colon cancer, managed her husband's music career and earned TV experience on America's Got Talent, The Osbournes and her own talk show. â¢ Kelly Ripa: The adorable sidekick to Regis Philbin has juggled multiple TV gigs at once. What's one more? â¢ Mo'Nique: The hilarious host of VH1's tells it like it is. But she's charismatic enough to get her own talk show â without co-hosts. Can O'Donnell be equaled? Show creator Walters seems to think so. "We've been a hot show for 10 years," she proclaimed Tuesday on her show, "and we'll be a hot show for many years."

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/05/30/ap3772267.html&cid Low Ratings Underscore NBC Changes - Forbes.com Low Ratings Underscore NBC Changes 05.30.07, 7:14 PM ET Numbingly low Nielsen ratings for last week made it clear why NBC this week hired a new team to oversee its prime-time entertainment department. The once-proud Peacock network averaged only 5.6 million viewers last week, less than half of prime-time leader Fox. Since 1991, NBC has had only two weeks with fewer viewers, and they were both during network TV's summer slumber. NBC Universal announced Tuesday that it was firing entertainment chief Kevin Reilly. The team of successful producer Ben Silverman and financial man Marc Graboff is assuming authority over all NBC programming. The network that once boasted of its "must-see TV" saw most of its Thursday lineup last week - "Scrubs," "30 Rock," "The Office" and "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip" - attract fewer viewers than Univision's telenovela, "Destilando Amor." The one exception was "My Name is Earl," which had 90,000 more viewers than Univision's Thursday hit. NBC burned off an original episode of its much-touted and now dead Aaron Sorkin drama, "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip," Thursday to less than four million viewers. Last week was dominated by the finales of "American Idol" (30.7 million viewers) and "Dancing With the Stars" (23 million) - numbers the broadcast networks won't likely see again until the fall winds blow. For the week, Fox averaged 11.6 million viewers (6.9 rating, 12 share), ) had 9 million (6.0, 11), ABC had 8.9 million (5.8, 10), NBC had 5.6 million (3.7, 7), the CW had 2 million (1.3, 2), My Network TV had 910,000 (0.6, 1) and ION Television had 670,000 (0.4, 1). Among the Spanish language networks, Univision averaged 3.7 million viewers (2.0, 3), Telemundo had 1 million (0.6, 1), TeleFutura had 570,000 (0.3, 1) and Azteca had 310,000 (0.1, 0). ABC's "World News" increased its winning streak in the evening-news ratings to five weeks, its longest since 1996. It averaged 7.8 million viewers (5.5 rating, 12 share), NBC's "Nightly News" had 7.2 million (5.2, 11) and the "CBS Evening News" had 6 million (4.2, 9). A ratings point represents 1,114,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's estimated 111.4 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. For the week of May 21-27, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships: "American Idol" (Wednesday), Fox, 30.74 million; "American Idol (Tuesday), Fox, 25.33 million; "Dancing With the Stars Results (Tuesday), ABC, 22.96 million; "Dancing With the Stars" (Monday), ABC, 20.19 million; "NCIS," CBS, 14.14 million; "Lost," ABC, 13.86 million; "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," CBS, 13.79 million; "Heroes," NBC, 13.48 million; Movie: "Jesse Stone Sea Change," CBS, 13.01 million; "The Bachelor," ABC, 12.67 million.

But perhaps you donât have the energy it takes to lift a paperback â and hey, itâs understandable. Some of those bigger tomes on quality paper can be pretty heavy! Donât worry, to savor âThe Starter Wifeâ (8 p.m. Thursday, USA Network), an enjoyable chick-lit concoction, you donât have to lift anything heavier than your TV remote. This mini-series, which airs for two hours Thursday and has additional episodes on Thursdays in June, is adapted from Gigi Levangie Grazerâs novel of the same name. As adapted by USA, itâs the TV equivalent to a satisfying, entirely inconsequential beach read. You know the kind of book I mean â the one in which you get to secretly revel in the brand names and luxe lifestyle of the heroine and her friends yet still enjoy the satisfaction of condemning them (just a little) for their frivolous, materialistic lives. The fact that the arrogant, unappreciative men in the book get roughed up (metaphorically speaking) is just an added bonus. And of course, aside from the Thoughtless Man, there are always one or two Other Guys, who are Not Mean and maybe Better Than That Jerk the heroine made the mistake of committing her life to. Debra Messing (âWill & Graceâ) plays Molly Kagan, who has spent a decade as the perfect Hollywood wife. Sheâs well-groomed, well-read and runs her husband Kennyâs domestic realm with a firm, efficient hand. Itâs not long, though, before he dumps her, by phone (âI want a divorce. Iâm at the Peninsula.â). Soon sheâs borrowing a friendâs beachside house in Malibu (oh, to have such friends!), while she regroups and contemplates the fact that the entire Hollywood community is shunning her â she keeps showing up to the ârightâ parties and embarrassing everyone. From being married to a mogul for so long, she knows the rules of the Tinseltown community â sheâs supposed to fade away politely. But she canât quite bring herself to do that. She canât quite believe that the country club would cancel her membership without warning and that sheâd be a non-person at all the good restaurants so quickly. Oh, the indignity of no longer getting the best table at the âinâ sushi place! Yes, in the real world, such things are of no consequence, but Messing has the perfect set of skills to make this piffle go down as easily as an ice-cream sundae: As Molly, sheâs hurt, angry and funny in just the right amounts. When her husband starts dating a teeny-bopper pop singer, you not only want to smack the guy but give her a hug. âStarter Wifeâ ticks along at the clip of a woman scanning the sale racks at Barneys; itâs efficient without being too hasty. And as Mollyâs posse of friends, Miranda Otto, Chris Diamantopoulos and especially the wonderfully waspish Judy Davis are an engaging bunch. Joe Mantegna is warm yet enigmatic as a media mogul who takes an interest in Molly, but thereâs also that random surfer dude she keeps seeing on the Malibu beach. Is he a mega-rich mogul who can afford to bum around all day? An out-of-work actor who has nothing better to do than hang out with his dog? Or perhaps heâs that most rare of creatures (in Malibu, anyway) â a regular person. These are the mysteries that the frothy âStarter Wifeâ plumbs. Itâs not deep. But, really, do you deep this time of year? It's nice to see Debra Messing on TV again. I really enjoyed her "Wedding Date." And am looking forward to this one also. After a day of work and taking care of family and home, I like to be entertained. There's enough reality on the 6pm news, a little whimsy does a soul good. And Debra does whimsy very well. She is funny, talented and to laugh before sleep is a good thing! | May 30, 2007 1:18:46 PM I'll pass. I don't think Debra Messing is that great of an actress but seems to play the role of victim very well. Posted by: | May 30, 2007 5:12:33 PM I just read the book, and it was both funny and charming. I'm looking forward to the movie, although the previews demonstrate that it diverts from the book quite a bit. That's par for the course, I guess! Interestingly, in the book the main character's name was Gracie and her best gay friend's name was Will. I could see how, with Debra Messing as the lead, they'd want to change the character's name to Molly, so as not to have "Will and Gracie." :) Posted by: Kristin | May 30, 2007 6:22:55 PM Ugh. I'll pass too. Debra Messing does loud and goofy well, but that's about all. She's a baaaad Lucille Ball knock-off. | May 31, 2007 7:17:41 AM Judy Davis is in it? | May 31, 2007 8:51:50 AM Comments are not posted immediately.

Faces and voices made famous on "American Idol." A Finale To Remember Performances by Gwen Stefani, Bette Midler and Smokey Robinson made this "American Idol" finale unforgettable.

Paula Abdul says she didn't figure out her purpose in life until she became a judge on Fox's "American Idol." "I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on 'American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. "My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success." Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of 'American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul  who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s  says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. Photos: "American Idol" Season 6 "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of 'American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character," she says. The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer." © MMVII The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Skip to next paragraph Paul A. Broben/USA Network Peter Jacobson, left, Debra Messing and Joe Mantegna in this new USA mini-series. In the Magazine: Gigi's Novel Life In a new reality show, Marla Maples, center, is counselor to Kevin, whose wife had an affair. Kim Delaney and Brian McNamara as husband and wife in this new Lifetime series. Betty Friedan made the suburbs safe for sisterhood. By the time Sex and the City rolled around, female bonding  especially over fancy cocktails  was as much a part of popular culture as fishing trips and fraternity hazing rites. The fact that nowadays women are allowed to like one another, even at the expense of men, is at the core of ladies-night hits like Greys Anatomy. So atavistic series like The Bachelor and Desperate Housewives that play down female camaraderie and instead showcase hissy fits and catfights have a naughty, contrarian tang. That retro allure is what drives tonights premiere of The Starter Wife, a USA mini-series that explores the plight of the discarded Hollywood socialite. Its a satire-lite soufflé that follows all the steps of the chick-lit recipe. (If Jane Eyre were written according to todays rules, the orphaned governess would be dragged to a bar by two female friends and a gay male pal and plied with mixed drinks and pool boys until she forgot all about Mr. Rochester and his mad starter wife.) (Will & Grace) plays Molly Kagan, whose studio mogul husband, Kenny (Peter Jacobson), tells her by cellphone that he wants a divorce. Based on a best-selling novel by Gigi Levangie Grazer, the wife of the Hollywood producer , The Starter Wife is a throwback to The Women, Clare Boothe Luces 1936 play about divorce among the rich and pampered. The Starter Wife is set in Malibu and Brentwood, not Park Avenue, so its also a lot like the 1940s radio show Mary Noble, Backstage Wife and the novels of Jackie Collins. These kinds of tell-all tales mix satirical flicks at the follies of the rich and famous (Kenny prepares their young daughter for school by saying, Dont forget to share your cookies with Violet Affleck) with the voyeuristic spectacle of grown-up women channeling their inner Mean Girls. All soap operas centered on women include vixens and villainesses, so the difference lies mainly in the proportion. Molly Kagan has a few loyal female friends  and a gay decorator  but the juice of her tale comes from the snooty, gossiping frienemies who snub her in restaurants and kick her off charity committees when she loses her status as The Wife of. And the beauty of cable lies in the gradation of expectations. On premium networks like HBO or Showtime, The Starter Wife would seem trite and a little too obvious. On USA, its an escapist hoot. The Starter Wife serves as a comic chaser to Army Wives, a more serious, and surprisingly engrossing, Lifetime series on Sunday about what happens to spouses left on base when their soldiers are deployed to combat zones (a lot). Its a little like The Unit, the CBS drama about an elite team of commandos and their wives, but the focus of this Lifetime drama is on the women behind the men in uniform. Army Wives, which stars , examines women of varying age, rank and serial blunder who come together under the stress of military life  and the needling of a few bad women. Not all the bonding spouses are female, however. One member of the clique is an army psychiatrist whose wife returns from a two-year rotation in Afghanistan with a bad case of post-traumatic stress disorder. Female solidarity  or the lack of it  seems to be a popular theme this summer. ABC even ordered up a reality show, Ex-Wives Club, featuring Marla Maples, the former Mrs. ; Angie Everhart, who was once engaged to ; and Shar Jackson, who is the mother of two of Kevin Federlines children and who lost him to . Those three professional exes lend their expertise to ordinary people who are suffering the pain of rejection. Their methods can be brutal. On the premiere, the scornees are sent to a life coach, Debbie Ford, who runs an emotional boot camp in Palm Springs, Calif. The schedule begins early: 8:00 a.m.  Anger. But the founding members of Ex-Wives Club also offer empathy. Ms. Maples was careful in the first episode on Monday to speak well of her ex-husband, but at times she couldnt resist a lateral dig. Ms. Maples helps Kevin, a would-be mortgage broker, organize a networking party in the real estate community. I did this so many years with my ex-husband, she replies when he thanks her. And to be here with someone like you who appreciates it ... Tearing up, she breaks off. Molly could use that kind of support. Instead, when Kenny dumps her for a sexy young pop singer named Shoshanna, Molly finds herself shunned by her fellow worshipers at what she calls the Church of Perpetual Upkeep. After losing her gym membership and even her coveted spot in a Mommy and Me class, she runs away. Not far, however. She retreats to the Malibu house of her oldest and hardest-drinking friend, Joan ( ), who has entered rehab. Lonely, Molly befriends the security guard, Lavender (Anika Noni Rose of Dreamgirls), who is preoccupied with college loans, not collagen. Mollys decorator, Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos), sticks by her, but Cricket (Miranda Otto) is torn. Her husband is a director of blockbuster comedies who wants Kennys studio to back a serious film, The Dutch Bureaucrats Son, and doesnt want Kenny to think he and Cricket side with Molly. It doesnt take long for Cricket to come to her senses. Mollys senses are divided between the flirty overtures of her husbands boss, Lou ( ), and a buff Malibu beach bum, Sam (Stephen Moyer). Army Wives is a street-smart homage to those who also serve because they stand and wait. The Starter Wife is not exactly groundbreaking social satire, but its a sassy look at those who stand behind their Hollywood men, and are waited upon by servants.

Click image to see more pictures. BAD GIRLS GONE WILD Lindsay Lohan isn't the only starlet to find herself making headlines for her troubled lifestyle. - The hotel heiress will have to leave behind purse-size pooch Tinkerbell and all other accessories when she goes to a Los Angeles County jail for violating her probation on a DUI conviction. Hilton, 26, is due to report by June 5 to serve 23 days of a 45-day sentence. - Crooner Lionel Richie's daughter could find herself joining her "Simple Life" co-star Paris in the slammer. The ultra-petite 25-year-old had allegedly been smoking pot and popping Vicodin pills when she was busted last December for driving on the wrong side of a California freeway. It's her second DUI arrest, and a conviction would mean she would have to serve time. - The pop tart checked into rehab after a bizarre meltdown in February during which she shaved her head. Since then, Brit, 25, has been taking steps toward a comeback, but signs that all isn't well resurfaced this month when she threw a hissy fit aboard an L.A.-to-Miami flight because the United Airlines plane didn't have leather seats. The crew, obviously unwilling to listen to more of Ms. Spears' shrewish spiel, let her off the plane. The party may finally be over for Lindsay Lohan. The star-crossed starlet is headed back to rehab, In Touch Weekly magazine reported last night, after a wild Memorial Day weekend in which she crashed her car, was busted for DUI and was later photographed passed out in a car. "She finally realizes it's the right thing to do," In Touch quoted a friend of the actress as saying. "She is going willingly." The magazine said the "Georgia Rule" star was due to check into Promises in Malibu, Calif. - the same facility Britney Spears went to this year after shaving her head. The report came as the Web site x17online.com posted photos showing LiLo - who won't be able to drink legally until she turns 21 on July 2 - taken just 48 hours after the crash. They show a seemingly wasted Lohan passed out in the passenger seat of a car driven by friend and deejay to the stars Samantha Ronson. The pair had just left a Memorial Day pool party at Teddy's at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood when a paparazzo caught up to them at a gas station around 4a.m. yesterday, x17 said. Ronson tried in vain to rouse her sleeping pal, who wore a gray hoodie but no seatbelt, when she realized a photographer was snapping away, x17 said. Ironically, the photos show a medallion dangling in front of the slumbering star from the rear-view mirror. It reads "30 Days" - a reference to the number of days of sobriety. One particularly shocking photo shows Lohan out of the car and on her knees, being watched over by two unidentified men as she seems to vomit on the sidewalk. Another shot shows what appears to be an inch-long fresh cut on the back of her left hand. It was unclear how or when she got the injury. Lohan's rep did not respond to repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. The actress' early morning antics came on the same weekend she was cited for driving under the influence after crashing her Mercedes convertible in Beverly Hills, Calif. Investigators found what they believed to be cocaine in the car after the accident, which happened around 5:30 a.m. Saturday after a night of club crawling. Cops said Lohan could face additional charges when she appears in court Aug. 24. It's the latest in a series of increasingly out-of-control episodes for the young actress. Last summer, a producer scolded herfor failing to show up on the set of the movie "Georgia Rule." She checked into rehab in January, but it wasn't long before she was back on the club scene. And this month she reportedly was thrown out of a hotel where she made a scene after catching love interest Calum Best with another woman. The actress' friends are hoping the tumultuous weekend will serve as a wakeup call. "It's a tough time for her right now," said a close friend, who asked not to be identified. "Everyone is hoping that this is a learning lesson to all."

She said Hasselbeck called and spoke to her partner Kelli Carpenter for a long time. O'Donnell said she didn't speak with Hasselbeck and 'probably won't,' but they did exchange e-mails. The heated debate began Wednesday after O'Donnell's statement about the Iraq war: "655,000 Iraqi civilians have died. Who are the terrorists?" Talk show critics accused O'Donnell of calling U.S. troops terrorists. She called Hasselbeck "cowardly" for not saying anything in response to the critics. "Do not call me a coward, because number one, I sit here every single day, open my heart and tell people what I believe," Hasselbeck fired back, and their riveting exchange continued despite failed attempts by their co-hosts to cut to a commercial. The director used a split screen during the argument with O'Donnell on one side and Hasselbeck on the other. O'Donnell said when she saw the split screen, she "knew it was over" because that made the show look like "The Jerry Springer Show." O'Donnell said she asked for, and received, an early exit from her contract at the daytime chatfest on Friday, ending her eight-month tenure on the show.

News - Hasselbeck Hopes for a Rosie Future - Rosie O'Donnell | Barbara Walters | Rufus Wainwright Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Hasselbeck Hopes for a Rosie Future Tue, 29 May 2007 04:49:14 PM PDT It appears as if that extra day of R&R did everyone good this weekend. While Rosie O&#39;Donnell, now a former cohost of , said in a video posting on her blog that she didn&#39;t envision speaking with Elisabeth Hasselbeck any time soon in light of last week&#39;s politically charged dustup, Hasselbeck was back on the air Tuesday suggesting that a reconciliation was still in the cards. Hasselbeck said that she and O&#39;Donnell were "in communication a lot," although she didn&#39;t specify just how she and her left-leaning ex-colleague were keeping the lines open. "This weekend gave us the opportunity to tackle our most important hot topic yet, and that was the power of forgiveness," Hasselbeck told the audience today. "And so now that enables us to move on in a very positive way...I&#39;m very happy about that." (Translation: Rosie is out, so let&#39;s get on with the show.) Meanwhile, O&#39;Donnell said on her Website Saturday that she wrote Hasselbeck an email, who in turn wrote back&mdash;and that was it. "I haven&#39;t spoken to her, and I probably won&#39;t," O&#39;Donnell said, "and I think it&#39;s just as well." , who wasn&#39;t there for the on-air shenanigans that Joy Behar so desperately tried to moderate, then reassured the audience that she had emailed O&#39;Donnell over the weekend and that they remain "close friends." O&#39;Donnell, whose persistent outspokenness and opinionated banter had been very good for the ratings this past year (especially after she and Donald Trump got into it), will always be welcome as a panelist on the show any time, Walters added. The chattiest of the four chat mavens had been set to leave when her year-long contract ran out at the end of June, but instead expedited her departure after her latest war of words with her conservative counterpart, in which each accused the other of acting cowardly when it came to their political allegiances. First, O&#39;Donnell got on Hasselbeck&#39;s case last Wednesday for not defending her earlier in the week when some conservative critics accused her of comparing U.S. troops in Iraq to terrorists, calling her cohost "cowardly" for saying nothing in her defense. Hasselbeck then fired back by saying that she was not on the show to fight O&#39;Donnell&#39;s battles for her and that she did what she felt was right by asking O&#39;Donnell to take the time to further explain her remarks. "I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s cowardly," Hasselbeck said. "Asking a rhetorical question&mdash;that&#39;s cowardly." The total exchange lasted about 10 minutes before producers finally cut to commercial. O&#39;Donnell then had a scheduled day off on Thursday; however, she ended up calling it quits for good and never came back. But although her schedule opened up a little sooner than she had planned, O&#39;Donnell has already signed up for a trip back to her roots. The former stand-up comic has added another three dates as a special guest on the upcoming True Colors Tour which kicks off June 8, in honor of Gay & Lesbian Pride Month, at Las Vegas&#39; MGM Grand Garden Arena. Benefiting the Human Rights Campaign, the tour will feature the musical talents of Cyndi Lauper, Erasure, Debbie Harry, the Dresden Dolls, the Gossip and the Misshapes. Margaret Cho will emcee the festivities. "It&#39;s a dream come true to be on the road with Cyndi Lauper," O&#39;Donnell said. "I&#39;m almost a rock star!" Lauper, the tour&#39;s founder, seconded the sentiment. "I am thrilled that Rosie is able to do more shows on the tour," the "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" singer said. "We have always wanted to tour together. It&#39;s going to be a blast." O&#39;Donnell will be along for the ride in Las Vegas, Chicago, New York, Dallas, Houston and Washington, D.C. Other acts set to play select dates include , Indigo Girls, the Cliks, Cazwell, Amanda Lepore and Jeffree Star.

At first I didn't want Rosie to leave The View, but now I realize it was for the best. The View will be ending soon, and Rosie will be moving on to bigger and better things. It is so hard for me to read all of these hate-filled posts about Rosie; she is a good person and has done SO much for foster children, soldiers, etc. She has given, given, and given some more. I wish I could say the same for EH. tpiland on 05/30/2007 10:37AM deezjag... it's a bit... deezjag... it's a bit hypocritical of you to say you don't like Rosie because she shoves her political views down your throat but then commend Elisabeth.

I SERIOUSLY doubt that Rosie asked her headwriter to do that. It was just her headwriter's choice to do something as childish as deface EH's pic. And for all you people who say Rosie is a "bully" haven't you ever had an argument with someone and YOU thought YOU were right??? Looks to me like Elisabeth was doing the same thing - she wasn't a mouse in the corner taking Ro's punches. She gave as good as she got. evanettie on 05/30/2007 8:28AM So now Rosie didn't t... So now Rosie didn't think she ever belonged on the View . . . what a crock. That babe needs some serious mental help . . . and I do hope she gets it before she does more damage to herself and her poor kids. Just think what she must be like at home. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but when someone disagreed with her she turned into the school yard bully and made sure you knew you didn't have an opinion if she didn't like it. Dr. Phil would have a field day with her!! tigger624 on 05/30/2007 8:27AM Rosie is a spoiled br... Rosie is a spoiled brat that tries to push her outlandish view points on others.

I must say that I think I would like Rosie in the real world until, that is, she started shoving her political views down my throat! I really enjoyed watching her on The View until she would start in ranting and raving about her point of view. My impression is, if you don't agree with Rosie she will railroad and bully her way through a conversation... just like she did last week with Elisabeth! I was glad to see Elisabeth FINALLY stand up for herself and not allow anymore of Rosie's crap! deezjag on 05/30/2007 7:19AM Elizabeth, a nobody! ... Elizabeth, a nobody! It's comical when you look at the panel and their individual accomplishments. Elizabeth's resume includes Survivor? Oops, guess sanctimonious could be added as well. Like it or not, Rosie's a powerplay in Hollywood, always has been and always will be. Rosie can impact Elizabeth's career from A-Z if she chose to. Elizabeth's short stint at attempted fame is almost over, she'll have few television prospects due to her childish onscreen activity. EFan on 05/30/2007 6:56AM I love Rosie...you go...

When she came back and told Rosie that what is really cowardly is to ask rhetorical questions...she NAILED it!!

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Spector Defense Targets Forensic Errors Wednesday, May 30, 2007; 9:20 PM LOS ANGELES -- A coroner who concluded that Lana Clarkson's death was a homicide testified Wednesday in Phil Spector's murder trial that he cannot tell from autopsy results whether the actress was holding the gun that killed her. The statement was important because the music producer's defense is seeking to show that the 40-year-old killed herself. The coroner, Dr. Louis Pena, said he left the manner of death in the case undetermined for seven months before he wrote a report finding it was a homicide. Dr. Louis Pena, a deputy medical examiner, testifies during cross-examination in the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector, Wednesday, May 30, 2007, at Los Angeles Superior Court in Los Angeles. Investigators made mistakes in evidence collection and handling in actress Lana Clarkson's shooting death, including the loss of a piece of one of her teeth, Pena conceded Wednesday. (AP Photo/Robyn Beck, Pool) (Robyn Beck - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Pena said that Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as "pending" until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didn't necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. "There are two ways to look at it," said Pena. "It implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity." On Tuesday, Pena testified that Clarkson had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. But he conceded Wednesday he didn't consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The medical examiner also said that criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarkson's teeth. Pena acknowledged in cross-examination by defense attorney Christopher Plourd that the mistakes also included moving Clarkson's body, which caused blood to flow out of her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Pena said the lost tooth fragment was the fault of an odontologist _ a forensic dentist _ who was called in on the case. "There were three vials collected to be examined by the odontologist," Pena said. "What happened is on review in meeting with the odontologist he admitted he broke one of the vials and the tooth fragment was lost. It flew around the room somewhere." Asked how this happened, Pena said, "When my back was turned he took it out, cracked the vial, panicked _ as he told me _ and sealed it again." Pena said the fragment was never found. The coroner said he had found some of the tooth fragments on a red carpet in front of Clarkson's body and some on a staircase nearby, indicating that the force of the gunshot fired inside her mouth sent her two front teeth flying out. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coroner's office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarkson's dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised the ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. As for the blood from the mouth, the memo said, "Body movement caused oral purge which soaked the side of the dress and also compromised evaluation of the dress for blood spatter." In other testimony, Pena said he was aware at the death scene that a piece of acrylic nail was missing from Clarkson's right thumb. The prosecution claims that defense experts later found the piece of nail when they searched the scene but withheld it from authorities. Pena said there was no evidence that Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. Clarkson had been taking two drugs generally given for depression, but her neurologist had prescribed them for her chronic headaches, the coroner said. He said she died with a purse on one shoulder in a stranger's home, which he said is not typical of someone taking her own life. He also cited evidence that the gun had been wiped and a large amount of Clarkson's blood was in the left pocket of Spector's pants, which could indicate the gun was placed in the pocket. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the "Wall of Sound" recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Corman's 1985 cult film "Barbarian Queen."

The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which regulates liquor licensing, is looking into whether alcohol was served illegally to Lohan in the hours before her arrest by police in Beverly Hills, an agency spokesman said on Wednesday. The 20-year-old actress was booked on suspicion of driving under the influence after running her Mercedes over a curb and into a hedge at about 5:30 a.m. on Saturday. Police said they also found a substance in the car they believe to be cocaine. Her arrest came about two hours after she was seen leaving a popular Hollywood eatery. It was followed by a second night of partying that ended early Monday with Lohan captured in widely published photos passed out in the front seat of a car. Later that day, Lohan, an acknowledged Alcoholic Anonymous member who underwent rehab earlier this year, checked herself into another treatment facility. Lohan's latest woes cast doubt about whether the promising young actress, publicly rebuked by a producer last year for on-set tardiness, would be available to begin shooting her next film as planned with Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine. Her arrest also focused attention on the nightclubs and restaurants that cater to Hollywood's rich and famous and their complicity in serving alcohol to individuals under the legal drinking age of 21. A flurry of reports about underage stars and lesser-known minors frequenting Los Angeles-area nightspots prompted the state's ABC board to launch an enforcement crackdown that has resulted in 10 undercover operations so far, agency spokesman John Carr said. &copy; Reuters 2007.

All I do is ask questions Geek boy meets gorgeous girl. Girl gets pregnant. Boy embraces fatherhood. Our correspondent meets the director behind a seriously funny sex comedy to not show photographer information --> to not show image description --> to not show enlarge option --> Something is changing in the world of American screen comedy. Inane semen-splattered teen movies in the vein of American Pie are out, as are witless pastiches in the Scary Movie mould. And so too are puerile efforts such as Beerfest. In their place come character-led dramatic comedies. These are cleverly constructed stories, heartfelt and often profane, intricately scripted and yet laden with gags, and all delivered by a peerless ensemble of character actors and up-and-coming comedy giants. The 40-Year-Old Virgin was one. Will Ferrell&rsquo;s Anchorman was another, as was Talladega Nights. These movies, hugely popular with global audiences, have made nearly $1 billion (&pound;1.97 million) in revenue and have inspired a comedy wave that&rsquo;s about to crash on our shores this summer with the peerless pregnancy caper Knocked Up, followed by a slew of side-splitters, including Superbad, Walk Hard and Step Brothers. And what&rsquo;s more, every one of them can be traced back to one unassuming man &ndash; the unsung comedy hero and current God of Gags, Judd Apatow. &ldquo;I just see it all as an embarrassment of riches at the moment,&rdquo; says the 39-year-old writer-director-producer, a former stand-up comedian who for years survived by writing gags for Jim Carrey and producing television shows, before making it big with two Will Ferrell comedies and his own directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Now, he says, half-be-mused at his own success, he simply can&rsquo;t get the movies out fast enough. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been totally bananas,&rdquo; he says, about his new role as a comedy mogul. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve shot six movies this year alone. They&rsquo;re all movies that we have worked on for a long time, with different writers and directors. But once a few of our movies did well we had a flood of projects go straight into development.&rdquo; The first is Knocked Up, Apatow&rsquo;s highly anticipated directorial follow-up to Virgin and a searing exemplar of the New Comedy. The movie has an ostensibly simple premise &ndash; a stoner schlub called Ben (Seth Rogen) impregnates glamorous career woman Alison (Katherine Heigl) during a one-night stand and hilarity ensues. Yet the unfettered genius here is that Apatow uses this familiar framework on which to hang lovingly crafted characters and deliciously uncomfortable drama. For instance, Alison&rsquo;s sister Debbie (played by Apatow&rsquo;s wife, Leslie Mann) is in the middle of a marriage implosion and has savagely funny arguments with her screen husband Pete (Paul Rudd). Marriage is like a comedy with all the jokes removed, complains Pete at one point, adding, &ldquo;Instead of pithy dialogue, everyone&rsquo;s just pissed off!&rdquo; Elsewhere there&rsquo;s profanity-laden dialogue, inspired sexual innuendo, relentless pot-smoking, and a comedy set piece that revolves around awkward pregnancy sex between Ben and Alison. All of this, naturally, has landed Knocked Up with a family-unfriendly R rating in America (somewhere between a 15 and an 18 in Britain). Yet Apatow remains unapologetic and sees it, instead, as a badge of honour for the New Comedy. &ldquo;For me, if you&rsquo;re going to attempt to be truthful, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to do it with any rating other than an R,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to tell a story about relationships &ndash; you know, people curse, they have sex, and they smoke things they shouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; all of that puts you in an R.&rdquo; Apatow grew up on Long Island. A physically weak kid, he says he was obsessed by comedy from the age of 10 and used to transcribe episodes of Saturday Night Live to understand it better. His parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother started working at a comedy club near his home in Huntington, called East Side. There Apatow would interview comedy giants such as Eddie Murphy and Roseanne Barr, ostensibly for his high-school radio station, but really, he says, to discover the secrets of great comedy. &ldquo;I did about 50 interviews and they really did give me the answers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And the main bit of advice I got was that I needed to be patient. So I worked really hard. I always assumed that I would get better, and I wasn&rsquo;t anxious about making it.&rdquo; Apatow moved to Los Angeles after high school and started doing stand-up at the city&rsquo;s famous comedy club, the Improv. But success as a performer eluded him. &ldquo;At the time I lived with Adam Sandler, and I was opening up for Jim Carrey, and it became clear to me that I was never going to be as good as any of these guys. So I began selling jokes to support myself.&rdquo; He quickly graduated from gag-seller to writer-producer and the brain behind such award-winning television as The Larry Sanders Show and The Ben Stiller Show. He says that after four years in television he thought, finally: &ldquo;Well, I guess I should go get some testicles and attempt to make a movie.&rdquo; His first attempt was a producer&rsquo;s role on the wildly successful Will Ferrell vehicle Anchorman, followed by his directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Meanwhile, he had built up his own stable of new white-hot writers and directors, including Rogen, who has written the high-school comedy Superbad, and the director Jake Kasdan, who has just finished an Apatow-scripted mock musical biopic called Walk Hard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a goof on movies like Ray and Walk the Line,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And I have to say, it&rsquo;s as funny as anything that we&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; And yet, untold riches and a preeminent place in the New Comedy universe will not make you happy, Apatow cautions. &ldquo;One thing I&rsquo;ve learnt from all this is that success is just as uncomfortable as failure. When all these good things happen, it simply takes the cloak off your &lsquo;real&rsquo; problems.&rdquo; So why do you keep going? &ldquo;I think that, after a while, making comedy becomes a defence mechanism. There probably is a great argument for stopping, but at some point it becomes your way of navigating life, and you slowly realise that you don&rsquo;t know how to do anything else.&rdquo; &mdash; Knocked Up opens nationwide on August 24 Apatow, nurturer of comic talent Cast in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Rogen finally takes centre stage in Knocked Up. Also a writer, his Superbad is being produced by Apatow. Mann met Apatow on the set of The Cable Guy. They married in 1997. In Knocked Up she plays a long-suffering wife. The son of Lawrence Kasdan ( The Big Chill) has directed the mock musical biopic Walk Hard, co-written by Apatow. Apatow, friend of the famous A friend since Carrey&rsquo;s stand-up days. Apatow contributed uncredited &ldquo;punch-ups&rdquo; on scripts for Carrey&rsquo;s Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty. He met Stiller in 1990, outside an Elvis Costello concert. Apatow then wrote and produced Stiller&rsquo;s Emmy award-winning series The Ben Stiller Show. Shared a flat with Apatow during the pair&rsquo;s early years at the LA comedy club, the Improv. When Sandler hit the big time, Apatow helped out on the script for Happy Gilmore. Apatow met Shandling at the East Side stand-up club when he was still in high school. Later, Apatow was a writer-producer on The Larry Sanders Show. Apatow met him on the set of Anchorman, where Carell told him about a sketch involving a middle-aged man trying to hide his virginity from his friends. The 40-Year-Old Virgin &ndash; and Carell&rsquo;s stardom &ndash; were born. * Town / City Save to my times One last drop in the Ocean?

http://people.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1311699.php/Hogzilla_killer_is_11_year-old_Alabama_boy&cid Hogzilla killer is 11 year-old Alabama boy - People Hogzilla killer is 11 year-old Alabama boy May 31, 2007, 14:38 GMT May 31st, 2007 - 15:27:45 No big deal, I was shooting an army carbine in 6th grade. Its great to see a kid outside hunting instead of sitting in front on the tv or playing dumb computer games. I hope he kills a bigger one next year. Congrats May 31st, 2007 - 15:41:09 I really get annoyed when people who have no knowledge of gun saftey or hunting traditions make ignorant comments. This 11 year old boy was out hunting with the supervision of his father. He was obviously taught at a young age how to properly & safely handle a firearm. He is not going to be the child who causes an accident because of this. What is really dangerous is when an ignorant adult man who has never had training decides that one day he wants to go hunting & then buys a gun that he has no idea how to use & goes out without supervision because it is ok & he is an adult. That's what I am afraid of. Gun saftey starts with education & boys who are interested in hunting should be educated properly & early on. The best education is supervised experience. May 31st, 2007 - 15:46:24 sorry, I was raised to be kind to living creatures. Hunting and killing is a 'tradition' lost on me. There are too many gun toting kids for my taste too. Sue me. May 31st, 2007 - 16:14:11 I agree with you Stone. Yes he was supervised but it only takes a blink on an eye for something to happen and besides who in their right mind would let an 11 year old CHILD handle a gun. I wonder what the next thing he'll shoot. Someone's pet?

Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Lindsay Lohan returns to rehab A tour bus passes the location where Lindsay Lohan was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Saturday, May 26, after her convertible struck a curb at Sunset Boulevard and Foothill Road in Beverly Hills, Calif. Lohan charged with DUI, investigated for drugs May 30, 2007 - 10:06AM Actress Lindsay Lohan has returned to rehab after a weekend drunken-driving arrest, her publicist said on Tuesday, raising questions about whether she can start shooting her latest film as planned. Official word that Lohan was back in treatment came hours after entertainment trade paper said she had just joined the cast of , a comedy starring Shirley MacLaine and set to begin filming this week. But her Beverly Hills arrest on Saturday on suspicion of driving under the influence, and police reports that a substance believed to be cocaine was found in the car, triggered a wave of headlines trumpeting Hollywood's latest celebrity relapse. Less than 48 hours after the arrest, Lohan was photographed slumped in the passenger seat of a car. posted the photos yesterday , which it said were taken early that morning at a petrol station after the 20-year-old actress left the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California, with a girlfriend. The photos show Lohan, wearing a grey hooded sweat shirt, with her mouth open and her eyes shut, apparently asleep. Another photo shows her kneeling on the ground, her back to the camera, apparently vomiting before getting into the vehicle. "Lindsay admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility on Memorial Day," her publicist has said in a statement. "Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation," the statement continued. No further details were given. But several celebrity news outlets, including magazine online, said Lohan checked in on Monday to the Promises treatment centre in Malibu, the luxury facility where pop star Britney Spears was recently a patient. According to TMZ's report, Lohan was admitted to Promises for in-patient treatment, possibly for 30 days, sparking questions about a potential conflict with her new film. Representatives for the film's production company, Still Rolling Prods, and MacLaine, who also is co-producing the film, were not immediately available for comment. But it would not be the first time that Lohan's personal life has put her at odds with demands of her career. Last July, the producer of&#160; took the unusual step of going public with a letter to Lohan scolding her for repeatedly showing up late on the set. In his unusual reprimand, the Morgan Creek Prods executive James Robinson called her behavior "discourteous, irresponsible and unprofessional" and cited her "ongoing all-night heavy partying" as the reason for her tardiness. Lohan returned to work the next day, and , which paired her with film legend Jane Fonda, was released earlier this month. Earlier this year, following completion of filming,&#160;Lohan underwent her first stint in rehab.

News - Match Game Fixture Reilly Dies Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Mon, 28 May 2007 08:50:24 PM PDT Jack Lemmon and Steve McQueen were New York acting school contemporaries of the acclaimed stage star and director named...blank. answer is: Charles Nelson Reilly. Reilly, whose award-winning theater career was overshadowed by his knack for filling in the blanks with punchlines on and other TV game shows, has died of pneumonia, his partner told Monday&#39;s The actor-director passed away last Friday in his Beverly Hills home, Patrick Hughes told the paper. Reilly was said to have been in failing health for more than a year. He was 76. For the uninitiated, the Game Show Network offers everyday proof of why Reilly was as much a part of the 1970s as the pet rock. The Internet Broadway Database offers evidence of a career that was much broader than his banter with Brett Somers suggested. Reilly directed five Broadway plays, appeared in the original productions of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , earned three Tony nominations, including one for directing the 1997 production of , and won one, for his supporting work in In 2002, Reilly won a Drama Desk Award for his one-man show of an autobiography, Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly "I was told that I would never be allowed on television," Reilly said in the show&#39;s 2006 film version, The Life of Reilly , "and now I gotta try to figure out who do you have to f--- to get off." The quip offered a good summary of Reilly&#39;s career, if not his career dilemma: Once told by a network executive that TV was off-limits to "queers," the Bronx-born actor, who was gay, became known as a TV personality to the exclusion of everything else. Reilly guested on sitcoms ( Nanny and the Professor The Patty Duke Show , etc.), cackled his way through a children&#39;s show (Sid and Marty Krofft&#39;s colorful, but typically creepy ), sat down on couch 95 times, per one popularly cited count, and, of course, did game shows. Lots of game shows. were among Reilly&#39;s credits. was by far the biggest. To explain exactly what was, or what Reilly did on it, is perhaps best left to a Game Show Network description of a February 1976 episode: "Brett and Charles get into such a bad fight that Gene separates them, moving Charles to the bottom row." Brett was the aforementioned Brett Somers, an actress best known, like Reilly, for being the game-show version of herself. Gene was Gene Rayburn, the host best known for his probe-like microphone. , it was less of a quiz show, and more of an excuse for Reilly, Somers and Rayburn (and sometimes Richard Dawson and Fannie Flagg) to bicker, try to make each other laugh, and unleash some barely doubled entendres. With apologies to Somers&#39; giant glasses, and Rayburn&#39;s impossibly long microphone, Reilly cut the show&#39;s most distinctive figure, as he was often seen puffing a pipe, wearing a captain&#39;s hat and donning glasses even larger than Somers&#39;. The most popular version of ran on daytime TV from 1973 to &#39;79, and in syndication from 1975 to &#39;81, per an accounting by Total Television. , Reilly frequently worked with to the star&#39;s 1990s sitcom, . He also found success with Chris Carter, appearing on a 1996 episode of Carter&#39;s , and a 1997 episode of the producer&#39;s lesser-known series, . Reilly played the same character, a writer named Jose Chung, in both Carter shows; he netted the second of his three career Emmy nominations for the Born Jan. 13, 1931, per the Internet Movie Database, Reilly trained for the acting life under the tutelage of Uta Hagen, and alongside the likes of Lemmon and McQueen. Those master classes won&#39;t be on cable TV on Tuesday morning or the morning after that; will. As Reilly well knew. "When I die, it&#39;s going to read, &#39;Game Show Fixture Passes Away,&#39;" Reilly once said, per a Hollywood Stock Exchange review of Life of Reilly. "Nothing about the theater, or Tony Awards, or Emmys. But it doesn&#39;t bother me."

Dressed in a black, red and purple Japanese-style gown, Riyo Mori nervously grabbed the hands of first runner-up, Natalia Guimaraes of Brazil, just before the winner was announced. Then she threw her hands up and covered her mouth, overcome with emotion. Winner of Miss Universe 2007, Miss Japan Riyo Mori parades in the evening gown competition of the pageant at the National Auditorium in Mexico City May 28, 2007. [Reuters] But she gathered herself together enough to catch the diamond-and-pearl-studded headpiece valued at $250,000 as it slipped off her head when Miss Universe 2006 Zuleyka Rivera of Puerto Rico crowned her. Mori immediately placed it back on her head. The last time Japan won the pageant was in 1959 when Akiko Kojima became the first Miss Universe from Asia. "She is an amazing champion, an amazing woman and I hear that they go totally insane in Japan, so that's good," said Donald Trump, who co-owns the pageant with NBC. Miss USA Rachel Smith, who slipped and fell to the floor during the evening gown competition and was jeered by the Mexican audience during the interview phase, was the contest's fourth runner-up. Mori, from the small town of Shizuoka at the base of Mount Fuji, won the cheers of the Mexico City audience when she opened her interview, saying 'Hola, Mexico!' "I learned how to always be happy, be patient and to be positive, and this is what I want to teach to the next generation," she said during the interview competition. The daughter of a dance school operator, Mori said her grandmother told her as a child that she wanted her to be Miss Japan before she turned 20. "From the very beginning, I entered the competition with high hopes and an unswerving determination to make this dream a reality," she said in a pre-competition interview. She wants to someday open an international dance school in Tokyo. "Right now I am only 20 years old, so I'm really excited about what I'm going to be able to do at this age to benefit society," Mori said after winning. Smith was booed during her interview and several audience members chanted "Mexico! Mexico!" until she spoke in Spanish, saying "Buenas noches Mexico. Muchas gracias!" which earned her applause. Mexico has a fierce rivalry with its northern neighbor. Also finishing in the top five were second runner-up Ly Jonaitis of Venezuela and third runner-up Honey Lee of Korea. The winner travels the world for a year on behalf of charities and pageant sponsors. The 15 finalists from a field of 77 contestants were announced early in Monday's show. They were picked last week during preliminary judging in the contest's swimsuit, evening gown and interview categories. Their names were not announced until Monday, allowing all 77 to be introduced to the television audience. As soon as the final 15 had been selected, they immediately strutted across the stage in animal-print bikinis for the swimsuit competition. After the evening gown competition, five contestants were eliminated, and the judges chose the winner from the five remaining. Missing from this year's contest was Miss Sweden, whose country is one of the few to win the crown three times. Isabel Lestapier Winqvist, 20, dropped out because many Swedes say the competition does not represent the modern woman. Hours before the pageant began, dozens of protesters held a mock ceremony in downtown Mexico City that featured "Miss Marijuana," "Miss Sexual Health," "Miss Human Rights" and other candidates with obscenities written across their sashes. The group yelled "Neither ugly nor beautiful, should a woman be considered an object!" Pageant organizers say the Miss Universe contest carefully selects women who are intelligent, well-mannered and cultured. 1999 Miss Teen USA Vanessa Minnillo and "Extra" weekend correspondent Mario Lopez hosted the live, two-hour telecast, broadcast on NBC and Telemundo, expected to be viewed by more than 600 million people in more than 180 countries. The celebrity judges included actor James Kyson Lee, model Lindsay Clubine, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, rocker Dave Navarro, Olympic figure skating champion Michelle Kwan, celebrity hairstylist Ken Paves, fashion designer Marc Bouwer, "Project Runway" judge and Elle magazine fashion director Nina Garcia and former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres.

For some, a poorly written email has cost them customers and their business's reputation. For others, poorly written and emails in bad taste has cost them their jobs. Eric Govan's 'Ghetto Prom Pics' email sent to reporters, columnists and sports editors got him fired from his coveted position in media relations for the Golden State Warriors. So this is bad PR for Nicole Richie, cracking jokes about the emaciated in Hollywood, what if it was an email bad-mouthing a co-star, collaborator or producer. These days, email etiquette and checking your 'to' field is a must in both your personal and business lives. May 30th, 2007 - 04:01:47 why does anyone give the time of day to these no-talent celebrities?? There are many others out there who are smart, talented and respectful - so ignore this group of slime!

Giant hog shot in Alabama An 11-year-old Alabama boy used a pistol to kill a wild hog his father says weighed a staggering 1,051 pounds and measured 9-feet-4 from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. Think hams as big as car tires. If the claims are accurate, Jamison Stone's trophy boar would be bigger than Hogzilla, the famed wild hog that was killed in south Georgia in 2004. Hogzilla originally was thought to weigh 1,000 pounds and measure 12 feet in length. National Geographic experts who unearthed its remains believe the animal actually weighed about 800 pounds and was 8 feet long. Regardless of the comparison, Jamison is reveling in the attention over his pig, which has a Web site put up by his father -- www.monsterpig.com -- that is generating Internet buzz. "It feels really good," Jamison, of Pickensville, said. "It's a good accomplishment. I probably won't ever kill anything else that big." Jamison, who killed his first deer at age 5, was hunting with father Mike Stone and two guides in east Alabama on May 3 when he bagged Hogzilla II. He said he shot the huge animal eight times with a .50-caliber revolver and chased it for three hours through hilly woods before finishing it off with a point-blank shot. Through it all there was the fear that the animal would turn and charge them, as wild boars have a reputation of doing. "I was a little bit scared, a little bit excited," said Jamison, who just finished the sixth grade on the honor roll at Christian Heritage Academy, a small, private school. His father said that, just to be extra safe, he and the guides had high-powered rifles aimed and ready to fire in case the beast with 5-inch tusks decided to charge. With the pig finally dead in a creek bed on the 2,500-acre Lost Creek Plantation, a commercial hunting preserve in Delta, trees had to be cut down and a backhoe brought in to bring Jamison's prize out of the woods. It was hauled on a truck to the Clay County Farmers Exchange in Lineville, where Jeff Kinder said they used his scale, which was recently calibrated, to weigh the hog. Kinder, who didn't witness the weigh-in, said he was baffled to hear the reported weight of 1,051 pounds because his scale -- an old, manual style with sliding weights -- only measures to the nearest 10. "I didn't quite understand that," he said. Mike Stone said the scale balanced one notch past the 1,050-pound mark, and he thought it meant a weight of 1,051 pounds. "It probably weighed 1,060 pounds. We were just afraid to change it once the story was out," he said. The hog's head is now being mounted on an extra-large foam form by Jerry Cunningham of Jerry's Taxidermy in Oxford. Cunningham said the animal measured 54 inches around the head, 74 inches around the shoulders and 11 inches from the eyes to the end of its snout. "It's huge," he said. "It's just the biggest thing I've ever seen." Mike Stone is having sausage made from the rest of the animal. "We'll probably get 500 to 700 pounds," he said. Jamison, meanwhile, has been offered a small part in "The Legend of Hogzilla," a small-time horror flick based on the tale of the Georgia boar. The movie is holding casting calls with plans to begin filming in Georgia. Jamison is enjoying the newfound celebrity generated by the hog hunt, but he said he prefers hunting pheasants to monster pigs. "They are a little less dangerous."

During the celebrity-infested barbecue, held at the house of Richie's friend, the socialite reportedly didn't touch the food. "Nicole didn't eat anything," a witness told US magazine Reports claim it was at the same Memorial Day barbecue that Mischa Barton fell ill and had to be rushed to hospital after reportedly consuming a stomach-churning mix of antibiotics and alcohol. However, new rumours originating from suggest that Barton actually overdosed on magic mushrooms and cocaine and had to be evacuated from the party on a stretcher. "It was total chaos," one partygoer told the site. Paris Hilton's recent jail sentence has reportedly left Richie terrified that she will also wind up in jail. "When Nicole heard about Paris' sentence, she broke down," an insider said. "She's been eating less. She's only sleeping three hours a night. She has nightmares about being in prison and wakes up in cold sweats." Richie is reportedly doing outpatient rehab treatment with Beau Monde Programs.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-miller/laughing-with-charles-nel_b_49681.html&cid Danny Miller: Laughing with Charles Nelson Reilly | The Huffington Post Laughing with Charles Nelson Reilly Posted May 28, 2007 I was lucky enough to know Charles Nelson Reilly, one of the funniest people on the planet. Reilly died this weekend after a very long illness, and today is being mourned by his showbiz colleagues, the public at large, and his legions of former acting students. Charles' oft-stated concern that when he died the headlines would read "Game Show Fixture Passes Away" has come true in part (I saw that exact headline on several news sites) but plenty of people also remember his Tony Award-winning performances in the theatre and his amazing work as a director of plays and opera. My wife Kendall Hailey was a close friend of Charles and his partner Patrick. He jokingly called her his fiancÃ©e during much of their friendship and somewhere there is a fake prom photo that Charles staged in the 1980s with Kendall in a ghastly taffeta dress and Charles wearing a frilly tuxedo and a purposely bad toupee. Kendall used it as her Christmas card that year and her conservative Texas grandparents were concerned about her "boyfriend" who seemed so much older. Kendall could almost be considered a Love Child of "The Match Game." Charles' sparring partner, Brett Somers, is Kendall's godmother, and as far as I'm concerned, her biggest claim to fame was when Brett wrote "Happy Birthday Kendall" on one of her "Match Game" cards when Kendall was a kid and held it up to the camera, prompting a discussion about her birthday with host Gene Rayburn. I still love watching the old "Match Game" episodes on the Game Show Network. In my opinion some of the best comedy ever seen on television came from the impromptu antics of Charles and Brett on that show. They got away with a ribald, wicked repartee that would never be allowed on network television today--at least not without massive FCC fines. As anyone who met him knows, from his celebrity friends to the fans on the street to his nurses in the hospital, being in Charles' presence was like being a willing victim of a high energy tsunami. Hearing him tell anecdotes about his crazy life was irresistible and you never wanted him to stop, he was so much fun to be around. He seemed to know everyone in showbiz, from the sublime to the ridiculous, and he spoke reverentially of many of his talented friends, including Uta Hagen and Julie Harris. He directed Miss Harris in "The Belle of Amherst" and an acclaimed revival of "The Gin Game," after starring with her decades earlier in the musical "Skyscraper." As a child I was most familiar with Charles as Claymore Gregg in the TV series, "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir," as well as the villainous magician Horatio J. HooDoo in the freaky Sid and Marty Krofft series "Lidsville" from the early 70s. The writers of this show may not have consciously been making drug references in the scripts but it's hard to believe that the person who created this land of living hats wasn't smoking something! Reading some of the accolades today, I am struck by the diversity of the people from all walks of life who loved him. Charles was one of the first openly gay men on television, and probably did more to promote gay rights than many activists marching in the street. My brother-in-law, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, was a huge Charles fan. A few years ago, when Jeff was in town mixing the Wilco CD "Summerteeth," we brought Charles to the recording studio for a visit. Charles immediately had the entire rock crowd under his spell. They all wanted to pose for pictures with him and they seemed more excited to see Charles than if a member of the Rolling Stones had wandered in. Someone handed him a CD by a band called the Didjits called "Full Nelson Reilly" and Charles signed it to Jeff, "From one rock star to another." Kendall's favorite Charles story takes place when he was appearing in New York and staying at the Wyndham Hotel. Charles found himself riding in the elevator alone with Sir Laurence Olivier. He said nothing to Olivier on the way up but as the elevator door opened, Charles turned to the renowned actor and deadpanned, "If I'd known this was a theatrical establishment, I would have booked elsewhere." Charles had a great sense of humor about all things, including himself. Has there ever been anyone more parodied than he was? Remember Alec Baldwin's killer impersonation on "Saturday Night Live?" Charles didn't stop working until he got sick, and he was known to more recent audiences as Jose Chung on "The X Files" and "Millennium" and the voice of the Dirty Bubble on "SpongeBob SquarePants." I wish I could have seen Charles in his early plays which included "Bye, Bye Birdie," "Hello, Dolly," and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." But we loved seeing Charles perform his moving autobiographical show, "Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly," which, thank God, has been turned into a documentary by Barry Poltermann that debuted last year at the SXSW Festival and is winning awards at film festivals all over the country. Here's the trailer and a poignant glimpse at the genius that is Charles Nelson Reilly: Read All Posts by The Mollycoddling of Rosie O'Donnell Arianna Huffington: Notes from the D Conference: An iPhone Tip from Steve Jobs and Genetic Info from 23andMe Philip Giraldi: No New 9/11?

Michael Lohan says his daughter Lindsay is in a detox program to kick multiple addictions to alcohol and drugs including the prescription painkiller OxyContin. "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay because I want to make sure she is getting the right care," Michael Lohan told E! Online's The Planet Gossip co-host Tina Dirmann. "And I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from painkillers and things. That's a very important step." Michael Lohan, who was released from New York's Collins Correctional Facility in March after serving nearly two years on attempted assault and other charges, has had his own battles with addiction. He went to bible college while behind bars and became a minister with the Assemblies of God Ministry. Photos: Livin' La Vida Lohan That's why he's pleased that there's a spiritual aspect to the recovery program his daughter will undergo. "I learned they use the 12-step program, which includes a lot of lessons bases on God's teachings, so I was satisfied with that," he said. "First she needs to get clean, then she needs to let God in her life." Meanwhile, authorities conducting undercover operations at trendy celebrity watering holes in recent weeks want to know if Lindsay Lohan, who's still underage, was served alcohol before a weekend car crash. California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control investigators also want to know if Lohan or others were served after hours, agency spokesman John Carr said. Videos show Lohan leaving Hollywood's Les Deux club at 3:30 a.m. Alcohol cannot be served in California after 2 a.m. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control told the Beverly Hills Police Department it wants to review witness reports and other evidence to determine if a formal investigation is warranted, Carr said. Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore said Lohan had dinner and wasn't drinking. "Because of the enormous paparazzi presence outside of Les Deux that night, we allowed her to stay late and wait for her friends," according to a statement released by Moore. Lindsay Lohan, right, shown here partying with her pal DJ Samantha Ronson, at Tokyo's Warehouse nightclub on April 12, 2007. Authorities are investigating whether the 20-year-old was served drinks at a Los Angeles nightclub before her car crash last weekend. Lohan, who turns 21 on July 2, was behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz that was heavily damaged when it crashed into a curb and bushes on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills early Saturday. Lohan was arrested for investigation of driving under the influence. Her publicist announced the actress entered a rehabilitation facility on Monday. "We have a duty to check on these things whenever there's a report of a minor involved in a crash," Carr said, noting "underage drinking is a huge problem in the state of California." Some 1,574 people were killed in alcohol-related vehicle crashes last year and about 200 involved underage drinking. There have been 10 recent enforcement operations involving Alcoholic Beverage Control and Los Angeles police officers checking Los Angeles-area clubs, Carr said. The agency has four investigators in Los Angeles. Club Teddy's at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood paid a $3,000 fine on May 4 for accusations last year that it sold contaminated beverages and sold alcohol after hours, Carr said. Photos: Celebrity Mug Shots There's also a pending investigation now in the hearing process against Hollywood Boulevard's Club Mood, another popular nightspot for young Hollywood, Carr said. There are no pending ABC enforcement actions against Les Deux. "We do investigate any time we get complaints when someone underage is being served. Anyone under the age of 21 cannot be sold alcohol in California." If they do, Carr said it can result in a fine, suspension of the club's ABC license to sell liquor or revocation of its liquor license. © MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Now she's catching heat over a joke party invitation she sent out. Nicole, whose anorexia and drunken driving are famous, asked pals to come "celebrate our country" on Memorial Day "by drinking massive amounts of beer." The invite instructs female guests to "start starving yourself" because "There will be a scale at the front door. No girls over 100 pounds allowed in." In Touch Weekly got hold of the invitation, and got boring old "experts" like Dr. to shake their heads and say "tsk, tsk." (This was, we now know, the party from which had to be rushed to a hospital, perhaps for celebrating her country too vigorously.) Now Richie's publicist is trying to save face, telling Us Weekly: "This invitation was sent via e-mail to her friends who understand that she was responding in a joking manner to the constant untruths printed about her in the media."

Well the latest news is that Universal Studios have named it The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. This Harry Potter Theme Park will become part of Universalâs Islands of Adventure theme park and in the press release they said âThe fully immersive, themed land will enable guests to visit some of the most iconic locations found in the books and the films including the village of Hogsmeade, the mysterious Forbidden Forest, and even Hogwarts castle itselfâ. This is great news for all the Harry Potter fans around (that includes me), the J.K. Rowling books and films have inspired the Wizarding World of Harry Potter to happen because of such a big following that the series has gained. It will be late in 2009 when the new Harry Potter world will launch and it will feature interactive attractions (3D Like Attractions) and immersive rides, restaurants and experiential shops.

Go to a Section: 11:52AM EDT, Thu 31 May 2007 Messing magnificent in "Starter Wife" Wed May 30, 2007 9:25AM EDT Female action pics need heroes of their own It's "Happening" for Deschanel in Shyamalan movie Waitress set for stardom after Clooney sing-song Thompson says he'll run for U.S. president LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Debra Messing reportedly was determined to exorcise any trace of her "Will & Grace" character Grace Adler from her persona while shooting her mostly inspired (if a bit transparently shallow) new six-hour USA Network miniseries "The Starter Wife," and darned if she doesn't pull it off. Messing is magnetic and alluring in the adaptation of Gigi Levangie Grazer's best-selling novel inspired by her split -- temporary, as it turned out -- from high-powered Hollywood hubby Brian Grazer. The mini is about being shunted aside for a newer, blonder piece of eye candy and having to dig deep to find one's essence once the parties stop and the high-powered life itself divorces you. Messing is more than up to the task of bringing this social death to life, effectively erasing any memory of that job she used to have on that NBC comedy, whatever it was called. "Wife" is entertaining and bitingly irreverent, at once sweet and sour. It ropes you in because Messing is so adept at making us like her neurotic personage. If there is an abiding problem with the mini (and this isn't insignificant), it's that it actually is based on something of a flawed premise. It isn't a riches-to-rags story so much as a riches-to-riches. See, after Molly Kagan's (Messing) little weasel of a husband, Kenny (nice work from Peter Jacobson), dumps her to take up with young blonde bimbette Shoshanna (Trilby Glover), she isn't forced to take her daughter and share a one-bedroom apartment in Alhambra. She's allowed to stay in the beachfront Malibu Colony estate of a friend in secret rehab. So forget down-and-out; this is down-and-up. That friend, Joan McAllister (a spectacularly over-the-top turn by the exquisite Judy Davis), is seen as one of only two who doesn't abandon Molly in her hour of need. The other is her gay designer pal Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos). The message, apparently, is that one need be an alcoholic or a homosexual to be fully human -- though we know it's only a matter of time before Molly's best pal, Cricket Stewart (Miranda Otto), comes to her senses and stops shunning her. Than again, trying to scrutinize motives is fairly futile in "Wife." As demonstrated in the sassy, somewhat stereotype-riddled teleplay by Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott, the five-parter (it kicks off with a two-hour and then plays for an hour over four subsequent Thursdays in June) is far more interested in being a lighthearted romp than a serious character study. Sometimes, however, those themes clash, the outrageous moments sometimes awkwardly intertwining with far more weighty themes. One of those is embodied in a big-time Hollywood mogul named Lou Manahan (smartly played by dependable Joe Mantegna), whose charismatic overtures draw Molly's romantic interest but whose demons lead him down a tragic path. This side journey is dismissed in an almost perfunctory way. Veteran director/exec producer Jon Avnet brings all of his lensing skills to bear here, shooting the project with assured flair and making his leading lady look ravishing even when she's dressing down. (To Messing's immense credit, she allows herself to appear frumpy at times and pokes fun at the whole concept of actress body-image issues.) This is like a good page-turner in that it's never less than energetic, witty and a kick to watch, though the depiction of Hollywood superficiality and excess is too broad and cartoony to make much of a larger point about female empowerment. It's more like, "I am woman, hear me whine." &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

On his second day as prosecution witness, Deputy Coroner Louis Pena reasserted the jury that the death was a homicide. When cross questioned by defense lawyer, Pena reaffirmed that presence of gun residue on the victimâs hand does not necessarily mean that she shot herself. He even explained how gun residue could drop on a person when heâs being shot by somebody, by putting his hands around his face and chest. "There are two ways to look at it. It implies the person could have been holding the weapon or been in the vicinity when the weapon was discharged," Pena said. He also told the defense lawyer that even the person who has the gun in hand may not have traces of gun powder after the shot. The prosecution witness disclosed that after examining Clarksonâs body he discovered bruises on her tongue, her right arm and hand which brings out a possibility that she was being threatened with a gun in her mouth and was under the pressure of her murderer. When cross questioned by the defense lawyer about the possibility of the presence of the bruise on the tongue due to the gunshot, the doctor answered that such occurrence was ânot normally seenâ. He also added that there was no way to confirm how fresh the bruises were considering the fact that Lana took a lot of pain medications. He also said that while collecting evidence they found large amount of Clarksonâs blood in the left pocket of Spectorâs pants which suggests that the gun had been placed in the pocket and was also wiped. Being asked to analyze the entire situation, Pena disclosed that he had a different picture of Clarkson in mind. All that he could gather from various sources about her is that she was a hopeful person and had no records of suicide attempts or depression. He also added that a suicide with purse on one shoulder at a strangerâs place was a rare possibility and it is a simple case of murder. "It bothered me a lot that she had her purse on her right shoulder," Pena said yesterday. "It's difficult for someone to take a weapon and shoot herself with the purse staying on her shoulder. It should be off." Defense attorney Christopher Plourd also asked him if there was a possibility that the handbag stayed on her shoulder due to a self inflicted wound. Pena confirmed the possibility but added that the circumstantial and physical analysis made him reach the conclusion that the death was a homicide. The defense attorney tried to shoot down the witnesses stand by saying that it was only once in the court that the forensic expert mentioned the significance of the purse and it was not mentioned anywhere in his reports or notes to which the doctor agreed but insisted that he mentioned it in a meeting once before. When asked about any mistakes that Penaâs team made during the investigation, he answered that one of his dental investigators lost one of Clarksonâs teeth which was kept in a vial. Pena was given a taped vial, which seemed to have been assembled after breakage and wasnât told about the incident for several months. "There were three vials collected to be examined by the odontologist," Pena said. "What happened is on review in meeting with the odontologist he admitted he broke one of the vials and the tooth fragment was lost. It flew around the room somewhere." He also told the jury that the dental investigator sealed the vial again but the fragment was never found. He also conceded that Clarksonâs body was moved in a wrong manner which caused blood to flow out of her mouth making it difficult to evaluate her dress for blood spatter. Forensic expert Henry Lee, was also under the doubt umbrella as a retired sheriff's investigator who worked for Spector's initial attorney told the court he saw Lee hold a piece of fingernail in a handkerchief at the time of inspection of the scene in an earlier hearing. The prosecutor confirmed the incident by showing the jury a photograph of the actressâs bloodstained right hand, which showed that part of her acrylic thumbnail was missing. According to prosecution this finding directly pointed towards a rift that must have happened between Spector and Lana before the killing. They also hinted that the defense hid the evidence to save their case. The defense lawyer cross questioned the doctor all morning and also asked a lot of questions on defense experts Vincent DiMaio and Werner Spitz, whose textbook Pena was consulting during the investigation. The testimony will resume tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Harvey Phillip Spector, 67, is accused of shooting actress Lana Clarkson, 40, through the mouth on 03 February 2003 early morning in his mansion. Spector who is presently free on $1-million bail, on the other hand claims that Lana committed suicide. Spector, 67, the American musician songwriter and record producer will face 15 years of life imprisonment if convicted of murder. Actress Lana Clarkson was famous for her notable performance in the movie Barbarian Queen. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

We&#39;re referring to Monday&#39;s competition, of course. Where usually a Miss Universe competition is an excuse for the world&#39;s most dumbly pretty bubbleheads to trot up and down a walkway and pretend that they&#39;ve ever had a single thought that wasn&#39;t exclusively about themselves in an attempt to win a big piece of ribbon, this year things were different. That&#39;s because this year , America&#39;s contestant in Miss Universe, fell over and was then booed relentlessly when she had to try and address the Mexican audience. The Miss Universe booing incident is now being played off as a political matter, based on the USA&#39;s draconian immigration policy - but that&#39;s missing the real point here. The real point, should you need telling, is that booing people who are prettier than you is probably the best thing in all the world. There must have been a point in time where a beauty queen was a genuinely aspirational thing to become. Not any more, though - the majority of women have either realised that beauty contests are nothing more than outmoded efforts to undermine female accomplishments in an ultimately patriarchal society, or they&#39;ve worked out that they can totally get a bunch more money if they fuck blokes on the internet for a living. That has left the beauty queen talent pool so shallow that even drunk nymphomaniac drug abusers like Miss USA Tara Conner can have a real shot at winning. Or, alternatively, people who can&#39;t walk down a simple piece of floor without falling over like a ninny, like Miss USA Rachel Smith. Rachel Smith represented the USA in Monday&#39;s Miss Universe contest. Obviously the biggest news about Miss Universe was that it was won by yet another Earth girl - Miss Japan - following last year&#39;s win by But while we&#39;d usually be taking this time to pass on our commiserations to all the other planets in the universe who have been cruelly shut out of the Miss Universe title again, this year we&#39;ve decided it&#39;d be much more fun to look at all the abuse that Miss USA Rachel Smith got from the crowd of Mexicans she was trying to impress. Rachel Smith&#39;s Miss Universe woes were twofold on Monday; not only did she fall over in front of everyone, but she also attempted to give a speech to an auditorium of angrily booing Mexicans. The treatment of Miss USA has kicked off a huge debate in America about whether Smith was booed because she&#39;s an idiot who can&#39;t even stand up properly or because she represents a country with strongly anti-Mexican immigration policy. Miss Universe co-owner thinks he knows the answer: "I don&#39;t think they are booing because of Rachel. They are booing because of the immigration policy." Following his statement Donald Trump then went into a 45-minute-long abusive rant about Rosie O&#39;Donnell because there was a camera there and that&#39;s what he just assumes people wants to hear these days. But, for all the ensuing arguments and self-exploration that the Miss Universe booing of Miss USA has started, perhaps the people of Mexico are onto something with this method of protest. We can&#39;t be alone in thinking that all international disputes would be better solved if pretty girls in bikinis from each country walked up and down a catwalk until everything was sorted out. Also, we think that Rosie O&#39;Donnell would probably be more in favour of the Iraq War if this was the case.

Maybe the soccer players were prettier than the fans in Mexico City when the chanted May 31st, 2007 at 2:08 pm You&#8217;re a fuckin loser dude!! Commenting on such a stupid event!! May 31st, 2007 at 2:17 pm This is old news. Show me a mexican that pays taxes and I&#8217;ll listen to his argument. Otherwise, go rake my lawn and plant my pagonias. Riyo Mori is smokin hot, go Asian! May 31st, 2007 at 2:20 pm What a cruel person you are, you so-called writer. Just because you can type and put some words together, doesn&#8217;t mean you should use them in order to put down another person, especially a person who is trying to do something in this world. There is absolutely no excuse for being lousy to people and that fact is lost on this writer, and those crummy Mexicans in the audience. We should not let those Mex&#8217;s into our country at all, let them wallow in their own feces. May 31st, 2007 at 2:20 pm The writer of this article is as anti-american as those in the Mexican audience booing Miss Universe. Regarding &#8220;bubble headedness&#8221; the writer should look in the mirror. May 31st, 2007 at 2:21 pm Ugly women,nasty men and shity beer,what would you expect form a bunch of low life third world idiots.fuck i say May 31st, 2007 at 2:28 pm Don&#8217;t mistake me for being anti-U.S., and I understand that a lot of Mexico is unfriendly to the U.S., but the problem wasn&#8217;t just political. The contest was in Mexico, but it was obvious that the show was a U.S. production. Ms. Mexico was excluded from the final five, yet Ms. USA, who had fallen on stage and was nowhere near as good looking as Ms. Mexico was advanced. The Mexican crowd saw a problem with the judges. Anyone who watched had to be scratching their heads&#8230; or booing. May 31st, 2007 at 2:54 pm &#8220;Draconian immigration policy&#8221;? What planet are you from? The US has the most liberal immigration policy of any nation on this planet! We accept more legal immigrants and tolerate more illegal immigrants than any other nation. You want draconian, look at f**king Mexico&#8217;s immigration laws. May 31st, 2007 at 3:07 pm Well, I for one was happy to read this. I&#8217;m SICK of Bush and his gang getting their own corrupt way in everything. I live in Okinawa where Americans are about as popular as a dead cat in a wedding. Why? Individual Americans are fine. Their politics is reminiscent of the 3rd Reich. In my opinion, the animosity has less to do with immigration policy than Herr Bush and his gang running over everything. Why does the &#8220;World Bank&#8221; have to have an American at the top? Americans invaded Iraq. Let&#8217;s not forget that. They started this war on what has since proved to be a pack of lies. I&#8217;m happy they didn&#8217;t win the beauty contest. There is no beauty there. May 31st, 2007 at 3:12 pm Obviously you have no concept of U.S. immigration policy nor what illegal immigration has done to the U.S. It is clear that you hate the U.S. May 31st, 2007 at 3:17 pm Your article is funny. I suspect you&#8217;re not intending this to be some grand discussion of US immigration policy, or foreign policy generally. It&#8217;s just meant be funny, and the responses make it even more amusing. Beauty contests and the U.S. are both ridiculous. May 31st, 2007 at 3:18 pm This article is perfect example of the bias in our media today. They try to make it appear that we are in the wrong about our immigration policy. They talk about all these poor mexican families. What they don&#8217;t tell you is the 33,000 gang mexican gang members that are illegally in the country, the California prisons that are bursting with illegal immigrants that have committed crimes or the fact the mexico promotes these people to come to our country so that they don&#8217;t have to provide social services for them. Instead we can pick up the bill! America is a country of laws and yet we provide get out of jail cards for people who arenât event citizens of this country? Your are anti-American. If you like Mexico then go live there! Wake up America!!!!! May 31st, 2007 at 3:22 pm its sad that people are still so ethnocentric. we believe that we as americans are so much higher than everyone including mexicans&#8230;and then we wonder why people around the world hate us so much&#8230;.. May 31st, 2007 at 3:26 pm Your obvious lack of knowledge, about the problems illegal immigaration are causing in the United States, is appaling. Please get a clue before you write anymore about things you obviously know nothing about. May 31st, 2007 at 3:34 pm Isn&#8217;t Rachel Smith part Mexican? I know she&#8217;s mixed, but don&#8217;t know what of. At any rate, &#8220;USA&#8217;s draconian immigration policy&#8221;,&#8221;strongly anti-Mexican immigration policy&#8221;???! Huh? What the heck are they talking about? They&#8217;re practically our special guests here in America. Sure, now that we&#8217;ve moaned and groaned about illegals they are doing some sort of token border patrol but it&#8217;s no where near where it should be. What about Mexicans immigration policy? Could I goto Mexico illegally and collect welfare, vote, deal drugs and demand citizenship? I don&#8217;t think so. Maybe we should have booed Miss Mexico for their draconian immigration policy. May 31st, 2007 at 3:45 pm The author, Stuart Heritage, seemed to miss his own point about the Miss Universe pagent. He shows contempt for the pagent, the contestants (especially Miss USA), Donald Trump, and the USA. For some reason thought he showed no contempt for the country that hosted the event, Mexico, or the people that payed money to be in the audience, mostly Mexicans. Mr. Heritage seems to have a problem with the objectification of women yet he feels no compashion for the women being objectified. I have always felt that the Mexicans in the USA are just here to earn a decent living and provide for there families and I have absolutly nothing against that. I have also believed that imigration is good for the USA, historically spikes in imigration have caused spikes in the economy. But this isn&#8217;t so for Mexican imagrants because they use and abuse our system and our generosity. I know why President Bush wants to keep the status quo but why is it that liberals want to maiintain Illegal imigration. Do they truly believe we should open our borders to anyone that wants to come into the USA. Is there a single country in the world that does that, I don&#8217;t think so? Since this debate has started I have been shocked at the hateful comments of Mexicans and it is they that have formed my new opinion. Screw them they are ungreatful America haters and all illegals should be tossed out and required to come back legally. Or maybe they should clean up there own house first. If it wasn&#8217;t for the rampant corruption in Mexico it wouldn&#8217;t be a third world country anymore. That says something about the Mexican people and it isn&#8217;t good. I was in Mexico once and had to bribe the immigration officer to get in the country because he ripped up my perfectly good visa and demanded a bribe. I had to bribe a cop to leave me and my wife alone when all we were doing was having a meal in the same restuarant that these DRUNK police officers decided to come into. The owner also gave them a case of beer so that they would leave. Then I had to bribe another immigration officer to let me out of Mexico. They have made their country a shit hole and I think they should have to live in it. May 31st, 2007 at 3:50 pm &#8220;we as americans are so much higher than everyone including mexicans&#8221; - Proves the War on (some) Drugs isn&#8217;t working&#8230; 16 angry comments in 4 hours? Not bad Hecklerspray, keep up the good work. In fact, have a gold star. May 31st, 2007 at 3:51 pm I aggree with Paul - I&#8217;m not anti-american, but don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s fishy how the USA alwyas happens to run in the top 5 ?? out of how many other women?? PLEASE!!! and they saw how the AMreICAN pageant, put our USA lady in the top 5 after she tripped yet MISS MEXICO didn&#8217;t make it and she walked without falling. So, if they booed because it&#8217;s political, then i say, why not? i don&#8217;t blame them. May 31st, 2007 at 4:00 pm Typical liberal ranting is all i got out of this little piece of crap article.And as far as the guy from Okinowa is concerned, you really should do a little checking of history in lets say the last 60 years. You do know that the Japanese have a history as some of the most brutal and racist people to ever walk this planet. I think all you have to do is look at what they did throughout asia and the south pacific prior to ww2. Brutal to say the least.As far as your histrionics about the Bush administration are concerned the &#8220;lies you speak of were accepted as factual by the world and the united nations. Do your homework and try to operate withsome intellect and not so much on emotions. People will take you allittle more seriosly May 31st, 2007 at 4:05 pm Great article/column, especially for its ability to bring out so much political rancor from so many of your readers! I agree with &#8220;Paul&#8221; that the audience was booing the judges&#8217; decision to allow a less pretty (and pretty clumsy) Miss USA into the finals while excluding Miss Mexico. I also agree with Julia Goulia that your column was very funny; I laughed out loud a few times. It&#8217;s too bad so many of your readers can&#8217;t recognize sarcasm & satire.

The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, sold Wednesday to a private European buyer at Christie&#039;s sale of film and entertainment memorabilia. The auction house said it had expected the dress to sell for up to $30,000 (&#8364;22,000). "The sale was filled with iconic pieces," said Helen Hall, Christie&#039;s head of entertainment memorabilia. "It captured people&#039;s imagination." Hall said the auction house was pleased with the results of the sale, which brought in $1.2 million (&#8364;890,000). Other items on the block included Marilyn Monroe&#039;s script for "Something&#039;s Got To Give," with the actress&#039; handwritten notes, which sold for $19,200 (&#8364;14,300).

Reilly, one of the few openly gay performers of his generation, died of complications from pneumonia at a Los Angeles hospital overnight on Friday, Dawn Altyn, a spokeswoman for the actor's one-man show said. Reilly's health had been declining for about a year, Altyn said. He was 76. He last performed his autobiographical show, "Save It For the Stage: The Life of Reilly" in 2004, and a filmed version of the show is due to be released to theaters in October. Reilly won a Tony Award in 1962 for his role in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" and was nominated again in 1964 for "Hello, Dolly!" and in 1997 for directing "The Gin Game." He also received multiple Emmy Award nominations over his five-decade television career, but it was his lengthy turn as a game show panelist on "The Match Game" and "Hollywood Squares" that made him a pop culture fixture. The bespectacled, pipe-smoking actor cruised the edge of 1970s TV propriety with his double-entendres about his openly gay persona. He later speculated that being a game show panelist had hurt his acting career. He also was known for his roles in the 1970s in two children's programs, "Lidsville" and "Uncle Croc's Block" and the TV series "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir." In the early 1990s, he directed several episodes of the TV series "Evening Shade," and in the past few years performed the voice of The Dirty Bubble for the hit cartoon series "SpongeBob SquarePants." The Bronx-born Reilly is survived by his longtime partner, Patrick Hughes. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

While I'm not a fan of Trump, he definitely called it - once you face Ro head on she backs down like the coward that she called EH. He even said that EH shredded her to pieces-which she did. The split screen pushed her over the top - what kind of lame ass excuse is that ?? Oh and by the way Ro - did Joy defend your "who are the terrorist" comment ?? I don't remember that... why didn't you call her a coward ?? Because she is your Democrat buddy, huh??? You have truly gone over the edge and I hope I never see your mug on TV again.

The agreement, announced Wednesday, came after an extensive auction attracted interest from private equity investors and Universal Music Group, The New York Times reported. Sony-ATV is a partnership between Sony and the singer Michael Jackson. Famous Music, Viacom's worldwide music publishing division, is a publishing catalog with rights to roughly 125,000 songs, ranging from "Moon River" to " Hips Don't Lie." Its stable of songwriters include Akron and Shakier. Viacom, which operates cable channels such as MTV and Nickelodeon, put it up for auction after concluding the catalog wasn't a core asset. Famous' catalog also includes film scores, such as themes from "The Godfather" and "Beverly Hills Cop." Viacom took over the business as part of its acquisition of the Paramount movie studio. Sony has been in the market for publishing catalogs, which generate income when their songs are used in television shows or films, played on the radio or recorded.

But I love the movie so much, I decided to do a couple of follow-up questions with him during the recent junket MGM held in honor of the film. In the movie, Costner plays a man addicted to killing. He even goes to AA meetings to curb his appetite for destruction. Here's what else he had to say about his character... Why the decision to do something so dark and sinister? : The decision was pretty simple. I thought the writing was the star of the movie. And while I didn't see myself like that person, I thought, "I could do this." Even though you have to professionally cover movies, I'm sure deep down you love movies and probably love movies when they surprise you. On paper, I thought this movie had all of those moments if we embraced them and went for them. I understood that it would be seen as a departure. I understood all of the things that would come with it, but I still felt like, "If I'm going to make a life of making movies, then I should try to make different movies." And this seemed to fit in a positive way. Did you ever think about directing : I thought about that, but when I realized what the pedigree of the project was, and that the writers who wrote it wanted to direct it, we had a discussion about that. I could've done that, but in this instance it was important for Evans to direct. I've worked with a lot of first-time directors and writer-directors, and I thought, "I'll give this a chance". You always knew that you were going to be a producer? : I knew that. I knew that without a doubt I would have [to produce]. I also knew that I would have to have final cut on it because the... odd things about the movie I knew would be the things that would be cut first. If you don't like blood, blood would be gone. If you don't like "this", "this" would be gone. They ask audiences, "What do you like?" "I don't like this." But I thought that this piece was dark. It's insidious, even though we find ourselves laughing at some moments - the oddity of it. I felt that it needed to be true to itself. And if no one else wanted to make this movie and I wanted to make it, why would I let anybody try to flatten in out and make it more generic? So while I know some longtime [fans] who've enjoyed my movies might be offended by this, might think it's too harsh... I get that, and I accept that. But I don't want to cater to my audience; I just want to feed it. Take it or not take it. It's an honest effort. Were you familiar with Dane Cook's standup before working with him in this? : I wasn't familiar with his standup, and I'm actually glad because I don't completely understand his standup. (Laughter) But I understand him, and I understand his desire to not be pigeonholed or be conformed. He read for me. He read for this movie. He did all the things that someone who has a bigger idea about their career does. That's why he got the part. And he was sensational in it. Do you think there's a little bit of Mr. Brooks in yourself? : The things that we all see in Mr. Brooks are that we would all go defend our daughter, that we would go kill for them. Mr. Brooks isn't looking for forgiveness. "Don't you see that I'm a nice guy?" No, he's not. He has a disease. When that disease isn't working, he is a nice guy. But the families that he's dismantled, both the ones that have died and the boat wake that comes after, that kind of thing where families are destroyed forever... we don't really deal with that. That's why we can't ever forgive him. But where Mr. Brooks is successful, I think, is that it creates a certain kind of empathy. And empathy always comes in our life when we have a level of understanding. You may not like the serial killer, may never forgive him, he destroyed your girlfriend's life forever. You might know him, and know that he was assaulted and abused since he was three-years-old. You can't forgive him then either, and you can't say anything to her, but in your heart you go, "That poor fucker never had a chance". You have empathy because you have a level of understanding of him. In movies, we can create a level of understanding if we choose to invest in the character, and that's what made Mr. Brooks stand out to me as a serial killer movie. Because I don't like serial killer movies; I don't like scary movies. I get scared. I don't like roller coasters and shit like that. I don't like being scared. It's not an adrenaline rush for me. So Mr. Brooks really had to pass a lot of things for me to even want to be a part of it. And it did. Were you ever afraid that the character of Marshall would dominate the movie? : I knew it was a really flashy role, and I very often take movies that have scene-stealing roles all around me. And I relish that. I think it's important for movies, and I don't get scared by that stuff. I encourage the actors to be really good around me. I want that to happen, and I want them to do it inside the lines of the movie. So when I see a great role, I want to go after a great actor. A great actor recognizes a great role. It raises the level of the whole movie. William Hurt has a pleasing role, and sometime the temptation in American movies now, the conventional wisdom is that they'll ask you what scenes you hated the most. Then they'll ask you what scenes you liked the most. In modern day filmmaking, that scene that you hated the most will go flying out of the movie, but that doesn't mean it should've. It gives the movie a balance. They might ask you about characters, and you'll say, "Well, I really like Marshall the most." Then the executives go, "Let's write some more scenes for Marshall!" I think Marshall is in there just perfectly. Just perfectly. How was it playing opposite William Hurt. : It was fun. I've known William because of . We're both rehearsal oriented actors, and writer-driven actors. It fit into our game really nicely. Is Marshall based on a person from Mr. Brooks' past? : Yes. I found Marshall when I was twelve-years-old in a book of children's dreams, and he would play the black knight, an evil person. But I liked him in the book because he was kind of cool. I liked him so much that I was afraid he was going to die in the book, so I never finished it. And my father used to discipline me with the idea that, if I wasn't good, the black knight would come and get me, that he actually hid in my closet. And like any young man, I eventually challenged my dad's theory and opened that closet, and there was my imaginary friend. And he was not scary at all to me. So he's been with me as my alter-ego. Bruce Evans had directed only one film prior to . What did he do to convince you that he could accomplish this visually? : Well, I didn't look at his other movie. I didn't want to because, once I committed to him as a director, I wanted to try to support him, and I didn't want to get panicked. I mean, I'd heard different things, but I didn't want to jade that. Once I gave him my word that he would get a chance to direct it, I wanted to back that up. But I also wanted to protect the movie with final cut. What do you look for when you're reading scripts? : Just fresh air. Just something that seems highly original. I would never do this movie it was pitched to me. But I would never have done if it was pitched to me. It takes a writer that really has his muse working on his shoulder, and you go, "Wow, this is an incredible window they've found into this subject." For instance, I thought was great. The window into that story was Kenny O'Donnell, not Jack's point of view or Bobby's point of view. It's hard to write. It's an art form. When you write, where do you look for inspiration? : It just comes to me. I don't consider myself a great writer, but I feel like I recognize a great idea, and I feel like I protect great writing. I think that's my talent. In that sense, do you think great writing isn't respected in Hollywood? : I don't think it is. The minute you're willing to ask an audience what they think about the movie, then nobody cares about the writing; you care what [the audience] thinks. But unlike conventional wisdom, I don't go out and make a movie when the script is sixty-percent just because I got the actor and the director and I think the job's done. I'm anal. I don't go out to actors until my script is 100% done because I don't want anybody changing it. Annette Bening and Robert Duvall didn't change a line on . Why? Because I was sure that it worked. William Hurt, Dane Cook and I... we didn't change any lines in our half of the movie because I was positive it worked. Yeah, there's blood. There's a lot of blood. That's what this movie was about. But there's a lot of tenderness, too. What is everybody so afraid of? Not being number one at the box office? Well, we aren't going to be. We're not even going to be close. But we can be a movie that's so true to itself that you might want to take a friend back to it. Or you might never want to see it again because of what it is. But it might speak so loudly to somebody, they'll tell a friend "I want you to see this movie." And I'm proud that those elements are in there that would drive you back to it. I think it has classiness. Can you say anything about the western you're working on now, and will you be using the same editor from : I'll probably use the same guy. It's just a good cowboy movie. It's about friendship. There's a code. It's written; it's 100-percent done. I'm not sure... people aren't dying to make westerns. I'll just have to figure out how to make it. I'll have to mortgage something else. (Laughs) Do you think there's a killer gene as posited in this movie? : I don't really know. You hear about alcoholism being passed on, and genes and stuff like that. I think we're a generation that's just learning about what gets passed on. Our eyes are opening every day as to what... I mean, just about the time we think a protein diet is the right one, somebody goes, "So wrong!" Every diet, somebody's like "Wrong!" four years later. There's too many of us in the city. There's too many of us... look, it's weird out there. We're all like some number. One out of somebody gets assaulted, and women have it worse. It's like, "What the fuck?" We're like a percentage of something going bad somewhere. It's terrible. Are you surprised that Brian De Palma is going back to make an prequel, and do you have any thoughts on Nicolas Cage playing Al Capone or who should play Malone? : No. I don't think about it at all. I think about it now because you brought it up. It was a seminal film for you. : It was a very important film to me, and it was very important to Brian. I'm not surprised that they've circled back to it to squeeze some more out of it. opens nationwide on June 1st.

( Paramount Pictures France) &#039;Knocked Up&#039;: Rowdy, sad and very funny By A. O. Scott Published: May 31, 2007 Directed by Judd Apatow (U.S.) It may be a bit, um, premature to say so, but Judd Apatow&#039;s "Knocked Up" strikes me as an instant classic, a comedy that captures the sexual confusion and moral ambivalence of our moment without straining, pandering or preaching. Like "The 40 Year Old Virgin," Apatow&#039;s earlier film, it attaches dirty humor to a basically upright premise. While this movie&#039;s barrage of gynecology-inspired jokes would have driven the prudes at the old Hays Office mad, its story, about a young man trying to do what used to be the very definition of the Right Thing, might equally have brought a smile of approval to the lips of the starchiest old-Hollywood censor. The wonder of "Knocked Up" - which is being released Friday in the United States and in Asia and Europe beginning in July - is that it never scolds or sneers. It is sharp but not mean, sweet but not soft, and for all its rowdy obscenity, it rarely feels coarse. What it does feel is honest - about love, about sex, and above all about the built-in discrepancies between what men and women expect from one another and what they are likely to get. Starting, as he did in "Virgin," from a default position of anti-romantic cynicism, Apatow finds an unlikely route back into romance, a road that passes through failure and humiliation on its way toward comic bliss. This improbable - and improbably persuasive - love story is embedded in what looks at first glance like a nest of sitcom clich&#233;s. The central would-be couple, Ben and Allison, represents the kind of schlub-babe pairing seen more frequently on television than anywhere else. Tall, blond and lovely, Allison (Katherine Heigl) has just been promoted to an on-air job at the E! cable network when she meets Ben (Seth Rogen) at a nightclub. He is a pudgy, unkempt stoner who lives with a group of goofball pals. Their ratty communal apartment doubles as the headquarters of their nascent Internet enterprise, a Web site that will collect and catalogue movie scenes in which famous actresses appear naked. But Ben is friendly and unpretentious, and it does not entirely defy belief when Allison, beer goggles firmly in place, takes him home to bed. Or, rather, to her sister&#039;s house, where she sleeps in a spare room. The sister, Debbie (played by the brilliant Leslie Mann, Apatow&#039;s wife), is on hand to send darts of envy and disapproval in Alison&#039;s direction, and also, along with her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), to incarnate both the ideal and the nightmare of heterosexual domesticity. Debbie is relentlessly critical, Pete is emotionally withdrawn, and together they dwell in a paradoxical state in which fulfillment - two charming young daughters, a big house with a pool, each other - seems indistinguishable from disappointment. A rare glimpse of 19th-century Iran For Lohan, a mix of sympathy and scorn Kiefer: An artist with monumental force There is, as I&#039;ve suggested, a certain familiarity to much of this. But Apatow has a sly way of subverting these familiar touchstones. When one of Ben&#039;s sperm hits the reproductive jackpot, the stage seems to be set for a comedy of male panic. But that&#039;s not quite how "Knocked Up" plays. Rather than being afraid of commitment, Ben appears fascinated by the idea. When he learns that Alison has decided to keep the baby, he seems genuinely delighted. Alison is somewhat more hesitant, not about the incipient child, but about staying with Seth, whose hold on maturity is less sure than his grip on his favorite bong. What Alison doesn&#039;t realize - partly because he doesn&#039;t quite either - is that Seth wouldn&#039;t mind changing, if only he could figure out how. At a moment of crisis, Seth calls his father, played by Harold Ramis, to ask for advice, but no help is forthcoming. ("I&#039;ve been divorced three times. Why are you asking me?"). The absence of a credible model of male adulthood is clearly one of the forces trapping Seth and his friends in their state of blithe immaturity. Apatow&#039;s critique of contemporary mores is easy to miss but it is nonetheless severe, and directed at the young men who make up the core of this film&#039;s likely audience. The culture of sexual entitlement and compulsive consumption encourages men to remain boys, for whom women serve as bedmates and babysitters. I realize that much of what I have said about it makes "Knocked Up" sound like a pretty heavy picture, pregnant (sorry!) with seriousness and social significance. But since the birth of the talkies, the best American movie comedies have always managed both to confront grave matters and to defy their own gravity.

http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965916.html%3Fcategoryid%3D14&cid Variety.com - Fox 'Lot' scores little Blog: Wilshire & Washington Blog: The Down Low Cynthia Littleton On The Air Variety On The Town Smith: In New York Posted: Tue., May 29, 2007, 10:40am PT Fox 'Lot' scores little Show finishes fifth in regular timeslot Fox reality show 'On the Lot' placed fifth among broadcast nets Monday. Fox's unscripted Hollywood competish "On the Lot" bowed in its regular timeslot Monday night to a fifth-place finish among the broadcasters. After failing to ignite much interest with a pair of preview episodes last week -- including one following the final "American Idol" performance show of the season -- the search for the next great film director settled for fewer than 3 million viewers. Of course, Memorial Day isn't a great night to kick off a series, and Fox can hope that its audience grows from here. But the net could be forced to yell "Cut!" if numbers remain at this level -- which are low even by summer standards. Based on preliminary same-day Nielsen nationals for Monday, "On the Lot" averaged a 1.3 rating/4 share in adults 18-49 and 2.9 million viewers overall from 8 to 10 p.m., peaking with about 3.1 million from 8:30 to 9. Those numbers left the net behind repeats on CBS as well as firstrun programming on ABC, NBC and Univision; Fox also may have trailed a cabler or two in the 9 o'clock hour. Show's regular airing pattern is an hour on Monday, followed by a "box office" results show Tuesday. Elsewhere Monday, ABC's new limited-run series "Ex-Wives Club" (prelim 2.0/5 in 18-49, 5.3 million viewers overall) placed third at 9 o'clock, airing behind a slot-leading original episode of "Wife Swap" (prelim 2.3/7, 6.3 million). This repped a slight improvement over last year's "How to Get the Guy," which bowed on a Monday in June. NBC's coverage of "The Miss Universe Pageant" settled for a prelim 2.4/7 in 18-49, and 7.1 million viewers overall from 9 to 11 p.m. -- down 25% from last year's July airing and believed to be the pageant's lowest numbers in at least 20 years. It didn't get much help from its lackluster lead-in -- an original episode of reality series "The Real Wedding Crashers" (prelim 1.5/5 in 18-49, 4.1 million). With firstrun fare struggling on other nets, CBS cleaned up by claiming the top three programs of the night with repeats of "Two and a Half Men" (prelim 3.4/9 in 18-49, 10.7 million), "The King of Queens" (3.0/8, 8.8 million) and "CSI: Miami" (2.9/8, 9.4 million). Due to the Monday holiday, the primetime ratings report and charts for the week of May 21-27 will appear in Thursday's edition.

http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965939.html%3Fcategoryid%3D13&cid Variety.com - 'Pirates' treasure grows overseas Blog: Wilshire & Washington Blog: The Down Low Cynthia Littleton On The Air Variety On The Town Smith: In New York Posted: Tue., May 29, 2007, 4:37pm PT 'Pirates' treasure grows overseas Film's domestic tally dipped by $2.2 million 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' The treasure chest for Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" turned out to be fuller than expected when actual receipts from the Memorial Day holiday weekend were counted Tuesday. But while international B.O. edged up -- by $6 million, or 2% -- the pic's domestic tally dipped by $2.2 million. All told, global figures eked up 0.8% higher than the Mouse House had estimated, bringing the latest entry in the "Pirates" franchise to $404 million over six days rather than the $401 million the studio reported Monday. Mark Zoradi, prexy of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture marketing and distribution, said the uptick showed "Pirates" has "truly becoming a cultural phenomenon all over the world." "The global box office returns have continued to exceed our expectations and estimates," he added. Pic's perf has been particularly pumped by its overseas grosses, which account for 62% of the worldwide total. With that figure at $404 million, "Pirates" beat out the $382 million that "Spider-Man 3" earned over its first six days in release. But back here at home, "Pirates" numbers didn't completely live up to some of the outsized expectations of B.O. watchers handicapping Memorial Day weekend. Domestically, the movie's actual take was somewhat less than studio estimates: "Pirates" played to $139.8 million over the four days of Memorial weekend, Disney said, rather than $142 million. Pic still handily set the record for the Memorial Day frame, beating Fox's "X-Men: The Last Stand," which cracked $122.8 million last year. Overall domestic cume -- including limited Thursday runs of "Pirates" -- was $153 million, rather than the $156 million Disney estimated Monday. By comparison, "Spider-Man 3" opened to a three-day record of more than $151 million and has captured $307.6 million after a month in theaters. Internationally, "Pirates" set an overseas launch record with $251 million over six days, $19 million ahead of "Spider-Man 3" and up notably from Disney's $245 million estimate. Pic posted record-breaking openings in 17 territories, including Argentina, Ecuador, Holland, Iceland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, Panama, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine and Venezuela. Germany contributed significantly more than had been estimated Monday, with an increase of nearly $3 million to $22.9 million, trailing only the U.K. with $34.5 million. Other top hauls abroad came from France ($22 million), South Korea ($19.3 million), Japan ($18.4 million), Russia ($15.4 million), Spain ($13.2 million) and Australia ($10.5 million). "At World's End" still hasn't opened in two key markets -- India, where it launches Friday, and China, where it opens June 10. Sony took issue Tuesday with Disney's claim of a six-day record, asserting it should be counted as seven days, since BVI opened "At World's End" a day earlier than reported in France and Italy on May 22. BVI said in response that its "Pirates" biz on that day consisted of $1.2 million at 251 playdates from evening showings in France and $200,000 from previews in Italy. Still, Sony asserted "Spider-Man 3" should be given the record for grossing $418.1 million in its first seven days.

Sifting through the Lohan gossip may be kind of difficult, especially with her dad Michael Lohan's recent reports about his daughter's habits. But throughout all of dad's remarks, there may be some valuable information, especially regarding the exact drugs that are hurting Lindsay. Michael Lohan, in a discussion with today, said that Lindsay's addictions are primarily for alcohol and the painkiller OxyContin, surprising information given the recent media attention on the 20-year-old's cocaine and ecstacy binges. "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care," he said. "I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things." In the wake of Lindsay's car accident, the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is now investigating whether Lindsay, still underage to legally consume alcohol in the U.S., was served by bartenders. Perhaps the investigation is a little late, given the notorious underage drinking problem in America, but better late than never to start enforcing the law. Talk to other readers about this story.

News - Silver Surfer Coin Not So Fantastic - Jessica Alba Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News rise of the silver surfer Silver Surfer Coin Not So Wed, 30 May 2007 10:57:23 AM PDT They wanted unique. They got illegal. Not content to simply resign their promotions for Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer to the usual breakfast cereal and skywriting variety, the marketing brains at 20th Century Fox went outside the box&mdash;and, as it turns out, the law&mdash;and ingratiated the Silver Surfer onto some 40,000 U.S. quarters. Unfortunately, they forgot to tell the U.S. Mint. Fox first announced the unprecedented marketing move last week and unveiled the limited-edition coins to the press. While the front of the quarters, and George Washington&#39;s visage, remained unaltered, the reverse featured a full-color image of the Silver Surfer character, with the URL for the film&#39;s Website. The coins, which were distributed 800 per state prior to the Memorial Day weekend, were meant to encourage fans who found the quarters to log on to the site and enter to win prizes, including a trip for four to the film&#39;s London premiere. Unfortunately, the illegal tender&#39;s artwork, while creative, was carried out by the Franklin Mint without the cooperation, or even awareness, of the government, a point the U.S. Mint was quick to lambaste. "The promotion is in no way approved, authorized, endorsed, or sponsored by the United States Mint, nor is it in any way associated or affiliated with the United States Mint," the government said in a statement. The feds said they didn&#39;t know about the promotion until contacted by the media. While Fox has copped to launching the campaign without government approval, the studio maintains that it was unaware such sign-off was necessary. The studio released its own statement saying it did not intend to break the law or "suggest that there was any approval from the U.S. Mint or the U.S. government." The Franklin Mint, too, said it didn&#39;t mean any harm, calling the Silver Surfer quarters "commemorative coins like many the Franklin Mint creates on a regular basis for various properties. We were confident this coin followed the same procedures and guidelines but will certainly take any necessary steps if advised otherwise." It is a federal crime to turn any form of legal tender into a form of advertising, and violators can face a fine. Then again, the $10,000 in Silver Surfer coins that were distributed throughout the country, along with whatever fine may be assessed, will no doubt be less than what it would cost to generate the same amount of headline-grabbing publicity that the criminal coins have.

http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_6022447&cid Press-Telegram - Starting over By David Kronke, Staff Writer Article Launched: 05/31/2007 12:00:00 AM PDT GIGI LEVANGIE Grazer, the wife of Oscar-winning ber-producer Brian Grazer, knows a little bit about the pretensions and snippy mores of the privileged Brentwood crowd and has shared them with the world in her three novels about Hollywood. Her latest, "The Starter Wife," has now been made into a miniseries premiering tonight on the USA Network. In it, Debra Messing stars as Molly (the character was named Gracie in Grazer's novel, but Messing had already played a fairly iconic character named Grace), whose oily studio-executive husband dumps her for a newer model, spouses serving essentially as status accessories in Hollywood. He also gets custody of most of her friends - those who want to work in the industry again, that is. Decamped to a pal's home in Malibu, Molly must figure out how to reinvent herself and start a new life. Despite airing Tinseltown laundry, Grazer says, "I've somehow managed to stay friends with everyone. I'm not looking to destroy anyone. I do it with affection, by telling the truth, and believing people can improve ..." She pauses, a beat worthy of a comedian. "Much to my eternal disappointment." In fact, after each book, Grazer says acquaintances seek her out to share anecdotes potentially worthy of being incorporated in future works. "After my last book, a woman came up to me, scandalized - her husband was dating a 40-year-old woman from the Valley!" she reports with a mock shudder, then laughs. "That was the worst thing she could say about her." Jon Avnet, who directed "The Starter Wife," says, "Gigi has written a very good book that makes fun of people that I like and people that I don't like - and myself, as well." Grazer conceived "The Starter Wife" when she spied a woman recently divorced from a big star on a beach in Malibu, flirting with a hunky guy that Grazer knew was homeless. "I thought, `That's a novel.' " "It was sophisticated and the comedy was subversive, a little perverse, a little mocking of, you know, the Hollywood culture," notes Messing, who adds that there's something rather precise about the Hollywood wife. "I encounter them every single day in Los Angeles. There are high expectations for the wives of the power brokers, and there is a kind of look to the starter wife. There's the polished hair and the beautiful nails and the designer clothing and the white teeth and the, you know, very trim body." Of her character, Messing observes, "There's something very universal about what Molly goes through. It's incredibly painful seeing a woman who was so successful in her life as a partner and wife to this incredibly successful man and everything she contributed to his success, to be just discarded and to have all of the respect that had been hers with him sort of walk away with him. All the issues of identity and choices made - `Where am I going, and am I going to have a chance to do it again?' " Sad reality Grazer agrees that although the book and miniseries are set in Hollywood, their emotional core has a wide appeal. "I don't want to keep it just to Hollywood wives," she says. "It's a very real thing that women can go through - being dependent on the man they're with, financially dependent, socially dependent. There's a very real fear. I see it in my own life with people I know. It's a terrible thing to have to live with." Though Grazer receives an executive producer's credit on "The Starter Wife," she did not seek to work on the screenplay (that task went to Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon, whose big-screen credits include "Runaway Bride" and "Chicken Little"). Grazer, who reportedly wasn't enthused about her own foray into screenwriting ("Stepmom"), jokes about the devotion needed for such an enterprise. "Six hours of television - do you know how many meetings that translates into? How many trips on the 405?" she says, with a laugh. "Also, I have small children. You have to work too hard. I'm working on my next novel. I like my three-hour workdays." More seriously, she says, "Handing over your baby is fine if you hand over to people qualified to take care of it. And they were uniquely qualified. My ego was beaten out of me a long time ago in terms of protecting my writing. "I wasn't worried - and had good reason not to be. When I got the first draft of the first hour, I was immediately on board. They got the tone, and it's a difficult tone - it's light, it's airy, it's feminine, but the undertone is dark and questioning of the world we live in. And there are satirical bits and pieces - well, they're not satirical if you live in my neighborhood. I'm happy with the outcome. There'll be no lawsuits coming from me." Grazer's next book, due next spring, is titled "Queen Takes King," about another power couple divorcing. But her friends hoping - or fearing - to see themselves as doppelgangers in her next novel can rest easy - this one is set in New York. As for Messing's next project, well, after eight years on "Will & Grace," she's not anxious to be nailed down to another TV series anytime soon. "I just knew I needed some time to be a gypsy, as much as I absolutely loved having that job. I really am enjoying being able to wake up in the morning and not having to be anywhere and not having to do anything. Having that freedom is really wonderful, and it's revitalizing for me right now."

"The plans I have seen look incredibly exciting and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed," Rowling said of the Orlando park that is scheduled to open in 2009. The park is a joint venture between Warner Bros Entertainment, whose Potter films have so far grossed more than $3.5 billion (1.77 billion pounds) worldwide, and Universal Orlando Resort. In a statement rich in entertainment hyperbole, the builders of "The Wizarding World of Harry Potter" said they planned to "create the world's first immersive Harry Potter themed environment." Barry Meyer, chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment, said: "Over the years we've received thousands of letters from fans around the world wishing they could visit Hogwarts (School) and the wonderful locations described in each of J.K. Rowling's beloved stories." The park's opening could help to quell the withdrawal symptoms of Potter fans around the globe who have bought 320 million copies of her wizard tales and turned every one of the films into a box office hit. Pottermania is set to scale new heights in July with the last novel hitting the bookstands and the latest film being launched in a deluge of global publicity. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the final instalment in her hugely successful series, is being released on July 21. &copy; Reuters 2007.

You can be popular one day, unpopular the next, all depending upon your accouterments. And if you're one of that select segment of Hollywood society known as "wife of," the primary accouterment is your powerful husband -- preferably a producer, though a director may have to suffice. These are women who tweeze, squeeze and wax themselves into submission in order to marry into money, fame, power -- and, apparently, the mean girls' table at the best lunchrooms in town. Debra Messing, with Joe Mantegna, plays a Hollywood woman scorned in USA network's sudsy summer miniseries. (By Paul A. Broben -- Usa Network) Tune in to the shows coming to airwaves this summer with our premiere calendar. Save & Share Article But it's a precarious existence. Lose that man, and you might as well stop flat-ironing your hair. Fortysomething Molly Kagan (played by Debra Messing) learns this after she gets dumped by her power-producer husband via speakerphone and finds out that divorce, Hollywood-style, comes with a lot more than property settlements and custody battles. Suddenly, she's being shunned at six-figure children's birthday parties, can't get a table at the right restaurants and is no longer welcome at charity event-planning powwows. The twist behind "Starter Wife" is that it's based on a novel by a woman clearly poking fun at her own universe: Gigi Levangie Grazer, "wife of" Hollywood titan Brian Grazer. She somehow managed to satirize those around her, get a bestseller out of it, and not end up a starter wife herself. With Messing as the lead and the fabulous Judy Davis, martini glass in hand, playing one of her inner circle, the casting far exceeds the bar for a summer cable miniseries. And the slick skewering of Hollywood's foibles is quite fun . . . for a while. Alas, the story takes a quick detour and becomes something akin to "Desperate Housewives" living in "The O.C." Molly flees to a borrowed Malibu manse for the summer. From that point on, the plotlines head straight for the suds. A potential murder! A wacky attempt to spring a friend from rehab! A new potential love interest with a murky past and no platinum credit cards (to put it mildly)! Peter Jacobson plays Molly's soon-to-be-ex, the kind of guy who thinks it's perfectly fine to screen "Jaws" for his 5-year-old right before she goes to live at the beach. He's already replaced Molly with pop-tart Shoshanna (Trilby Glover), much to his starter wife's horror. Besides Davis, Molly's pals include Miranda Otto as Cricket, who truly has a heart of gold (a fact we're supposed to know from the start because she has a Brangelina-like brood of adopted children). Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos), a gay interior designer, completes the foursome. Diamantopoulos isn't great, but then again, when your subplot involves trying to unload a set of ugly chairs, there isn't much to work with. It's talents like Messing (who is more likable and less shrill here than she was in "Will & Grace") and Davis who save this six-hour miniseries from disaster. Not that the network doesn't do its best to drive viewers away with abundant (and abundantly annoying) product placement. A drinking game that required viewers to take a shot every time a brand-name item is blatantly mentioned would be lethal. We'd list some of the offenders here, but they're already getting their two seconds of fame. And the major tie-in with a particular line of beauty products that are supposed to keep us looking younger? Talk about a reverse effect. All that cringing it induces can't be good for the crow's feet. Then again, it's kind of nice to see a summer beach cast with a few crow's feet of their own. airs its first two hours tonight at 9 on USA Network. It continues over the next four Thursday nights.

The publicist wouldn&#039;t provide details, but several celebrity news outlets, including TMZ.com and Us Weekly magazine online, said Lohan checked in to the Promises treatment center in Malibu, California, the luxury facility where was recently a patient.

In that segment Kevorkian could be seen administering the lethal injection that resulted in the charges against him. That Wallace, 89, has not lost his zest for a big "get" was obvious in a phone interview this week, as he described securing the Kevorkian meeting through an intermediary and then plotting how to outwit others seeking the same interview.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Fri, May. 25, 2007 Boy Bags Hog Said Bigger Than 'Hogzilla' In this photo released by Melynne Stone, Jamison Stone, 11, poses with a wild pig he killed near Delta, Ala., May 3, 2007. Stone's father says the hog weighed a staggering 1,051 pounds and measured 9-feet-4 from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. If claims of the animal's size are true, it would be larger than ``Hogzilla,'' the huge hog killed in Georgia in 2004. (AP Photo/Melynne Stone) MONTGOMERY, Ala. - Hogzilla is being made into a horror movie. But the sequel may be even bigger: Meet Monster Pig. An 11-year-old boy used a pistol to kill a wild hog his father says weighed a staggering 1,051 pounds and measured 9 feet 4, from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. Think hams as big as car tires. If the claims are accurate, Jamison Stone's trophy boar would be bigger than Hogzilla, the famed wild hog that grew to seemingly mythical proportions after being killed in south Georgia in 2004. Hogzilla originally was thought to weigh 1,000 pounds and measure 12 feet long. National Geographic experts who unearthed its remains believe the animal actually weighed about 800 pounds and was 8 feet long. Regardless of the comparison, Jamison is reveling in the attention over his pig. "It feels really good," Jamison said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. "It's a good accomplishment. I probably won't ever kill anything else that big." Jamison, who killed his first deer at age 5, was hunting with father Mike Stone and two guides in east Alabama on May 3 when he bagged Monster Pig. He said he shot the huge animal eight times with a .50-caliber revolver and chased it for three hours through hilly woods before finishing it off with a point-blank shot. Through it all, there was the fear that the animal would turn and charge them, as wild boars have a reputation for doing. "I was a little bit scared, a little bit excited," said Jamison, who lives in Pickensville on the Mississippi border. He just finished the sixth grade on the honor roll at Christian Heritage Academy, a small, private school. His father said that, just to be extra safe, he and the guides had high-powered rifles aimed and ready to fire in case the beast, with 5-inch tusks, decided to charge. With the animal finally dead in a creek bed on the 2,500-acre Lost Creek Plantation, a commercial hunting preserve in Delta, trees had to be cut down and a backhoe brought in to bring Jamison's prize out of the woods. It was hauled on a truck to the Clay County Farmers Exchange in Lineville, where Jeff Kinder said they used his scale, recently calibrated, to weigh the hog. Kinder's scale measures only to the nearest 10, but Mike Stone said it balanced one notch past the 1,050-pound mark. "It probably weighed 1,060 pounds. We were just afraid to change it once the story was out," he said. The hog's head is being mounted by Jerry Cunningham of Jerry's Taxidermy. Cunningham said the animal measured 54 inches around the head, 74 inches around the shoulders and 11 inches from the eyes to the end of its snout. "It's huge," he said. "It's just the biggest thing I've ever seen." Mike Stone is having sausage made from the rest of the animal. "We'll probably get 500 to 700 pounds," he said. Jamison, meanwhile, has been offered a small part in "The Legend of Hogzilla," a small-time horror flick based on the tale of the Georgia boar. The movie is holding casting calls with plans to begin filming in Georgia. Jamison is enjoying the newfound celebrity generated by the hog hunt, but he said he prefers hunting pheasants to monster pigs: "They are a little less dangerous." Associated Press writer Jay Reeves in Birmingham contributed to this report.

It is unclear whether she plans on using the experience to spruce up her admissions essay when and if she re-applies to Stanford, but I'd like to read that essay. 4) Real Estate Assets In what may be the most eye-catching wrongful termination since... well ever, a German real estate agent has been fired because of her desire to have the largest breasts in Europe. Annina Ulrich admits that since childhood she has been obsessed with enhancing her assets, but claims her boss did not understand that. According to the buxom 29-year-old her boss told her that "breast implants were not an asset and were damaging the company's image," even though customers apparently thought they were "great." Since being laid off, Ulrich has announced plans to open her own real estate agency complete with pictures of the 42-H breasts "on Marvel takes on Washington (AP) 3) Advertising Tail Spin In the latest guerrilla marketing tactic to run afoul of the law, 20th Century Fox, in collusion with The Franklin Mint, altered 40,000 U.S. quarters replacing the backside with an action shot of The Silver Surfer (see image), to hype their upcoming film "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer."

The centuries old tradition attracted participants from around the world, many of whom sustained injuries while in pursuit of a 7-8 pound Double Gloucester. According to three-time champion Jason Crowther, of West Wales, "[i]t was a bit slippery and I heard something crack, which I think was my knee ." Winners take home the wheel of cheese they were chasing, with $20 and $10 going to second and third place respectively. Softer conditions may have been responsible for the low number of serious injuries this year, with volunteer EMTs treating only 20 wounded chasers, compared to 34 last year. eBay Steal of the Week : For those of you in the market for a car with a really great story eBay is offering the actual hearse that carried President John F.

"Whether "In God We Trust" is an advertising vehicle for Christianity is anyone's call." I find it interesting that you needed to add that. It is also interesting that you feel the need to take a direct slam against Christianity. Then again, maybe you are not aware that Muslims, Buddhists, Hebrews, ... well just about all religions worship "God". You need to be a little more careful. Either your bias or your stupidity is showing. Posted by: SoMD AM To be fair, Muslims believe in Allah, Jews believe in Yahwe and Buddists believe in Zen, and Hindus believe in a whole managery of different dieties. Only Chistians believe in God by the name God.

Posted by: SoMD AM "a God Is a God, no matter what name you choose." Spoken like a Christian SoMD - no regard or knowledge about what anyone else believes, only your assumptions about it. Posted by: Mort | May 30, 2007 06:27 AM SoMD you're right. Randy Jo, you're wrong. If you want to be really technical about it, Christians believe in the Trinity - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit - nowhere is the word God found in there. Also, read this definition of God: 1 capitalized : the supreme or ultimate reality That pretty well seems to cover any belief, whether associated with religion or not, that can exist. God does not mean Christian. It's merely the English word for a concept that has existed in every civilization since the dawn of time. Mort - you're just plain stupid. Allah, Yahwe, Adonai, Krishna...etc. - they ALL mean God, just in different languages. God, the word by itself, as I showed above, carries no connotation of Christianity, merely an understanding that there is something greater than ourselves. Hell, you can even believe in God by the name of God if you don't belong to any religion at all. SoMD supported what he said, while you just throw a meaningless comment out there with no explanation as to your bitterness and religious affront to the word God. Posted by: Little Bull | May 30, 2007 09:58 AM I cant believe you guys are arguing about the god reference ... im pissed that there was no picture of the German chick with huge boobs. Posted by: Ned Mark | May 30, 2007 10:04 AM Actually Little Bull, your full of it. "God" is English for a Christian entity, that is why it is capitalized. It specifically refers to God, not Allah, or Krishna or Yaweh or, as it should, the concept of god generally, but the God of the Holy Bible. Judaism, for instance expressly prohibts the writing of Yahew's name, therefore it is at the very least anti-semetic. Further, no other faith calls the entity they worship God, therefore are dictionaries are slanted by a Christian interpretation. In order for the phrase to be religiously sensitive to all (except of course atheists) it should read: "In a higher power we trust" Posted by: Squatting Bear | May 30, 2007 10:48 AM This is so funny. I'm unsure how anyone who is from the United States of America can question whether or not God when capitalized refers to a Christian God. This country was certainly a haven for extreme or different versions of Christianity from our onset. We have always been majority Christian (argue whether catholics or mormons or mennonites or whomever is Christian later) and therefore the conscious acceptance of God as a reference to the Christian God can only be the correct assumption. Personal politics cannot change facts as they are seen by the majority. The Framers were Christians, and they believed in "God" so think about it for a few minutes and I'm sure you will realize what the coinage is actually implying.

"On the Lot," the new Fox reality series executive-produced by Spielberg and reality show guru Mark Burnett, is proving to be a bust for the network. It debuted May 22 with an audience of 7.6 million, despite the 25-million-viewer lead-in provided by the final performance show of "American Idol." Its second airing on Thursday dropped to 5.2 million, losing nearly half of its lead-in. Steven Spielberg wants to give aspiring filmmakers the chance of a lifetime through "On the Lot," which is far from a blockbuster in the ratings game. (By Gerard Burkhart For The Washington Post) Save & Share Article This week, things got worse for the series in which aspiring filmmakers try to impress celebrity judges with their self-directed mini-movies in hopes of winning a development deal at Spielberg's DreamWorks studio. Monday's and Tuesday's shows averaged just 3.5 million viewers. Despite the low numbers for "On the Lot," Fox claimed victory in last week's Nielsen ratings race thanks to the final two episodes of "American Idol." Although the series lost viewers overall from past seasons, the final performance and result shows averaged 25.3 million and 30.7 million viewers, respectively. Fox also debuted the third season of the dance competition series "So You Think You Can Dance" last Thursday. Its audience of 9.5 million won the 8 p.m. time slot, but was down more than 1 million from last May's premiere. Some notable season finales last week: ABC's "The Bachelor," in which Andy Baldwin chose Washington native Tessa Horst, drew 12.7 million viewers, its most watched telecast since the May 2004 finale; Fox's "24" drew 10.3 million, its second smallest finale in six seasons; NBC's "Heroes" audience of 13.4 million was off about 1 million from the show's season average; and ABC's "Lost" on Wednesday garnered 13.9 million, 4 million below last year's finale. Meanwhile, no one seemed to notice that the Aaron Sorkin drama "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip" was back on the air. Only 3.9 million viewers caught Thursday night's return episode on NBC. But, Tom Selleck still has it. His Tuesday night movie "Jesse Stone: Sea Change" on CBS managed to pull in nearly 14 million viewers despite competition from the "Dancing With the Stars" finale, with an audience of 23 million. The top 10 programs, in order, were: Fox's Wednesday and Tuesday "American Idol"; ABC's Tuesday and Monday "Dancing With the Stars"; CBS's "NCIS"; ABC's "Lost"; CBS's "CSI"; NBC's "Heroes"; CBS's "Jesse Stone: Sea Change"; and ABC's "The Bachelor."

But while international B.O. edged up -- by $6 million, or 2% -- the pic's domestic tally dipped by $2.2 million. All told, global figures eked up 0.8% higher than the Mouse House had estimated, bringing the latest entry in the "Pirates" franchise to $404 million over six days rather than the $401 million the studio reported Monday. Mark Zoradi, prexy of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture marketing and distribution, said the uptick showed "Pirates" has "truly becoming a cultural phenomenon all over the world." "The global box office returns have continued to exceed our expectations and estimates," he added. Pic's perf has been particularly pumped by its overseas grosses, which account for 62% of the worldwide total. With that figure at $404 million, "Pirates" beat out the $382 million that "Spider-Man 3" earned over its first six days in release. But back here at home, "Pirates" numbers didn't completely live up to some of the outsized expectations of B.O. watchers handicapping Memorial Day weekend. Domestically, the movie's actual take was somewhat less than studio estimates: "Pirates" played to $139.8 million over the four days of Memorial weekend, Disney said, rather than $142 million. Pic still handily set the record for the Memorial Day frame, beating Fox's "X-Men: The Last Stand," which cracked $122.8 million last year. Overall domestic cume -- including limited Thursday runs of "Pirates" -- was $153 million, rather than the $156 million Disney estimated Monday. By comparison, "Spider-Man 3" opened to a three-day record of more than $151 million and has captured $307.6 million after a month in theaters. Internationally, "Pirates" set an overseas launch record with $251 million over six days, $19 million ahead of "Spider-Man 3" and up notably from Disney's $245 million estimate. Pic posted record-breaking openings in 17 territories, including Argentina, Ecuador, Holland, Iceland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, Panama, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine and Venezuela. Germany contributed significantly more than had been estimated Monday, with an increase of nearly $3 million to $22.9 million, trailing only the U.K. with $34.5 million. Other top hauls abroad came from France ($22 million), South Korea ($19.3 million), Japan ($18.4 million), Russia ($15.4 million), Spain ($13.2 million) and Australia ($10.5 million). "At World's End" still hasn't opened in two key markets -- India, where it launches Friday, and China, where it opens June 10. Sony took issue Tuesday with Disney's claim of a six-day record, asserting it should be counted as seven days, since BVI opened "At World's End" a day earlier than reported in France and Italy on May 22. BVI said in response that its "Pirates" biz on that day consisted of $1.2 million at 251 playdates from evening showings in France and $200,000 from previews in Italy. Still, Sony asserted "Spider-Man 3" should be given the record for grossing $418.1 million in its first seven days.

So what glamorous indulgence is this member of the industry elite, married to hotshot producer Brian Grazer, interrupting for an interview about the TV adaptation of her book "The Starter Wife" that's airing this week? Turns out Grazer is on her cellphone and in her car, parked down the street from a home where one of her two sons, the seven-year-old, is enjoying a play date. This undated photo, provided by USA Network, shows actress Debra Messing as Molly Kagan in the six-part miniseries "The Starter Wife," debuting on USA at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday, May 24. (AP Photo/USA Network, Paul A Broben) Email to a friend "I'm like skulking around, making sure he's OK. It's ridiculous," she says, with a laugh. "This is the most well-adjusted kid .... Obviously, the mother's not so well-adjusted." A relentless satirist, Grazer doesn't cut anyone - herself included - any slack. And she delights in brushing shoulders with the grasping, self-absorbed types who are part of the entertainment capital and her work. "Hey, I don't mind those people because I get to write about them. Bring on the bad behaviour!" Grazer said. Her printed candour hasn't led to tense confrontations, she said; quite the opposite. "I actually had more people coming up to me, especially after this book, because they saw people that they knew in it." Grazer said. "And I'd think, 'But you're on page 32.' They would give me more information that I didn't ask for, like who their husband was sleeping with." "It just comes down to people want attention, and they'll take positive attention or negative attention," she said, adding with a laugh: "I feel like God put me here." "The Starter Wife," her 2005 bestseller, is the basis of a six-part miniseries debuting 9 p.m. EDT Thursday on USA Network. It runs through June 30. Debra Messing ("Will & Grace") stars as a studio boss' wife who is abruptly edited out for a younger woman and, in turn, is shunned by her social circle. Lose your status, lose your life, Molly Kagan learns - and maybe find yourself. It's a realistic depiction of the industry's social mores, said writers and executive producers Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon. The longtime writing team's movie credits include "Runaway Bride." "We knew two people who were in a Hollywood marriage that broke up and knew she was off the list," McGibbon said. "Only one of them was going to (top agent) Ed Limato's Oscar party and it was the more famous person, even though she herself was a producer." Grazer's novel has a caustically comic edge that was eased for the miniseries, the pair said. Characters and subplots also were added to expand the story. "The book is more cynical, and when we tried to put that in the screenplay it wasn't likable: A billionaire woman becoming a millionaire," McGibbon said. "We had to make her more identifiable to any woman who was dumped because she's no longer what the guy wants and she has to start her life over again." John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

The young hunter is not accused of doing anything illegal, but the head enforcement officer for Alabama's wildlife agency said agents are trying to determine if anyone broke a state law prohibiting the transportation and release of live feral swine. "There are some questions about where the animal came from, how he got there, how long he'd been there," said Allan Andress, enforcement chief for the Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division. Andress said officials also will review whether the hunt complied with the state's "fair chase" law, which requires that prey at hunting plantations have a reasonable chance of escape. Eddy Borden, the owner of the spread where the hunt occurred, declined comment on how the hog got into the 150-acre fenced-in area where it was killed last month by Jamison Stone of Pickensville. Borden said he was getting tired of questions about the hog, which Jamison's father said weighed 1,051 pounds and measured 9 feet, 4 inches from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. The kill drew international attention. "I didn't ask for the publicity. I just want it to all go away," said Borden, whose Lost Creek Plantation is located in east Alabama. Keith O'Neal, one of the guides who accompanied Jamison and father Mike Stone on the paid hunt, said he was unsure if the super swine was placed in the enclosure or grew up it. Jamison was hunting with his father and the guides on May 3 when he killed the giant pig. He said he shot the huge animal eight times with a .50-caliber revolver and chased it for three hours through hilly woods before finishing it off with a point-blank shot. Mike Stone said neither he nor his son did anything wrong. "It's an 11-year-old boy who went hunting," said Mike Stone. "He was enjoying all the attention at first, but it's all getting old." Andress said there is nothing illegal about a child hunting in Alabama.

Famous Music was founded in 1928 to publish music from movies and owns the themes to many films including "The Godfather" and "Beverly Hills Cop." Earlier information had indicated the deal would involve assumed debt, but Sony/ATV spokeswoman Lisa Gerphardt said that would not be the case. Famous Music is being acquired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, a joint venture formed in 1995 between Sony and trusts set up by Michael Jackson. It is not part of Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a business that combines the music operations of Sony and BMG, a unit of the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG. Sony/ATV Music Publishing owns or administers more than 500,000 copyrights by artists including The Beatles, Beck, Joni Mitchell and Roy Orbison. Viacom owns cable networks such as MTV and VH1 and the Paramount movie studio. Famous Music was its only property in the music business. Famous Music's roster of songwriters includes Shakira, Akon, Linda Perry and others. Through its Extreme division, Famous Music also supplies recordings and musical compositions for use in television and radio advertisements, film and television productions, trailers, and major network and cable broadcast promos.

The agreement, announced Wednesday, came after an extensive auction attracted interest from private equity investors and Universal Music Group, The New York Times reported. Sony-ATV is a partnership between Sony and the singer Michael Jackson. Famous Music, Viacom's worldwide music publishing division, is a publishing catalog with rights to roughly 125,000 songs, ranging from "Moon River" to " Hips Don't Lie." Its stable of songwriters include Akron and Shakier. Viacom, which operates cable channels such as MTV and Nickelodeon, put it up for auction after concluding the catalog wasn't a core asset. Famous' catalog also includes film scores, such as themes from "The Godfather" and "Beverly Hills Cop." Viacom took over the business as part of its acquisition of the Paramount movie studio. Sony has been in the market for publishing catalogs, which generate income when their songs are used in television shows or films, played on the radio or recorded.

Showbiz | Thursday, 31 May 2007 SKIN THIN: Nicole Richie told friends that no one who weighed over 45kg would be allowed into her Memorial Day party in an email her publicist called 'a joke'. What the Kiwi gossip mags say Richie refuses to visit sick mum Nicole Richie told friends no girls who weighed more than 45kg would be admitted to her Memorial Day party. The Simple Life star emailed pals inviting them to a party on Sunday, May 28, urging them to starve themselves because there would be weighing scales outside. But a representative for Richie says the email was "a joke". Nicole - who has been plagued by eating disorder rumours - wrote: "My fellow Americans it's that time of year - to celebrate our country by drinking massive amounts of beer. "Let's stand together as one, live the American dream. Take shots, pass out, and wake up with our pants ripped open at the seams. "Let's glorify this day in your sluttiest tops and your tightest pair of Tsubi jeans. Even though we have no f***ing clue what Memorial Day really means!! "There will be a scale at the front door. No girls over 100lbs (45kg) allowed in. Start starving yourself now. See you all then!!!" One guest, Mischa Barton collapsed at the party and was hospitalised after mixing alcohol with antibiotics. The bash was held at "Masha's" house - a pseudonym for Nicole's friend Paris Hilton. However, Nicole's representative has insisted she was joking in the email and didn't want anyone to not eat. The rep' said: "This invitation was sent via email to her friends who understand that she was responding in a joking manner to the constant untruths printed about her in the media. "Her reference to Memorial Day was in no way meant to offend anyone but was simply an expression of her distaste for the current situation." On her way home from the party, Nicole was involved in a minor car accident while driving rocker boyfriend Joel Madden's BMW. The 25-year-old - who is currently awaiting a court hearing on a charge of DUI (driving under the influence) - stopped at a gas station on the corner of La Cienega Boulevard and Holloway Drive in Los Angeles, where she backed into another customer's Honda convertible. Witnesses said Nicole was mortified and went to "hug it out" with the other car owner.

Jamison Stone and his prized pig. An 11-year-old Alabama boy caught in the center of a humongous hog controversy denied his monster kill was staged Wednesday in an interview with FOXNews.com. "I just want to say it&#8217;s not fake," said Stone made news last week when the world learned of his massive kill, a 1,051-pound feral hog, which he shot eight times with a pistol on a hunting preserve in eastern Alabama. But the young man soon found himself in a media maelstrom when some Web sites questioned the veracity of the photographs. "He did kill that pig," the boy's father, Mike Stone, told FOXNews.com. "Those pictures are not doctored." Jamison, who recently completed the sixth grade at Christian Heritage Academy in Carrollton, Ala., shot the pig on a hunt May 3 at the in Delta, Ala., with a .50-caliber revolver. His story made national news and the family traveled to New York to talk about their adventure, but blogs soon claimed to be able to prove the photos were faked. Photo of Monster Hog Called Into Question; Web Site Claims It Was Doctored Alabama Boy Kills 1,051-Pound Monster Pig, Bigger Than 'Hogzilla' "No pictures have been touched," the 11-year-old said. "They first were saying I couldn&#8217;t shoot the gun, but I could and I did." What should have been a moment of fun in the spotlight for a middle schooler became a nightmare, with some bloggers asking Mike Stone to take measurements of his son's skull to prove his claims, he said. "Before we got to New York this was a feel good story, everybody was excited about it," Mike Stone said. "And now all of a sudden my family is suffering because people are making fun of it and thinking that it's not real." After Jamison bagged his pig May 3, the Stones took their prize to the Clay County Farmers Exchange in Lineville, Ala., where it weighed in at 1,051 and measured approximately 9 feet 4 inches. In the heat of the moment, Mike Stone said, they snapped a few photographs for family and friends to share Jamison's moment of pride. "We would have took pictures of the scales, we would have took pictures of us measuring it, we would have took pictures of all the stuff if we would have thought this was going to be some big deal," Mike Stone said. Jerry Cunningham, owner of Jerry's Taxidermy in Oxford, Ala., said the feral hog was one of the largest he'd seen. "They&#8217;re about as twice as big as the normal pig," Cunningham told FOXNews.com. "Five-hundred pounds is big, giant. Most of them that come in to be mounted are between 150 and 250." On Tuesday night, Cunningham showed Jamison the hog's mounted skull. Mike Stone, who stresses to his family the importance of hunting for food, had the rest of the humongous hog made into breakfast sausage. &#8220;We gave a lot of it away ... some of them are going to use it at church fundraising breakfasts, some of them are going to use it for school fundraising breakfasts," Mike Stone said. "We actually do have two big freezers completely full." The boy's pig adventure is documented on , where the response from the public has been about 85 percent positive, Mike Stone said. "Regardless of what the negative e-mails say, we're not ashamed of the fact that we actually hunt," Mike Stone said.

Posted May 30th 2007 1:37PM by TMZ has received an exclusive statement from one of the owners of , the Hollywood nightclub where Lindsay Lohan hanging out just hours before her DUI bust.: "Les Deux is a restaurant, open five nights a week, and there is no age limit for our patrons. Lindsay had dinner at Les Deux that night and waited for friends to pack up the DJ supplies, thus leaving Les Deux after closing. Because of the enormous paparazzi presence outside of Les Deux that night, we allowed her to stay late and wait for her friends. She was not drinking at Les Deux, and left driven by her driver." Les Deux has also issued a response to TMZ's story that the ABC (Alcohol Beverage Control) is investigating into Lohan's DUI: "We have and will continue to work closely with the ABC to make sure alcohol is consumed by responsible people of the legal drinking age, in a responsible manner."

Tell a friend by email Tell a friend by AOL Instant Messenger This Ain't No Jive This Ain't No Jive Is Justin Timberlake going out on a limb forming a new label at Interscope, instead of his recording home Jive, or is Interscope taking the real risk by creating a costly new venture in the face of declining record sales? Says JC Chasez: ''&#91;Timberlake's&#93; going to bring a lot of heat, because the world is staring at him right now.'' Justin Timberlake considered partnering with any number of major labels while shopping for a home for his Tennman Records imprint. So why did he ultimately go with Interscope Records and not, for instance, Jive, where Timberlake has been signed as an artist since his teen years in 'Nsync? ''The thing that ultimately made the decision for him,'' Timberlake's longtime manager Johnny Wright explains to EW.com, ''was the labels that &#91;Interscope&#93; already had and the people who were running them. Timbaland has a label there, Pharrell has a label there, will.i.am has a label there. If &#91;Justin has&#93; a synergy with these producers and writers, why not be there?'' (A representative for Jive confirmed that Timberlake is still on their roster but declined further comment.) Still, with profits from CD sales continuing to plummet industry-wide, there are clear risks for any label that decides to launch a costly new project like Tennman. Wright declined to discuss the deal's financial terms, but as one top industry insider comments: ''To be in business with Justin Timberlake, one of the biggest stars in the world, isn't cheap. It puts too much pressure on the deal.'' Tennman president Ken Komisar &#151; former VP of A&R for Sony BMG &#151; concedes that any start-up imprint faces steep challenges, but he believes Timberlake's successful track record as an artist and, more recently, as a writer and producer for other acts, can bring success to the new label. ''Someone who has the creative vision that he has &#151; it doesn't take all the risk away, but it certainly helps to make the odds a little better.'' Former *NSync bandmate JC Chasez, who enlisted Timberlake's production and songwriting skills for several tracks on his forthcoming sophomore album, , points out that Timberlake's status as an international megastar doesn't hurt either. ''Obviously, he's going to bring a lot of heat, because the world is staring at him right now,'' Chasez says. ''He brings free press with him wherever he goes.'' But does the 26 year-old have the business acumen to run a label? Nate ''Danjahandz'' Hills, Timbaland protégé and co-producer of number-one Timberlake singles ''SexyBack'' and ''My Love,'' says he witnessed the star's marketing savvy first-hand. '' 'SexyBack', he knew it was risky for him,'' Hills says. ''He knew he didn't sound like himself and he'd been gone for a while.'' Nevertheless, Timberlake fought to have the song released as 's first single. As Jive CEO Barry Weiss told EW back in February, ''It was an unusual record, but it was a risk that clearly paid off.'' It remains to be seen whether Timberlake will sign artists that will approach his level of success, and it might be a while before we find out. ''We're in a short-term business right now,'' says the insider. ''He wasn't walking in with an exciting, brand-new artist. It could be another two years before a record comes out &#91;on Tennman&#93;.'' A senior executive at another label is cautiously optimistic about any new venture headed by a recording artist: ''Justin himself is a tremendous musical force, so there's no better person to get in business with. But it's tougher than ever now to break an act. The key ends up being, can he pick and identify great talent? We've all known superstar artists who've gotten labels and not been able to pick talent and others who could.'' Timberlake has yet to announce any signees to Tennman (the name's a nod to his Tennessee roots). Says Wright, ''He just doesn't want artists that are sitting around waiting for Justin to come in and write a song or Justin to tell them what direction to go in. He wants artists that he's proud to do a duet with &#91;or&#93; put on his stage.'' Recent Internet speculation suggests his first artist could be Dutch teen and online sensation magazine reported that Denters' popular YouTube performances had attracted frantic attention from a host of major labels. In her most , Denters covers Timberlake's ''What Goes Around... Comes Around'' &#151; complete with a surprise cameo from Timberlake himself. Though no one in Timberlake's camp would confirm or deny any plans to sign Denters, Wright confirms that the star has talked with the teen and is ''definitely interested'' in working with her. Hills recalls, ''&#91;Justin&#93; was like, `She's crazy! I definitely want to get in the studio.' '' He was just excited about getting in with her and doing some music.'' Adds Komisar: ''&#91;Denters&#93; is hugely talented. We've all seen &#91;her talent&#93; unveil itself on YouTube, and you see the strength and power she has on her own. We'd be very lucky to work with her.'' If Timberlake can bring his Midas touch to Tennman, it's Denters who'd be the lucky one.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/30/entertainment/e111253D54.DTL&cid Judd Apatow: Comedian Behind the Camera Judd Apatow: Comedian Behind the Camera By JAKE COYLE, AP Entertainment Writer Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (05-30) 18:44 PDT New York (AP) -- At a recent Q&A following an advance screening of the riotous comedy "Superbad," a woman in the audience asked the film's producer Judd Apatow if he makes "romantic comedies for men." "That sounds like product &#8212; or a lube," replied the 39-year-old filmmaker. Apatow, the director of "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" and the new "Knocked Up," acknowledged such a label wasn't far off the mark, but said he doesn't think much about categorizing what he does. Besides, he said, "Isn't there love in every movie?" A classification like "romantic comedies for men" also doesn't do justice to other staples of Apatow's work &#8212; namely, an endless barrage of filthy jokes, cleverly delivered. And yet Apatow's comedy always maintains &#8212; as Seth Rogen, the star of "Knocked Up" and a frequent collaborator of Apatow's, says &#8212; an "oddly sweet" quality. Thanks to the huge success of 2005's "The 40 Year-Old Virgin," Apatow has broken through to the mainstream after a career that has spanned contributions to some of the most critically acclaimed comedies of the past 15 years &#8212; from "The Ben Stiller Show" to "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy." With the Friday release of the eagerly awaited "Knocked Up," it's clear he's become a behind-the-scenes ringleader to a thriving era of comedy that revels in mixing the dumb with the smart, the bawdy with the sincere. "I'm trying to figure out how to get gigantic laughs without losing my reality level," the wry, bearded Apatow explained over lunch at a recent interview in New York. "That's always the dance." Even as a teenager, Apatow was at the center of comedy. For his high-school radio show on Long Island in the mid-`80s, he managed to interview Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern, the original writers of "Saturday Night Live" and many others. "I really met EVERYBODY over the course of two years," Apatow recalls. "I would just ask them how they did it. It was an excuse to spend an hour asking: How do you write a joke?" Apatow later moved West to study screenwriting at USC, where he dropped out within two years thanks, in part, to a free trip won on "The Dating Game" &#8212; a comic twist in Apatow's biography worthy of one of his films. As a struggling standup, he lived with Adam Sandler and began writing jokes for other comedians, eventually writing for Roseanne Barr. His first and only attempt to work in front of the camera was quickly scuttled after a trip to an acting coach. "It was the worst acting anyone has ever done," says Apatow. "At that moment, the dream of comedian becoming actor died. I folded my cards immediately." Rejections by "Saturday Night Live" and "In Living Color" followed, but then he met Ben Stiller. Apatow executive-produced "The Ben Stiller Show" (1992), the short-lived but acclaimed Fox sketch show that spawned the careers of a myriad of comedians, including Stiller, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk and Andy Dick. "In a lot of ways, that's where everything started," says Apatow. "People connect the dots and see all the people I've worked with, but really, it all comes from Stiller." He then wrote for five years on HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show," eventually becoming an executive producer. The show's star, Garry Shandling remains a mentor. Like the dialogue of "Knocked Up," Apatow's speech is riddled with pop-culture references. He grew up obsessed with the Marx Brothers and Steve Martin, watched Woody Allen films endlessly, considers Harold Ramis' movies ("Caddyshack,""Groundhog Day") "a gigantic influence" and found inspiration in the mix of humor and realism in films like "Terms of Endearment" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." To Apatow, his greatest achievement is "Freaks and Geeks," the beloved cult favorite hour-long TV series that ran for only one season in 1999-2000. The show, created by Paul Feig and executive produced by Apatow, was followed by another acclaimed but canceled series: "Undeclared." "In a way, the movies are an extension of those TV shows," says Apatow. "Some people have been saying, `Do you feel like the reason these movies ("Virgin,""Knocked Up") are doing OK is because your work is getting better?' And I'm always like, `No, I don't think I'll ever make anything as good as "Freaks and Geeks."'" The lack of commercial success on the small screen led Apatow to concentrate on producing film projects, including a number of Will Ferrell films: "Anchorman,""Kicking and Screaming" and "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky and Bobby." "He obviously has this unique talent of someone who can make what would probably be classified as a broad comedy, but yet he's finding ways to deal with these real issues that we all face," says Ferrell. "He's tackling them in ways we haven't seen before." The box-office success of "Anchorman" helped Apatow get backing for "Virgin," his directorial debut, which he co-wrote with Steve Carell. "It gave me a career path," he says. "The beginning of my career was mainly about helping my friends execute their ideas, which was really fun but it wasn't based on my personal point of view." "Knocked Up," also written by Apatow, is very personal for him. Though the film &#8212; in which Rogen plays an immature pothead who has parenthood thrust upon him after a one-night stand with a far more professional woman (Katherine Heigl) &#8212; isn't directly autobiographical, the issues of facing adulthood are familiar to the director. Further, much of Apatow's life can be seen on screen. His wife, actress Leslie Mann, co-stars; their two young daughters play her character's children; Ramis symbolically plays a wise father to Rogen; and a good number of the actors from his past TV shows and movies have notable parts or make cameos. Mann, whom Apatow met while working on the Jim Carrey movie "The Cable Guy," says that while everything in "Knocked Up" has been reflected against a "funhouse mirror," much of it is culled from their relationship. For example, the scene where Allison (Heigl) boots Ben (Rogen) from the car while driving to the gynecologist was taken directly from an argument of theirs. Frequently working with his close-knit troupe of friends and actors, Apatow's style is heavy on improvisation and collaboration. The famous "You know why I know you're gay?" running bit in "Virgin" was improvised, and "Knocked Up" provides a similar gag based on a setup of "You look like..." to describe an extremely hairy character (Martin Starr). A recently released two-disc DVD edition of "Virgin" includes footage of Apatow relentlessly shouting new lines to his actors as they riff their way through a scene &#8212; a method he calls "rewriting while the cameras are rolling." Apatow also holds numerous screenings of early cuts of his films for filmmaker friends in hopes of garnering feedback. "What really sets him apart is just how collaborative he is, and how confident in yourself you have to be in order to be collaborative and take ideas from your actors and your friends," says Rogen, who was a teenager when Apatow cast him in "Freaks and Geeks." "Knocked Up," which was completed in February, arrives in theaters on a sizable wave of buzz, aided by very early screenings to critics and press. As a relatively low-budget film starring the little-known Rogen, it's a film that needs substantial word-of-mouth to compete with summer blockbusters. The low-cost, laugh-heavy approach has proven appealing to studios; "Virgin" grossed $109 million at the box office on a production budget of $26 million. "Knocked Up," rated-R like "Virgin," is also in the same budget range and was well received by Universal Pictures, Apatow says. "They may have just been happy that I didn't ask for triple the budget and robots," he deadpans. Another key to his success is that he's largely been able to keep creative control of his films. Mann says he passed on numerous films before making "Virgin." Now, after years of unsold scripts pilling up, Apatow's projects are getting the green light. Besides "Superbad," this year will also see the release of another Apatow production, "The Pineapple Express," which was written by Rogen. Next year will be "Walk Hard," a mock biopic in the style of "Ray" starring John C. Reilly and "You Don't Mess with the Zohan," which Apatow co-wrote with Sandler. "It's almost more than a Jew from Long Island can handle," Apatow says of his good fortune. "All my assumptions about myself are confused when people like the work. On some level, it's almost more comfortable for it to go the other way." Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Click to view a larger picture On the Tube / By Alan Pergament Pergament: First-class casts elevate two female-centric series Updated: 05/31/07 8:10 AM It&#8217;s the time of year that the networks trot out laughable, uplifting reality series like ABC&#8217;s &#8220;The Ex-Wives Club&#8221; that belong on cable while cable trots out scripted shows like &#8220;The Starter Wife&#8221; and &#8220;Army Wives&#8221; that belong on network television. &#8220;The Starter Wife&#8221; premieres at 9 tonight with a two-hour movie on USA Network, one of the cable channels owned by NBC&#8217;s parent company. The six-hour series has subsequent hour episodes on four straight Thursdays. It stars and is narrated by Debra Messing (&#8220;Will & Grace&#8221;). She plays a desperate, thin housewife, Molly Kagan, whose life is shaken after her powerful Hollywood husband, Kenny Kagan (Peter Jacobson) &#8212; a small man in more ways than one &#8212; coldly tells her via a phone message that he wants a divorce. Needless to say, it&#8217;s a comedy about pain and superficiality that is based on a best-seller by Gigi Levangie Grazer, the wife of Hollywood producer Brian Grazer. Molly not only loses her husband, but also her entree into the Hollywood scene. She also loses friends who are more worried about their husbands&#8217; career mobility than helping an old friend deal with a lifechanging crisis that makes Molly question whether she should have enjoyed life by eating more for the past 12 years. &#8220;I am so stopping for a burger and fries on the way home,&#8221; she says after learning she is on the road to divorce. The cast includes Judy Davis as one of Molly&#8217;s true friends, Joan, an alcoholic who lets Molly live in a beach house while she is off in detox playing a therapist for a fool. Chris Diamantopoulos is Molly&#8217;s gay friend, Rodney, who also stands by her. Joe Mantegna is a thrice-divorced Hollywood executive, Lou Manahan, who is tired of making movies for 14- year-olds and of dealing with all the fake characters he&#8217;s met over the years. Supportive of Molly, he tells her: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure how your story ends.&#8221; Molly also has some new struggling friends. Anika Noni Rose stars as Lavender, a goodhearted security guard with financial problems who takes care of her mother. Stephen Moyer is Sam, a hunk with a mysterious past who lights Molly&#8217;s fire even after she discovers a secret about him that makes him considerably less than a big catch. But at least he&#8217;s true to himself while living an unglamorous life, which makes him practically unique in Hollywood. In the first four episodes made available for review, the name-dropping script by Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon takes advantage of Messing&#8217;s appeal and ability to do zany. Davis could do her dryly comic role in her sleep and Mantegna is his usual solid self. Directed by Jon Avnet, the series also has several increasingly annoying fantasy scenes in which Molly imagines herself in old movies like &#8220;The Wizard of Oz.&#8221; Hollywood cliches abound and the material becomes so repetitive that I&#8217;m not even sure I care to find out how Molly&#8217;s story ends in the final two episodes. Check that. If it means avoiding one of NBC&#8217;s endless reality shows this summer, then I&#8217;m all for finishing &#8220;The Starter Wife.&#8221; The new Lifetime series &#8220;Army Wives,&#8221; which premieres at 10 p.m. Sunday, also has a network pedigree. It is produced by the ABC Television Studio. Lifetime also is partially owned by ABC. Mark Gordon of &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; serves as one of the executive producers. &#8220;Wives&#8221; has some similarities to &#8220;Grey&#8217;s&#8221; in that it focuses on the love lives of mostly traditional married couples, often set to melancholy music. The couples live on an Army post while the Iraq War is going on, giving it some of the same resonance of &#8220;Over There,&#8221; the Steven Bochco series that aired on FX. The casting also is of network quality. Kim Delaney (&#8220;NYPD Blue&#8221;) stars as Claudia Joy Holden, the loving wife of a Col. Michael Holden (Brian Mc- Namara). Catherine Bell (&#8220;JAG&#8221;) also is aboard as Denise Sherwood, the devoted wife of a major (Frank Serpico) who keeps a secret from him. Brigid Brannagh plays Pamela Moran, a wife who tries to keep a family secret from everyone. However, the most compelling character &#8212; Roxy LeBlanc, a sexy, naive and street-smart Southern mother of two who is married to an enthusiastic paratrooper &#8212; is played by a lesser known actress, Sally Pressman. This being Lifetime, it isn&#8217;t surprising that the female characters make a stronger impression than the male ones. The men include Sterling K. Brown as Roland Burton, a psychiatrist unsure how to deal with his wife, Lt. Col. Joan Burton (Wendy Davis), when she struggles after returning from a tour in Afghanistan. Drew Fuller also stars as Roxy&#8217;s romantic and principled husband, Trevor. The first three episodes of the series, based on a book by Tanya Biank, introduce the characters and the difficulties they face &#8212; post-traumatic stress, domestic abuse, financial stress and the anxiety of having loved ones whose lives are in danger daily. There also are political games being played by some wives and some dissent from the teenage children who are being raised in a judgmental world where it is &#8220;my way or the highway.&#8221; Thankfully, there also is some humor, because at times the plots are a little heavy-handed. The second episode also drags a little too much. But Pressman&#8217;s star turn as the lovable outsider brought into a world that she can influence practically makes the series first class summer entertainment. &#8220; The Starter Wife&#8221; *** ( Out of four) 9 p. m. tonight on USA Network *** (Out of four) 10 p. m.

An MGM release of an Element Films and Relativity Media presentation, in association with Eden Rock Media, of a TIG production. Produced by Jim Wilson, Kevin Costner, Raynold Gideon. Executive producers, Sam Nazarian, Adam Rosenfelt, Marc Shaberg, Thomas Augsberger. Co-executive producer, Malcolm Petal. Directed by Bruce A. Evans. Screenplay, Evans, Raynold Gideon. Mr. Brooks - Kevin Costner Tracy Atwood - Demi Moore Mr. Smith - Dane Cook Marshall - William Hurt Emma Brooks - Marg Helgenberger Hawkins - Ruben Santiago-Hudson Jane Brooks - Danielle Panabaker In this ogre-ridden, ocean-going summer of sequels, "Mr. Brooks" reps a classic case of counter-programming. Original, adult and starring Kevin Costner as a serial killer, this suspense thriller with a smirk may not break any B.O. records, but it should provide discriminating audiences the antidote they seek to Clooneys-and-Caribbean fever, while giving Costner's career a considerable kick in the credibility department. Costner's mere presence in this noirish Bruce A. Evans-helmed psycho-drama -- which Costner also produced, with longtime partner Jim Wilson and co-writer Raynold Gideon -- is an attention grabber. Although one of the actor's best performances was as murderer Butch Haynes in Clint Eastwood's "A Perfect World," "Mr. Brooks" takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward murder and portrays its serial killer as an addicted personality, who tries 12-stepping his way to a less-murderous lifestyle. It would have been an entirely different movie with a more conventional star -- Anthony Hopkins springs to mind (as does "Silence of the Lambs''). But Costner delivers a complex cocktail of aloofness, insecurity and reluctant threat, which makes a novel script into something even more unusual. Add Demi Moore as the detective on the killer's trail -- another case of mid-career adjustment -- and "Mr. Brooks" becomes as much about perception as it is a peculiar take on reality. By all appearances, Earl Brooks is a pillar of his community. He even receives Man of the Year honors from an unnamed group in his unnamed city, as his wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger) looks on adoringly. What none of the town folk--including Emma--know is that Earl has been murdering people for years -- expertly, strategically, cold-bloodedly. Although he's been keeping his homicidal demons at bay by attending AA meetings, his conscience -- which has a name, Marshall, and is played by William Hurt -- is prodding him to break his tenuous self-imposed sobriety and spill fresh blood. Enter the subplots: Tracy Atwood (Moore) is a predictably hard-as-nails detective who lost the so-called "Thumbprint Killer's" trail two years earlier and has other things on her mind -- for one, a gold digging, soon-to-be-ex-husband (Jason Lewis). Earl, too, has tangential concerns: A daughter (Danielle Panabaker), who may or may not have inherited his serial-killer gene (the science of "Mr. Brooks" may leave some viewers bewildered). And once he falls off the wagon, killing a pair of dancers in their uncurtained bedroom, Mr. Brooks acquires a kind of apprentice, Mr. Smith (Dane Cook), who saw what Earl did and wants to go along for the thrill ride. There are also a pair of crystal-meth freaks out to avenge themselves on Tracy, which provides the film its few shoot-'em-up moments and a car crash or two. But "Mr. Brooks" is most effective when it's dealing with Earl and his conscience. Hurt and Costner are terrific together as two sides of the same personality and, again, the casting is what it's all about. Marshall could have been portrayed as a grotesque monster, but instead, he's a very close complement to Earl -- similar in age, temperament and physique. John Lindley's subtle cinematography superbly delivers a morally dark film. Production values in general are topnotch.

Marvel Comics superhero the Silver Surfer, as featured in the forthcoming sequel "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer," found planets for his boss Galactus to consume until he turned to the good side. To promote the movie, 20th Century Fox got the Franklin Mint to "consume" 40,000 U.S. quarters and add a promotional image of the Surfer on the back. (If you found a quarter, you would be a trip to the world premiere of "Silver Surfer" in London). Cool? Debatable. Legal tender? Not so much. Actually, we were relieved that the U.S. Mint said Fox because it confirmed what we learned on our tour of the U.S. Mint. You can't take the tour in Washington D.C. like we did lo these many years ago (read: before 9/11), but the mints are open to visitors year-round. (If you're in D.C. already, you could see the , but they don't actually make the money there.) Maybe the execs at Fox, who claim they had no idea altering currency is something only the government can do, ought to treat themselves to a tour. & Login To Post A Comment Silver Surfer Angers U.S. Mint Not yet a member?

Jamison Stone, 11, claimed he shot and killed a massive wild pig that weighed more than 1,000 pounds earlier this month. He said the animal measured more than 9 feet from tail to snout. Jamison said he bagged the boar on a hunting preserve in eastern Alabama. However, the animal's size had some wondering if the whole thing was tall tale, despite pictures provided by his father. Now he has the swine's skull and some backup from a taxidermist. "Jerry (Cunningham), the taxidermist, brought me this bleached skull of my hog and this is a 1,051-pound hog skull and that's a ... 250-pound hog skull," the boy said, pointing to the skull of a smaller animal, placed next to his monster's hog for comparison. Cunningham agreed with Jamison on the size of the boar. "I actually skinned this pig out," Cunningham said. "And I know it was a 1,000-pound hog. It was that big. No doubt."

Maroon 5 debuts at No. 1 on album chart LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Are the movies running out of heroes and is this why lovable Kevin Costner, the perfect guy to play a washed-up baseball player, is now playing a sympathetic serial killer? Costner in an interview emphatically denies that is the reason he took the role of businessman Earl Brooks, the hero or villain depending on your point of view of "Mr Brooks," a reworking of both the Hannibal Lecter and Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde sagas which opens on Friday. Prissy Mr. Brooks is such a nice guy in his day job that he is named Portland, Oregon's "Man of the Year."

Thursday, 31st May 2007 Wed 30 May 2007 Kevin Costner attends the premiere of "Mr. Brooks" at the Grauman's Chinese theater in Hollywood, California May 22, 2007. He took the role of businessman Earl Brooks, the hero or villain depending on your point of view of "Mr Brooks," a reworking of both the Hannibal Lecter and Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde sagas which opens on Friday. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni Would you believe Costner as killer? LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Are the movies running out of heroes and is this why lovable Kevin Costner, the perfect guy to play a washed-up baseball player, is now playing a sympathetic serial killer? Costner in an interview emphatically denies that is the reason he took the role of businessman Earl Brooks, the hero or villain depending on your point of view of "Mr Brooks," a reworking of both the Hannibal Lecter and Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde sagas which opens on Friday. Prissy Mr. Brooks is such a nice guy in his day job that he is named Portland, Oregon's "Man of the Year." And he is so personally embarrassed by his penchant for killing others that he goes to 12-step meetings and keeps imploring the higher power to make him a good person. "Hi," he says, "I am an addict." But he doesn't say what he is addicted to. The executive producer Sam Nazarian of the film released by MGM film is so impressed with Costner's performance that he asked recently, "How many actors can give you a serial killer you can root for?" And for some people that is the trouble with the film -- should you root for a serial killer or not? There are also some critics who say Costner grabbed the role of "Mr Brooks" as a change of pace, that he was tired of playing "Mr. Nice Guys," a notion he dismisses after a long and distinguished career that includes the controversial film "JFK." He also played a washed-up baseball player in 1998's "Bull Durham." "I've played killers before," he told Reuters in an interview in which he stressed that as nice as Mr Brooks might seem to be on the surface, he really isn't nice at all. "He is evil. There is no doubt about that," said Costner, who won Oscars for producing and directing 1990's "Dancing with Wolves." But he added, "I think the film breaks new ground. This is a genre that is not comfortable with a lot of humanity or a real sense of humour. I think the film has a chance to become a classic." He also expects the modestly budgeted film to build an audience by word of mouth rather than hit instant success. The film has a first-class cast with William Hurt as the demon egging Mr Brooks to keep on killing and Demi Moore as the police woman who is in pursuit of him. Bruce A. Evans, who directed and co-wrote the film, said he sees it as almost a Shakespearean tragedy. "This is about a very good man who has a disease .... The audience is asked to understand him." "We wanted to do the total opposite of Hannibal Lecter. We wanted the neighbours to say Mr Brooks was a wonderful man." The studios told Evans he got the idea of serial killers wrong, that they are loners and sociopaths and don't fit into society. "We took the opposite point of view .... If we make money on this film, we will do a sequel," Evans said. The reviews have been mixed with New York Magazine calling it a "holy mess" and Victoria Alexander of FilmsInReview.com saying it was "Costner's best performance ever! An intelligent, terrific thriller with twists and kinky characters." (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Chairman and controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone lauded his management team's track record to-date and the 29% stock increase it has overseen in less than a year. The stock went as high as $44.59 before closing up 1.5% at $44.53. The stock's previous year-high stood at $44.16. Shareholders at the meeting defeated a proposal by three investors that Viacom sell the Paramount studio, with the plan only attracting 0.4% approval. The event started just after Viacom announced an agreement to sell Famous Music -- for an estimated and better-than-expected $370 million -- to Sony/ATV, which is co-owned by Sony and trusts formed by singer Michael Jackson. Top Viacom brass had a strong presence at the meeting, with Dauman welcoming Paramount Motion Picture Group chairman and CEO Brad Grey, MTV Networks chairman and CEO Judy McGrath, BET Networks chairman and CEO Debra Lee and Tom Dooley, Viacom's senior executive vp and CFO. Dauman lauded these executives' combined Viacom experience of nearly a century, earning laughs when starting to add: "And if you throw in Sumner ... ." Redstone on Wednesday lauded Dauman and his team for their strategic vision, financial discipline and creative excellence, saying it was "one of the wisest decisions I've ever made" to make Dauman CEO. Overall, the chairman said he is "really confident" about the company's long-term outlook. More specifically, Redstone added that the firm is "truly hitting its stride in the digital world." Viacom's continued push into the digital space indeed was one key theme of the investor gathering. Asked by a young shareholder about possible original content creations in the digital world, CEO Dauman reiterated that Viacom is planning to roll out some new virtual worlds that are music related and not based on existing Viacom brands. As far as Paramount goes, Dauman lauded its "tremendous progress," adding: "we are enthusiastic about its short-term and long-term (outlook)." The shareholders proposing the Paramount sale had argued past weakness at the studio had held back Viacom's stock and also criticized its films' depiction of smokers. Dauman, however, touted his firm's upcoming films, including "Transformers," "Stardust" and "Beowulf," adding that the 2008 slate is "shaping up quite nicely" as well. The Viacom CEO also said there is a good opportunity in a direct-to-DVD business for Paramount and in creating more film labels based on Viacom cable networks, with BET Pictures launching this year. Dauman did not comment on one shareholder's proposal that Viacom launch a Paramount Movie Channel based on the example of the Fox Movie Channel. Officials weren't available to comment on whether such a channel has been considered. Ahead of Dauman and Redstone's bullish comments Wednesday, Miller Tabak + Co. analyst David Joyce also lauded the recent stock price appreciation at Viacom, raising his price target on the shares by $6 to $51 "to reflect a mix of cable network and studio entertainment businesses that are demonstrating the turnaround investors have started hoping for, reflected in the stock's price improvement, over the past six-plus months." The Famous Music deal, meanwhile, comes after a sales process started a few months ago. "The Famous Music catalog is a world-class asset filled with evergreen songs that people know and love," said Martin Bandier, who recently left his post as head of music publishing at EMI Group Plc. to become chairman and CEO of Sony/ATV. "The addition of the Famous catalog and its songwriters to Sony/ATV is another step in our long-range growth plans." Together with last month's acquisition of the Leiber Stoller music catalog, which includes hits like "Love Potion #9," the Famous deal "further enhances Sony/ATV's position in the global music publishing industry," added Sony Corporation of America CFO Rob Wiesenthal. Jackson, who owns 50% of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, called the transaction "a milestone event," saying "the diverse collection of songs in this (Famous) catalog range from timeless classics to contemporary hits." Founded in 1928, the Famous Music catalog includes 125,000 songs and sound cues, including such classics as "Footloose" and "Moon River," as well as popular themes from such films as "The Godfather," "Forrest Gump," "Mission: Impossible" and "Braveheart," as well as the "Axel F" theme from "Beverly Hills Cop." In addition, the catalog includes such contemporary hits as "Bad Day" by Daniel Powter, Shakira's "Hips Don't Lie" Eminem's "The Real Slim Shady." As for the stock-buyback program, Viacom said it has used up about $2.7 billion of an existing $3 billion repurchase plan, which will be completed. After that, it will buy back up to $4 billion of Viacom Class A and Class B common stock. "We view this as a modest positive for Viacom as we believe that share repurchase is the best capital allocation strategy for Viacom currently," Bear Stearns analyst Spencer Wang said. Also at the shareholder meeting, investors raised concerns about Redstone's high salary, which he defended as "probably too low," and derogative rap lyrics, with Viacom executives saying BET is committed to not allowing offensive lyrics on its air. Rap lyric protesters were joined outside the midtown Manhattan meeting by WGA representatives, who passed out leaflets as part of the guild's current campaign to organize six major shows on Comedy Central, including "Mind of Mencia," "The Sarah Silverman Program," "Reno 911!" and "The Showbiz Show With David Spade."

The dress went under the hammer at a sale of film and entertainment memorabilia at Christie's in New York. The auction house said it had expected the dress to fetch $30,000 (£15,192). In December, a black Givenchy dress created for Hepburn as Holly Golightly in the 1961 film caused an auction frenzy, selling for £467,200. The pink cocktail dress is believed to have been a late addition to the film and was used in the scene where Golightly learns of her brother's death and smashes crockery in a fit of grief. Hepburn was nominated for a best actress Oscar for the role, but lost out to Sophia Loren in Two Women (La Ciociara). Also in the auction was a programme from John F Kennedy's Birthday Celebration in Madison Square Garden, New York, on May 19, 1962 - famous for Marilyn Monroe's birthday serenade - which sold for $66,000 (£33,420). Items from the estate of comedian Stan Laurel made over $100,000 (£50,600). These included his trademark bowler hats, a set of bow ties and a folder with joke ideas: "Rather be pregnant than have tooth pulled? Make up your mind lady, so I'll know which way to tilt the chair," he wrote.

Medical Examiner Testimony Aids In Phil Spector Murder Trial This post was written by Laura Smith on 31 May, 2007 (06:07) | On a night in February 2003, 67-year-old music producer Phil Spector was accompanied by 40-year-old B-movie actress Lana Clarkson back to his home in Alhambra, California. She had been working as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. That night, she was killed by a bullet wound to the mouth. Spector is now on trial for her murder, but he claims that she committed suicide. Medical examiner Dr. Louis Pena recently testified that he believes that Clarkson was murdered that night and has evidence to prove it. He believes the barrel of the gun that was shot into the actressâs mouth was forced into her as indicated by bruising on her tongue and on Clarksonâs hands as well, indicating that blunt force trauma was present. When the trigger was pulled, she was killed instantly as the bullet blew out her top front teeth and severed her spine. The victimâs family was not present in the room when these graphic images were shown to the jury, and at least one jury member looked away. This medical testimony helps aid in some evidence that was unexplainable in the suicide argument that the defense has maintained throughout the trial. Along with this evidence, there are some details about the gruesome scene that donât match up with a suicide execution. For one, Clarkson was found dead in the foyer of Spectorâs mansion with a purse around her shoulder as if she were about to leave. She was said to have no signs of depression as stated by her personal writings. She had not put any of her affairs in order prior to her death to show that any suicide attempt was planned. Clarkson had been taking two drugs that are said to be given to sufferers of depression, but her neurologist has stated that he prescribed them to her for her complaints of chronic headaches. Things are not looking good for Spector at this point. He is credited for developing the âWall of Soundâ recording technique used when mixing pop music in the 1960âs. Several women who have been in relationships with Spector say he had a tendency to be violent, and he sometimes threatened them with a gun. Perhaps Clarkson, whose most famous role was in the 1985 film âBarbarian Queen,â angered Spector enough that night to make his threats a reality.

Steve Tilley looks at Gadgets. Check out his last Gadgets column here. Thu, May 31, 2007 Rogen on a high Canadian causing quite a buzz LOS ANGELES -- The most unlikely leading man of the summer is a deep-voiced young Canadian, somewhat less bulky than Shrek, and possessed of a fine, curly head of hair (a "Jewfro" as he calls it). And his take on his first on-screen love scene -- with the lovely Katherine Heigl -- is not exactly what you'd hear from Brad Pitt. "It's really kind of nerve-racking," Seth Rogen says of his onscreen lovemaking in the hilarious Knocked Up. "If I was 18-years-old, that would literally be as far as I ever went with a girl. "You're essentially dry-humping a girl -- I don't know if I can say that or not, but I'm going to say it -- who you don't know very well. And I was just afraid I was going to sweat on her, a great gob of sweat on to her forehead." There, in that amiably provocative, utterly honest statement, is the essence of Rogen's character, both onscreen and off. It's how he came off in his scene-stealing role as the pot-smoking, porn-fan buddy in The 40 Year Old Virgin (directed by his best friend and mentor, Judd Apatow, who convinced him to move from Vancouver at age 16 to join the cast of his TV series, Freaks And Geeks). And it's Rogen in spades in Knocked Up, which he co-wrote with Apatow, a comedy about a beautiful, ambitious TV entertainment reporter (Heigl) who becomes pregnant from a drunken one-night-stand with a pot-smoking slacker and tries to salvage the situation and give the guy a chance. In a summer of overblown sequels, it's being tagged as another sleeper hit a la The 40 Year Old Virgin. In Knocked Up, Rogen even plays a Jewish twentysomething from Vancouver named Seth. "Having no real skills, I always try to play characters close to myself," Rogen says, "(as for being cast as Canadian), I still say 'sorry' instead of 'saw-ry' and Judd is just tired of editing around it." The slacker part, however, is just acting. In fact, the preternaturally-talented Rogen began performing standup in Vancouver at 13, and with a friend at 14 began writing Superbad, the comedy about his high school that's finally being released in August. (In a classy touch of verisimilitude, he's had many of his old schoolmates at Vancouver's Point Grey Secondary sign releases so he could use their actual names in the film). "Someone gave me a tape of actors reading generic scenes for Freaks And Geeks, and Seth was really funny and seemed real," Apatow said. "You could just see the light was on him. He'd think things only a great comic would think of, even at 16-years-old. It was like he was born a fully-formed comedic personality. So when that got cancelled we did (the short-lived series) Undeclared, and I made him a writer." More importantly, Rogen joined the gang of Apatow-related actors and writers known as the Frat Pack (whose ranks include Will Ferrell, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell, etc. and Freaks And Geeks veterans like James Franco). "Looking back, it was just a great show and we all got along really well," Rogen says. "I think that's why we all want to keep working together." (Other F And G alumnus in Knocked Up include Jason Segel and Martin Starr, real-life best friends playing Seth's best friends). "I just finished a movie with James Franco (The Pineapple Express, which Rogen wrote and in which he co-stars), and we just kept looking at each other and said, 'If you told us eight years ago they'd allow us to be in a movie that we're the stars of, I'd never have believed it."

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/arts/television/31watc.html&cid The Starter Wife - Army Wives - TV Watch - New York Times Social Climbing to Starting Over: A First Wifes Lot Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 31, 2007 Feminism didnt bridge the divide between men and women, it broke the barriers separating best friends. Skip to next paragraph Paul A. Broben/USA Network Peter Jacobson, left, Debra Messing and Joe Mantegna in this new USA mini-series. In the Magazine: Gigi's Novel Life In a new reality show, Marla Maples, center, is counselor to Kevin, whose wife had an affair. Kim Delaney and Brian McNamara as husband and wife in this new Lifetime series. Betty Friedan made the suburbs safe for sisterhood. By the time Sex and the City rolled around, female bonding  especially over fancy cocktails  was as much a part of popular culture as fishing trips and fraternity hazing rites. The fact that nowadays women are allowed to like one another, even at the expense of men, is at the core of ladies-night hits like Greys Anatomy. So atavistic series like The Bachelor and Desperate Housewives that play down female camaraderie and instead showcase hissy fits and catfights have a naughty, contrarian tang. That retro allure is what drives tonights premiere of The Starter Wife, a USA mini-series that explores the plight of the discarded Hollywood socialite. Its a satire-lite soufflé that follows all the steps of the chick-lit recipe. (If Jane Eyre were written according to todays rules, the orphaned governess would be dragged to a bar by two female friends and a gay male pal and plied with mixed drinks and pool boys until she forgot all about Mr. Rochester and his mad starter wife.) (Will & Grace) plays Molly Kagan, whose studio mogul husband, Kenny (Peter Jacobson), tells her by cellphone that he wants a divorce. Based on a best-selling novel by Gigi Levangie Grazer, the wife of the Hollywood producer , The Starter Wife is a throwback to The Women, Clare Boothe Luces 1936 play about divorce among the rich and pampered. The Starter Wife is set in Malibu and Brentwood, not Park Avenue, so its also a lot like the 1940s radio show Mary Noble, Backstage Wife and the novels of Jackie Collins. These kinds of tell-all tales mix satirical flicks at the follies of the rich and famous (Kenny prepares their young daughter for school by saying, Dont forget to share your cookies with Violet Affleck) with the voyeuristic spectacle of grown-up women channeling their inner Mean Girls. All soap operas centered on women include vixens and villainesses, so the difference lies mainly in the proportion. Molly Kagan has a few loyal female friends  and a gay decorator  but the juice of her tale comes from the snooty, gossiping frienemies who snub her in restaurants and kick her off charity committees when she loses her status as The Wife of. And the beauty of cable lies in the gradation of expectations. On premium networks like HBO or Showtime, The Starter Wife would seem trite and a little too obvious. On USA, its an escapist hoot. The Starter Wife serves as a comic chaser to Army Wives, a more serious, and surprisingly engrossing, Lifetime series on Sunday about what happens to spouses left on base when their soldiers are deployed to combat zones (a lot). Its a little like The Unit, the CBS drama about an elite team of commandos and their wives, but the focus of this Lifetime drama is on the women behind the men in uniform. Army Wives, which stars , examines women of varying age, rank and serial blunder who come together under the stress of military life  and the needling of a few bad women. Not all the bonding spouses are female, however. One member of the clique is an army psychiatrist whose wife returns from a two-year rotation in Afghanistan with a bad case of post-traumatic stress disorder. Female solidarity  or the lack of it  seems to be a popular theme this summer. ABC even ordered up a reality show, Ex-Wives Club, featuring Marla Maples, the former Mrs. ; Angie Everhart, who was once engaged to ; and Shar Jackson, who is the mother of two of Kevin Federlines children and who lost him to . Those three professional exes lend their expertise to ordinary people who are suffering the pain of rejection. Their methods can be brutal. On the premiere, the scornees are sent to a life coach, Debbie Ford, who runs an emotional boot camp in Palm Springs, Calif. The schedule begins early: 8:00 a.m.  Anger. But the founding members of Ex-Wives Club also offer empathy. Ms. Maples was careful in the first episode on Monday to speak well of her ex-husband, but at times she couldnt resist a lateral dig. Ms. Maples helps Kevin, a would-be mortgage broker, organize a networking party in the real estate community. I did this so many years with my ex-husband, she replies when he thanks her. And to be here with someone like you who appreciates it ... Tearing up, she breaks off. Molly could use that kind of support. Instead, when Kenny dumps her for a sexy young pop singer named Shoshanna, Molly finds herself shunned by her fellow worshipers at what she calls the Church of Perpetual Upkeep. After losing her gym membership and even her coveted spot in a Mommy and Me class, she runs away. Not far, however. She retreats to the Malibu house of her oldest and hardest-drinking friend, Joan ( ), who has entered rehab. Lonely, Molly befriends the security guard, Lavender (Anika Noni Rose of Dreamgirls), who is preoccupied with college loans, not collagen. Mollys decorator, Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos), sticks by her, but Cricket (Miranda Otto) is torn. Her husband is a director of blockbuster comedies who wants Kennys studio to back a serious film, The Dutch Bureaucrats Son, and doesnt want Kenny to think he and Cricket side with Molly. It doesnt take long for Cricket to come to her senses. Mollys senses are divided between the flirty overtures of her husbands boss, Lou ( ), and a buff Malibu beach bum, Sam (Stephen Moyer). Army Wives is a street-smart homage to those who also serve because they stand and wait. The Starter Wife is not exactly groundbreaking social satire, but its a sassy look at those who stand behind their Hollywood men, and are waited upon by servants.

Lindsay Lohan's latest round of trouble has reportedly ended with her checking into rehab again. "Lindsay admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility on Memorial Day," a representative for the singer/actress said in a statement published on TMZ.com Tuesday afternoon (May 29). "Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation and respect the privacy of Lindsay as well as the other patients receiving treatment at the facility." Various reports put Lohan &#8212; who made a seemingly failed attempt to get sober during a stint in rehab earlier this year &#8212; packing off to Malibu, California's Promises facility, the same place where Britney Spears completed a program several months ago (see "Britney Back In Rehab Yet Again" ). Lohan's publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnick, did not return several calls and e-mails to MTV News seeking confirmation on Lohan's whereabouts. Early Saturday morning, Lohan was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence after smashing her car into a tree and a curb while speeding down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles (see "Lindsay Lohan Arrested On Suspicion Of Driving Under Influence" Then on Tuesday, prior to TMZ.com posting the statement from Lohan's representative, New York's ran photos of the star seemingly passed out Monday in a friends' car after another night of partying. The photos depict Lohan &#8212; who reportedly spent Sunday night barhopping with friends &#8212; alternately with her eyes closed, mouth hanging open and slumped in the front seat of a car wearing a hooded sweatshirt. In one she is seen kneeling on the pavement outside the car. Also on Tuesday, Beverly Hills Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Mitch McCann told MTV News that the toxicology tests on Lohan could take four to eight weeks to complete, but that in addition to the misdemeanor driving under the influence charge, possible felony charges could be added if it is determined that the substance believed to be cocaine found in the smashed vehicle belonged to Lohan. Additionally, because Lohan is still a month away from her 21st birthday, if it is determined that she was intoxicated while driving, she could also face charges for underage drinking, McCann said. Police believe Lohan was driving at a "high rate of speed" when the accident occurred, but McCann said a reconstruction of the scene has not yet definitely determined how fast she was traveling.

See a photo you want? Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Wed, May. 30, 2007 reprint or license this Young lady, go to your room So I wasn&#0039;t going to go there, but there she was again, Lindsay Lohan, the human SUV-wreck, crashing her way literally through the holiday weekend, honoring our brave soldiers in her inimitable fashion. Lohan is now more famous for her appearances in the tabloids than for those on screen. When a celebrity becomes identified for consistently bad behavior rather than good acting, the work dries up at precisely the time the paparazzi leap into overdrive. Lohan turns out to take a tremendous tab photo in all hair colors, though the weekend snaps (blond) aren&#0039;t headed for any keepsake album. Lohan was cited for a DUI - the tart&#0039;s diploma of choice - after crashing her Mercedes in Beverly Hills on Saturday. Traces of cocaine were found in the car though not, as yet, in her. Not providing the tabloids quite enough fodder for a traditionally slow news cycle, Lohan gave a command performance Memorial Day, falling outside a club before passing out in her SUV while forgoing a seat belt, clearly the preferred form of safety negligence for the famous. In a sad, ironic twist, three medallions claiming 30-days sobriety swung from the vehicle&#0039;s rear-view mirror. Lohan reportedly checked into rehab Tuesday. Promises - sounds like a feminine-hygiene spray - is dubbed "the Ritz of Rehab." It promotes "healing and luxury," ideal in a spa but counterproductive for detox. This marks five months since Lohan&#0039;s last rehab tour and four months after pal Britney Spears spent time at the $48,000-a-month Malibu facility. LiLo turns 21 on July 2. Understandably, Svedka Vodka pulled out as a sponsor of a planned two-day party extravaganza in Las Vegas celebrating her legal right to drink, an achievement for which Lohan appears to have been studying as assiduously as her peers might prep for the LSAT. Meanwhile, Paris Hilton, the third "Bimbo of the Apocalpyse," as the New York Post dubs them ("No clues, no cares, no underwear"), is scheduled to check into the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood Tuesday for 23 days, after violating terms of her DUI probation. The correctional institution promises neither healing nor luxury. Hilton is scheduled for release in time to f&#0234;te Lohan - that is, if they&#0039;re friends at that moment. OK, so they&#0039;re wrecks and gossip fodder, but the problem is they seem to be aspirational models for young women who would be better off without them. Over the holiday weekend, it was possible to see an endless parade of teenagers and tweeners aping the Bimbos of the Apocalypse slatternly attire at the shore. Bimb-Apo style favors low baby-doll tops, obvious strappage, tight shorts, occasional thong eruptions and those egregious, oversized bug sunglasses, usually white or metallic, which I thought experienced their sad moment in the sun two years ago, although clearly I was wrong. The glasses have the misguided effect of making the head, and its contents, appear very, very small while the vanity of the affectation seems too grand and important for the wearer. Only Jacqueline Onassis and Audrey Hepburn could get away with such an emphatic sartorial gesture. Meanwhile, I am sorry to report, that cryptic messages posted on posteriors have not gone away. I don&#0039;t know why people want strangers reading their chests, let alone "Princess" on their rears. Four summers ago, when "your ad here" shorts first appeared, I thought it would amount to but a blip in bad taste. Here, I am sorry to report, I was wrong, too. Bad taste is like a cockroach. You can&#0039;t kill it, and it will just multiply. It&#0039;s unclear to me why lovely girls want to mimic vapid strumpets whose greatest talents are for trashy behavior, tabloid portraiture, rehab and perp walks. I thought Paris would go away. And she will, but only for 23 days. I thought Lindsay would go away, and she will, too, but only promises to go to Promises and then she&#0039;ll be back. I was smart enough to know that Britney is never, ever, ever going away. I miss the plucky redhead Lindsay of before she found a misguided calling of creating 48-hour news cycles of continued crack-ups.

"I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on `American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. Paula Abdul poses for photographers before the Thrive Fall 2007 fashion show during the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week at Smashbox Studios in Culver City, Calif., in a Thursday, March 22, 2007 photo.

(AP Photo/Matt Sayles, file) (Matt Sayles - AP) A look at the famous faces making headlines in movies, music and more. Save & Share Article Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of `American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul _ who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s _ says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of `American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer."

News - Spector Trial: Coroner Reasserts Homicide Ruling Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Spector Trial: Coroner Reasserts Homicide Ruling Wed, 30 May 2007 09:13:55 PM PDT It was another busy day for Phil Spector&#39;s defense team as it tried to take the prosecution&#39;s latest witness down a notch. The Los Angeles doctor who performed Lana Clarkson&#39;s autopsy wasn&#39;t biting, however. In his second day on the stand, deputy county coroner Louis Pena, who testified yesterday that Clarkson&#39;s death was a homicide, said under cross-examination that gunshot residue found on the alleged victim&#39;s hands does not necessarily indicate that she shot herself. Spector&#39;s camp is maintaining that the gunshot wound to the mouth that killed the actress was self-inflicted. Clarkson died in the hallway of Spector&#39;s Alhambra mansion in the early morning of Feb. 3, 2003. "It implies the person could have been holding the weapon or been in the vicinity when the weapon was discharged," Pena said, demonstrating how this is possible by placing his hands around his face and chest to show how gunshot residue could land on a person even if someone else pulled the trigger. Additionally, when defense attorney Christopher Plourd asked Pena if, in his experience, one could always find gunshot residue on the hands of a person who has just fired a gun, the coroner answered, "Not always." Pena testified Tuesday that a combination of physical and circumstantial evidence led to his ruling the death a homicide, including his impression that Clarkson was a "hopeful" person who did not seem as if she were considering suicide. One of the circumstances that contributed to his decision, he said, was that the right-handed Clarkson&#39;s body was found with her leopard-skin handbag draped over her right shoulder. "It bothered me a lot that she had her purse on her right shoulder," Pena said yesterday. "It&#39;s difficult for someone to take a weapon and shoot herself with the purse staying on her shoulder. It should be off." "She could have had a self-inflicted wound and the purse could have stayed on her shoulder, is that true?" Plourd asked Wednesday. "Yes, that&#39;s possible," Pena replied, but again said that the "totality of the circumstances" pointed toward her death being a homicide. "The only time you talked on the record about the purse being significant was yesterday, is that correct?" Plourd pressed. "Yes," Pena said, adding that, although it wasn&#39;t included in his notes or official reports, he had also brought it up briefly at a meeting once. Plourd then questioned the coroner about any mistakes his office may have made during the investigation. Pena said that one dental investigator did, indeed, drop a vial containing one of Clarkson&#39;s teeth, breaking the vial and losing the tooth in the process. The vial was taped up and returned to Pena, but the investigator didn&#39;t tell him about the incident until several months later. Tackling Pena&#39;s statements about the bruising found on Clarkson&#39;s arm, her hand and on the side of her tongue, indicating that the gun had been forced into her mouth, Plourd asked whether the bruise in her mouth could have been caused by a bullet. The doctor said that such an occurrence was "not normally seen." Pena did admit, however, that there was no real way to tell how fresh the bruises on Clarkson&#39;s arms, hands and legs were, especially considering the pain medications she had been taking at the time could cause a person to bruise easily. Prosecutors also showed the jury a photograph of Clarkson&#39;s bloodstained right hand, which showed that part of her acrylic thumbnail was missing. The Los Angeles District Attorney&#39;s Office has alleged that defense expert Henry Lee found a piece of nail&mdash;which could mean that a struggle took place&mdash;at the scene of the alleged crime and that the defense never shared the evidence with the prosecution. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler ruled last week that Lee did withhold something from prosecutors, although he couldn&#39;t say for sure if it was a fingernail or not. After the jury was excused today, Fidler rejected the defense&#39;s motion to limit testimony about this allegedly lost piece of fingernail. Plourd&#39;s cross-examination lasted all morning and is scheduled to resume tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. He also asked Pena a lot of questions about his seemingly high regard for defense experts Vincent DiMaio and Werner Spitz, the latter of whom authored a textbook that Pena had consulted during his investigation. Meanwhile, the usual horde of reporters covering the trial thinned out today, perhaps taking a breather while the two sides rehash the forensic minutiae of the case.

(AP Photo/Katsumi Kasahara) By DAVID GERMAIN AP Movie Writer LOS ANGELES May 28, 2007 (AP) "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" hauled in $142.1 million to commandeer the record for best Memorial Day weekend debut, capping a huge month that puts Hollywood on track for record summer business. Disney's third "Pirates" adventure fell far short of breaking the best three-day opening ever, the $151.1 million haul for Sony's "Spider-Man 3" three weeks earlier, according to studio estimates Monday. Movie Buff? Talk To Joel Siegel Yet "At World's End" cruised past last year's record for best four-day Memorial Day opening, $122.9 million for "X-Men: The Last Stand." Compared to its predecessor in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies, the $115.1 million that "At World's End" drew from Friday to Sunday was well behind the $135.6 million premiere last summer of "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," the second-biggest debut ever. Chuck Viane, Disney's head of distribution, said "At World's End" had been a longshot to break top box-office records. The movie runs two hours, 47 minutes, about 15 minutes longer than "Dead Man's Chest" and almost half an hour longer than "Spider-Man 3." That limited the number of screenings theaters could fit in. "Dead Man's Chest" and "Spider-Man 3" also opened amid lighter competition, while "At World's End" was up against "Spider-Man 3" and DreamWorks Animation's "Shrek the Third." "This is probably the most competitive Memorial weekend ever if not one of the most competitive weekends all time. It speaks volumes for how well we did," Viane said. "Obviously, we fell short of the three-day record of 'Spidey.' Everything's really obvious and really good." Adding in $14 million from Thursday night previews before its official Friday release, "At World's End" had taken in $156.1 million domestically. The movie also grossed $245 million internationally since Wednesday, putting its worldwide total at $401 million in a matter of days. The movie picks up where "Dead Man's Chest" left off, with Johnny Depp's wily pirate Jack Sparrow consigned to Davy Jones' locker and his old associates embarking on a rescue mission. `Pirates' Breaks Memorial Day Record Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

"I couldn't stop smiling - I had such a ball being up there. "There were a few that were really devastated, which was a bit heartbreaking to see, but you just had to remind them that life's huge and this is just one little thing in their lives." The small-town girl from Queensland said she was shocked by the competitive nature of the South Americans and the round-the-clock, heavily made-up glamour of many of the contestants.

Morning Mix: Woman Offers to Serve Time for Paris Queen? Bah. The Dutchess Visits Virginia Morning Mix: Lohan Checks Into Rehab Go Away, Lindsay Lohan chat each Thursday at 2 p.m. ET. Listen to Liz live Mon., Wed. and Fri. at 8:20 a.m. on Post Radio, 107.7 FM/1500 AM ( Have a tip or suggestion? Add This Blog To: Go Away, Lindsay Lohan Lindsay Lohan, she's got the whole world in her hands. (Reuters) The story of the day may well become the story of the year. Lindsay Lohan has acquired the dubious distinction of being the latest in a string of celebutantes to Paris Hilton was recently sentenced to an incredible-shrinking-jail-term for violating her DUI probation and Nicole Richie's fate will be decided in court on June 8 after her own for driving under the influence of alcohol, Vicodin and pot. Lohan's moment came in the wee hours of Saturday morning when the 20-year-old reportedly crashed her convertible Mercedes SL-65 into a curb around 5:30 a.m. Lohan was spirited away from the scene by friends. Cops later located the starlet at L.A.'s Century City Hospital and charged her with suspicion of DUI. They haven't yet decided who will face charges for the cocaine found in the vehicle. And, rather than keep a low profile in the wake of what is an undeniably sticky mess, a seemingly intoxicated (think buffalo tranquilizer) Lohan was spending her Memorial Day alternately incoherent and retching. Maybe it was Lohan's way of going out with a bang? If tabloid reports are to be believed, she may check herself in to Malibu's Promises rehab center by day's end (lately vacated by erstwhile sloppy drunk Britney Spears). Despite the tornadic vortex that is Lohan's nonstop party, she remains a working actress. A few weeks ago she walked the red carpet with Jane Fonda to promote their new movie "Georgia Rule." In late July, the actress stretches way out to play a stripper in the thriller "I Know Who Killed Me." Last week, Lohan said she'll spend the summer working on a new "urban pop" album and she's already lined up her next acting gig -- she'll continue with her serious actress/chick flick trajectory by co-starring with Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine in the dramedy " Is it naive that I'm mystified by Lohan's virus-like ability to attach herself to projects? Sure, perennial addict Robert Downey Jr. (now clean, by the way) got chance after chance after chance, but he was and is an incredible actor. And, in the age of celeb-reality, even some of Hollywood's biggest trainwrecks continue to pull a paycheck and our attention. Both Danny Bonaduce and Tom Sizemore scored reality shows based on their rapidly imploding lives. Maybe this "12,000 strikes and you're never out" policy sends the wrong message to young stars and those who emulate them. Maybe -- just maybe -- what Lohan needs is a cold shoulder, a little tough love that she's not likely to get from mom Dina (who "This [premieres and parties] is the fun part of the business. She'll be 21 in a few months. Regardless, of course, as a parents, you set boundaries and scold them. But there are these dark stories -- she is so misunderstood. All she wants to do is act and have a somewhat normal life. When you're 20, it's normal to want to go to The Ivy, to go to the hot stores. She can't live in a bubble.") or creepy dad Michael, who calls in his fatherly advice to the New York Daily News. Hollywood honchos -- who probably aren't reading this blog -- stop hiring this sick young woman. Not only will it give her an opportunity to heal herself and gain some much needed perspective, it will hammer home the lesson that if you behave like you, too, will share in his fate.

Posted by: methinks AM A few days in rehab is Hollywood's answer to anything. And we buy it. Posted by: A Few Days AM For the life of me I can't figure out why this girl is famous. She's an unremarkable actress, not spectacularly gorgeous, and can't sing that great. I guess she's pretty good at being a trainwreck. Posted by: boutros AM Lindsay needs to hang a picture of Anna Nicole Smith on her mirror so she can be constantly reminded what happened to that party girl. At the rate Lindsay is going she won't see 25, let alone 39. Since 12 steps seems a bit complicated for her, I got 3: 1. Get away from Mother -- NOW. 2. Stop going to clubs. Period. 3. Do not have an alcohol company sponsor your 21st Birthday Party. Posted by: ep AM I follow this trainwreck much too closely for my own good, but I'm always stumped on how these LA, NY, and Vegas "establishments" are not brought down for serving minors like Lohan...how is it we hear of her "partying late into the night" at X, yet she and some of her pals are under-age. Why is no one coming down on these bars and clubs? Posted by: Jay in DC AM I think we're all missing the real victim in this story: That car has been bent and dented. It will NEVER be the same. It will go through the rest of its life with an insurance claim on its record and anyone will be able to read about it on Carfax. Please, won't somebody think of the car? Posted by: byoolin AM boutros, my thoughts exactly. Posted by: st.louis AM she was in Mean Girls and then....? what has she done since then that was of any distinction? Herbie, Fully Loaded (should have been Lilo, Fully Loaded). I am baffled. Posted by: AM Maybe she can't live in a bubble, but she can call a cab or hire a driver when she's drunk. Her mother says she is "misunderstood". Maybe the right word is "exploited by parents." Posted by: POS AM "For the life of me I can't figure out why this girl is famous" She is famous because the Media made her famous. They follow her around all day long until she trips up then they got a story. She is what you call a cash-cow. If the media wasn't around the poor girl would probably straighten out her life. Posted by: Voted most famous AM I don't feel sorry for Lindsay. She is only going to rehab in hopes of getting probation for the DWI charge and possible felony cocaine charge. She and her enablers (aka Mom and Dad) do not take her drinking problem seriously. Posted by: Lisa1 AM LL, like her famous cohorts, are symbols of our declining popular culture. Young people admire and emulate this behavior. Its poisonous. Yet they avoid the natural consequences that others would expect. The behavior is tolerated in Hollywood, just as the negative behavior of professional athletes is tolerated by our society. Posted by: Renee AM I always find photos like those so disturbing... she's totally out of it and it is gross. I'm so sick and tired of all those stupid little rich girls who are famous because the media thinks they deserve to be. Oh poor them... rich and nothing to do with their time or money but get drunk and crash cars. Thank goodness I had actual real women to look up to while I was growing up and hope to steer my daughter in that direction as well. Posted by: Mama AM Shame on these celebrity rehab places that stress the former and not the latter. I know people without a dime who desperately need rehab but can't get in because there aren't any beds available, yet these stars walk in and out as if these centers were a Starbucks. Sure, Lindsay is free to leave, but if these rehab places are serious, they should do everything in their power to convince her to stay. Lohan's dad is too easy to make fun of, but he's right in that she needs extensive help for her problem. That she is a celebrity makes it no less so. Posted by: JD AM It's also amazing how much her partying is ageing her. In recent photos I've seen of Lindsay, she looks to be in her thirties; people think she and her mother are near the same age because Lindsay looks older as opposed to Dina looking younger. Posted by: Caprice AM It's hard to feel much sympathy for LiLo. She's been a working actress for much of her life-- an environment that promotes self-destructive behavior-- but seems to have a family that *facilitates* craziness rather than reining it in. I also don't feel that she's such a talent that her "star power" will outshine the clear drawbacks of hiring her (i.e., negative publicity, questionable professional behavior, etc.). If her ability to pull in tween audiences starts to fall (and I think it will, soon), she won't find as many offers coming across her agent's desk. Her best bet is to clean up and get professional about her career, and fast. Posted by: DB AM - I too am baffled by her ability to get jobs. You would think that since she doesn't have a trust fund and has to work for a living (that can be debated) she wouldn't sully her reputation. - Someone in her crew thought to move the car while a camera crew filmed the whole thing. There is dumb and then there's LiLo and her friends. Orange jumpsuits for all of them. Posted by: petal AM DUI? How about leaving the scene of an accident? That is against the law here in MD. How about in CA? The "drugs in the car" can be beat by a public attorney with wet ink on his diploma: No concrete evidence trail. Add in the fact the paparrazi was on the scene and LL can (and probably would) testify drunk to beat that charge. Her mom sure likes riding the gravy trail her daughter is providing, doesn't she? LL is going the route of ANS and LL's mom will be the first to write a book after the funeral. Heck, she probably has everything but the ending already written. Posted by: SoMD AM The thing about Lilo - similar to what DB said - is that she is really suffering from the child star syndrome somewhat. Since those cute little twin lindseys in parent trap to train wreck. And the actors she works with Do say she has some tallent. Maybe one of these days she'll clean up her act and we can see that side of her again. Posted by: sjcpeach AM What're the odds on her surviving the next six months? Posted by: bouttime PM I think that if some of these girls actually stayed the course and went through rehab that they would come out on the other end in a much better position. Unfortunately none of them actually do! The party seems to continue whether they are in or out of rehab. Someday movie producers will wise up and not hire them, unfortunately its people like us who keep reading about them that make the whole situation possible. I must admit that I love to read about it, so I am as much a part of the problem I guess. Personally, I would like her to really get the help she needs. I wish all of them would. Posted by: In DC PM this whole drug infestation is getting, OLD. Cops need to take their show to Hollywood, the DEA needs to wreak havoc in hollywood...come on its getting to ridiculous, itz either this girl needs to sober up or die. Posted by: me PM People can say what they will. The bottom line is that I do not support the work of people who cannot live a life of principles and decency. Fun is one thing, endagering the lives of others is another. Next time you support LL, think about the thousands of lives cut short by intoxicated drivers just like her. Posted by: Decency PM What's really unfortunate is that she doesn't seem to have anyone who is legitimately in her corner. Self-interested father and oblivious mommy don't seem capable of helping her to recognize that she's in the process of killing herself and needs help, now. She's on her own, and unless she takes hold of this opportunity to start coming to grips with her addiction--who else but an addict gets a DUI on Saturday and falls out drunk on Monday?--she may not see her 22nd birthday. Posted by: JanetK PM Is Lindsey like Anna Nicole Smith or more like Drew Barrymore? Drew was a total trainwreck in her teen years too - with a mom she had to divorce to get away from and it took her a long time to clean herself up. But all along, she too was touted as having some talent and look at her career now. Have things really changed in Hollywood or are we engaging in selective memory? Posted by: anonymous PM Daddy Lohan didn't call in his advice. He gave it in a face-to-face interview. Posted by: erouen PM I guess she is about one year away from doing pr0nz on the interwebs. Posted by: Bubbie PM when i said i felt sorry for her, it was because i know how difficult it is to stay sober. heck, it's difficult to realize you need help. janetk is absolutely correct, there appears to be no one willing to stand up and help her out of love for her rather than some sort of self interest. liz's assertion, that the hollywood types need to stop hiring her, is a sound one. she needs time, and maybe a loss of income and prestige, to get to the point where she's willing to make a significant life change. the sad thing is, she's likely to get much worse before she gets better. and, optimist that i am, then it might be too late. Posted by: methinks PM When are the Lindsay's, Paris's and Nicole's going to realize the laws are made for them also. Maybe if they all got sent to boot camp or wilderness camp then maybe they would wake up. One thing though, there are more important things going on in this world other than Lindsay, Paris and Nicole lives.

Posted by: txgrandma PM On a slightly different subject, I'd like to know why the writer of this article calls LL's father "creepy". His comments seemed perfectly reasonable to me. Is it because he mentioned God? Is that what "creepy" means to Washington Post writers? Posted by: Burt PM Back to your boring lives, TV America. You are why Lohan's famous. Posted by: PM I don't care what Linsey Lohan does. She played a cute high school kid in Mean Girl's. That's it. Now if she wants to wrap her head around a telephone pole, that's entirely up to her. Go for it Lohan. The press would love that one. Posted by: Woodie PM Lindsay Lohan. Sexy hell yeah i'd hit it. Posted by: kevin PM it is so depressing on so many levels -- the mother posing in the back of a stretch limo for harpers & talking about how she takes ll's old clothes, the dad (& yeah - in jail for assault is "creepy", never mind the God part), & the endless stories, pictures, etc. - but what's worse is that even if lindsey were to disappear tomorrow, there would be ten thousand girls who'd be happy to take her place...she isn't an actress. she's a creation, a product. when she stops selling, she'll be dropped. Posted by: abd PM ya know what i'd like to see is somthing real happen. no matter how much celeberty and money thease people have just one of them get some serious concequences as a result of getting busted. 45 days??? I'd got at least a year. what happend to mandatory minimums?I want to see Paris or Lindsy serve like at least a year and a severe probation. I'd probablly lose my job. would Lindsy?? NO she'd work because her employer can't afford to just hire a talented undiscovered talent that would work better. nope gotta have Lohan! drunk or sober. and I also gotta say she is a "butterface" she has (or had) a kick ass body.....but her face??? so whats so gr8?? Beautiful people everywhere...and were stuck with her??? Yep it's a beautiful world!!! the law is so blind and unbiased. Hollywood, please hire somone fresh and new! give someone deserving a chance! Posted by: we are all DEVO PM Wasn't her father in prison for a good amount of time? Wasn't it for drinking and driving? And he's a real winner in the personality department, from what I recall. And Burt, I don't think mentioning God would cause anyone to consider you "creepy", but that was a good try to pigeonhole the WP as "evil, leftist, and anti-religion". Bonus points to you for being creative. ; ) Posted by: Maritza PM 1. We admiited we were powerless over alcohol--that our lives had become unmanageable. There is a way...may you find it (before you die) Posted by: Steve F. PM I'm feeling cynical today, so I'm just going to say it: I believe our CULTURE, not just celebrities, is suffering badly from the "12,000 strikes and your never out" policy. There are a lot of people who are never held accountable ... from the White House to the average kid. Posted by: It's depressing, but ... PM Posted by: bobo PM This girl is great. Let her figure stuff out and please pass the popcorn Posted by: ACP PM "Maybe this "12,000 strikes and your [sic] never out" policy sends the wrong message to young stars and those who emulate them." I think it's not just that they're never out, it's that because of this kind of drama, they're topping the list of Maxim's hottest 100. They're being glorified and simultaneously condemned for it. Talk about mixed signals. I'm so over LL. Posted by: Jagshemash PM Lindsey, Paris, Rosie, etl....It must be a "slow" news summer. Celebrity antics are rampant along with celebrity squabbles...not to mention everyone and his brother giving their "expert" advice and/or giving their "opinion" as expert advice...everyone should "take a breath"...Law breakers are law breakers. Opinions are...well you know... It seems that "any publicity is good publicity" is the only concern nowadays.. Sad for us....Sadder for them.. Posted by: EnoughAllReady PM I agree that enough is enough with these vulgar girls. She's obviously extremely desperate for attention or she wouldn't live her entire life in front of the cameras. You can tell she loves it because she constantly poses. She needs to be ignored - only then will she get help. What I can't understand is why an underage minor has been drinking all around town, photographed in an out of clubs that minors aren't allowed in, yet the police and authorities in Los Angeles aren't cracking down.

Posted by: hj PM If Liz Kelly really wanted Lindsay Lohan to disappear, she would stop writing about her. Let's face it, the drug-addled antics of today's celebrities are what keeps her fed. When is the media going to take any responsibility for perpetuating the decline of public discourse in the US? The Post should fire Kelly and use the money to hire another beat reporter. Posted by: the rza PM Is this really worth our time??? While we have a military stretched to the breaking point and a declining health car system, educational system (nearly 50% high school drop out rate), social security system, medicare care system, transportation system, a polarized congress and an administration that prefers to violate our rights rather than protect them (just to name a few of our problems), we consider Lohan, Hilton, Trump, O'Donnell etc. to be "newsworthy". I wonder if a couple of thousand years ago some Romans were sitting around and saying "What the hell went wrong?" Posted by: B L PM Lindsey L. is an extreme example of a very common problem in AA. Drunk tries to get sober for the wrong reasons, never hits bottom, never really sees their own drinking problem, doesn't address underlying issues (usually extreme self-hatred and fear), drinks until life-changing event occurs. That usually results in long stays in jails or hospitals. If she doesn't stop drinking then the diagnosis is usually death, slow and painful. What few people realize about alcoholism is that the people who suffer from it die from loss of blood. They poison their intestinal systems and it causes them to bleed from the inside out. Throwing up blood is common and bleeding rectally is an end stage symptom that signals death if the person is still mentally all there, which they usually are not. The good news for her is that this could be the beginning of the end of her active drinking, but the bad news is that she is probably going to spend some time behind bars. Celebrity or not, she can take herself out, but a judge will not continue to let her pose a risk to innocent drivers in LA. Good luck, Lyndsey. I hope to see you in an AA meeting someday. It would be inspiring to hear that you read this or someone close to you read it to you. I speak from experience and have been sober for over 17 years. Posted by: AAKen PM "Actress Lindsay Lohan continued to party over the holiday weekend, despite being arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. On Sunday she attended a Memorial Day pool party for 944 magazine at Hollywood's Roosevelt Hotel. She was also pictured apparently asleep or passed out in the passenger seat of her DJ friend Samantha Ronson's car later that morning. Miss Lohan dropped her sunglasses and cigarettes on her way out of the hotel, then collapsed when she bent to pick them up and a bouncer lifted her into the car, the New York Post reported" You go girl! Booze, Cocaine, Cancer Sticks, and who knows what else will have her dead before she hits 25. Posted by: lindsay coke_ho PM The key to Lindsay is the same as the key to all of us: look to the values and confidence instilled by parents and home life. Dina is a train wreck end every time she opens her mouth, it's more and more obvious why she's got a daughter spinning out of control. And Dad is so pathetic he's comical. There's no big mystery here. Keep following the tabloids - Lindsay has a younger sister and brother to be exploited, too.

Posted by: Sarah PM If you are not such a great actor that people will simply wait for and go see your next movie, you have to have a gig that will keep you in the public's short memory. Not everyone has the commitment necessary to fly around the world adopting children, or the money to start up schools in Africa, or the bad judgement to issue political statements. It is just easier to keep your picture in paper when you drink til you vomit, dance til you pass out, toss out your dignity and self-esteem with your panties, and go to rehab for forgiveness. Posted by: Paul Garneau PM I don't understand why she isn't just removed from the Hollywood limelight. Why wouldn't my 20-year-old daughter try to get away with drinking/driving/drug-taking if all of these celebrities get to walk away without any serious consequences. In a country of "equality" why do we allow these people to live by different standards? Instead we inherit a newly ruined former child-star who will distract us on from more important daily news stories. Thanks Disney! Posted by: JB PM I think Drew Barrymore should open a clinic and give advice to these former teen and child stars as to how she was able to get on with her life, away from addiction, and forge a very successful Hollywood career. Posted by: Jim PM Jim, if you only knew how many celebritiesmo as famous or more famous than Drew B. are "doing the work" as we say in AA, then you would know that these clinics are held about 2,200 times a week in Los Angeles county.

Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Nicole Richie and Lohan serve as endless fodder for my schadenfreude-entertainment. They are pathetic and miserable and bearing their angst for all the world to see. I can't WAIT till Lohan is found dead of a coke overdose, I can only hope it's from falling out of a 20-story building. Posted by: Xrys PM For my life I cannot understand Dina Lohan. She has been quoted quite a bit lately saying this is normal behavior for a girl this age. How can ANYONE standby and watch their daughter go down in flames like this. Lindsay has a serious problem, MOST parents would get their child help, not defend them, or assign blame. Linday = WORSE PARENTS EVER Posted by: Cherie PM When are the txgrandmas going to learn how to use the interwebs? And apostrophes? Also, wasn't LL a passenger? Maybe I heard wrong. Posted by: snotty lady PM 1. AA is for people who want it, not for people who need it. 2. There was a joke in AA making the rounds in the late 90's. A Hollywood producer was talking to a friend when she said she was late for her AA meeting. Her friend said, "I didn't know you were an alcoholic!!" The producer said, "I'm not. AA Meetings are where all the deals get done these days." 3. The celebrities aren't the problem, if you don't read about certain celebrities in the tabloids they probably go to AA. 4. AA saved my life. It is a hip place to hang. Posted by: AAKen PM AAKen I'm glad it worked for you & as you said, it's for those that want it. You can't force someone into it. Paul Petersen, of the Donna Reed show fame (showing my age but I saw the reruns on Nick @ Nite ages ago not in it's original run), started a group for kids like LiLo & the numerous others that have been victims of their parents greed & the machine that is Hollywood. It's called A Minor Consideration & I think the Lohans could use some of their help & I'm surprised they haven't yet commented anywhere on this whole mess. If they have I've missed it. Posted by: Bored @ work PM Doesn't LL have a little sister? Is she hiding out with the other normal relatives or will we soon also be seeing her demise into addiction? Save little lohan! Posted by: sjcpeach PM Why are any of you wasting your time blogging about Lindsay!!!! Save that to mourn for the poor victim who will be killed as a result of her driving under the influence because that's exactly what's going to happen if the court system continues to tap her on the wrist and send her back out with a bottle in her hand to drive away! She is set and ready to take somebody's life as a result of vehicular homicide. The police department and the court system -- along with her parents -- will share the blame along with her. It's just a matter of time before Nicole, Paris, Brittney or Lindsay kills somebody as a result of their DUI. My beloved uncle was killed that way and it makes me so angry that they are letting these girls get away with it. Check out the smirks on their faces. They're laughing at the system. Posted by: luv2laff11 PM You say "wasting time blogging about Lindsay," we say, "a pleasant afternoon baiting trolls." Posted by: byoolin PM To quote President Ronald Reagan, "Too bad spanking is out of fashion." In Ms. Lohan's case, she needs more of a mental "spanking" than a physical one, though both would do her good. I lost a wife and daughter at a very young age because of a drunk driver and that is the really sad part about the case of Ms. Lohan. It's not so much how she is destroying herself, but she may harm some innocent folks along her path of destruction; similar to a tornado out of control. She really needs help and in my opinion she is crying out for that help, but no one is listening. Most people are concentrating too much on "punishing" her instead of giving her the help she needs. The media is not focusing on what is CAUSING this girl to go to wild parties and feel she needs to drink until she is drunk. I hope someone or some people close to her can get her the help she needs to straighten out her life. She needs to be separated from the people surrounding her right now. They are not helping her, but encouraging her bad behavior. There are many rich girls in the world who do not behave in her manner and are responsible, law-abiding citizens. I don't buy this nonsense about bored, spoiled rich girls who don't know what to do with their money and go through phases of wild parties. Some women like Ivanka Trump have all the money they need and know how to act responsibly. Apparently Ms. Lohan has never had that guidance. I sure wish I could give her that guidance. We should be trying to help this girl more than ridiculing her and the first step is to get her off the streets. No more partying and hanging around with the wrong crowd is the first step. It's not just for her own life, but for the people around her as well. Posted by: Luca Brasi PM enough is enough it is time for all of us as people of this great sociaty to stop standing by and letting all this coruption continue to take place. Not just from the drunken celebrities,but from all the crime in our sociaty. We really need to take a hard look at all these law makers we have put into power. What have they done for the people lately. All of them are in bed together,money talks to money Posted by: Reggie of DC PM bwaaaaaa-hahahaha byoolin!! *sigh* my hero. Posted by: methinks PM Maybe my first sentence didn't come across well. I wasn't criticizing us bloggers because I wouldn't know about the blogging if I wasn't here myself. In essence I was saying all of our efforts are wasted on talking about Lindsay -- even though she's the subject -- because she's going to do what she wants to do anyway. She is surrounded by enablers who are afraid to speak up. I pray we never have to mourn her death or anyone else's, but if she insist on doing what she knows is wrong, somebody is going to pay a horrible, horrible price for it -- and all the money in the world will not bring that person back. Posted by: luv2laff11 PM Leave her alone. We are just watching Nature's way of proving Darwin's theory. Soon she will be culled from the breeding program and we all will be better for it. Posted by: pc PM Am I the only person that thinks she a good actress? Some very respected actors obviously think she's good - Meryl Streep, Felicity Huffman, Jane Fonda, etc. Posted by: pwa PM "Is it naive that I'm mystified by Lohan's virus-like ability to attach herself to projects? Sure, perennial addict Robert Downey Jr. (now clean, by the way) got chance after chance after chance, but he was and is an incredible actor." Lohan is also considered a very good actor--don't kid yourself, beyond all the tacky antics is some genuine talent. ROBERT ALTMAN cast her, for God's sake. And Meryl Streep sang her praises as well. It's frustrating as heck watching her drink away her talent, and her parents (although I don't doubt they love her) have not done right by her. The poster above who compared her to Drew Barrymore is dead on--let's hope she has the same trajectory. Posted by: NYC PM Let's face it, Lohan and Paris are what we've made them. We've stood back and chortled at this misfortune all the while feeding into it. Have you ever heard of negative reinforcement? Meanwhile, how many people get the fact that these girls are paid to attend parties. That's right, although they'd like you to believe that Paris makes her money on the runway and Lohan at the box office, they're actually paid large sums to go to parties (and bring the press with them) so they know exactly what they're doing and someone somewhere is paying them to vomit - always the sign of a good party, right? To see my solution (think Celebrity Drunk Tank) - read my blog today at http://www.somelikeitscott.com/2007.05.01_arch.html#1180455540163 And visit my site for more Scott at http://www.somelikeitscott.com/ Posted by: somelikeitscott PM Go away and stay away ........Not a good actress........ Posted by: los angeles PM I am at a loss for understanding what all the hub bub is about. Posted by: beautiful11 PM I am at a loss for understanding what all the hub bub is about. Posted by: beautiful11 PM i have to say, thats its a good thing what Happen TO LL, i myself got a DUI @the age of 20, now 24, i look back & think how dumb i was, time passes, people move on its nice to slow down, cause in the end no one is thier but you!! Posted by: EDDIE PM Make examples of all of them. Why is it that Joe Shmoe is kept out of a club for being underage but "celebrities" get a wink and a nod? Paris was a regular at LA, NYC and Miami clubs well before she was of legal age. I hope Lindsey gets professional help cause it sure isn't coming from her "parents". Posted by: Swankymodes PM Ms. Lohan has some serious problems but she is actually a talented actress. If you look at her early Disney work like "The Parent Trap" she clearly possesses great ability. Unfortunately she may be more like Bobby Driscoll than Paris Hilton. Driscoll was one of Walt Disney's favorite child actors, the voice of Peter Pan and actor in "Song of the South," "Treasure Island" and "The Window." He died penniless from drug abuse. Posted by: LAX PM I think I spotted a 'type O', don't you think it should be "urban pot"???? What a mess to come home to......... "Lohan said she'll spend the summer working on a new "urban pop" album and she's already lined up" Posted by: Copywriter PM this is the worst newspaper ever. congratulations! Posted by: bill PM She's a media pin-cushion and it will never go away. I looked up "Hollywood" in the dictionary: (2) A place where people bounce back and forth from rehab She needs to go to church, get saved, get real (funny how nobody says that anymore). Posted by: Aaron PM To all those thinking that rehab would help if they finish; I had a dear friend that had gone to rehab 8 times before the age of 25. What she needed wasn't just rehab to clean her out but family to be strong enough to say no to her. She started craving the drugs again and mom told her to go with her cousin because it would be safe if she "did it in her home." Guess what, she overdosed. Tough love could save so many people with addiction but society tells moms and dads that they can be their childs friend. Hells no. Posted by: Silver Springer PM thats whats its about, parents teach morals. America is in bad shape because parents are not parenting, not teaching morals. Parents teach you kids respect, spare the rod spoil the child. Posted by: morals PM I saw the pics. Lohan is just tired. Very VERY tired. And myopic. I know I always walk on all fours to find my glasses. Posted by: PM You got it right! Salvation got me permanently sober. Posted by: luv2laff11 PM Well, the real moral of this story is that the rich and famous DO live by a different set of rules than we do, and there is a huge industry feeding off their misbehavior. As "Jay in DC" asked, why aren't the cops going after the businesses who are publicly serving alcohol to minors? It's all about the money machine. Don't forget, every one of you just took the time to read this article, and eyeballs = money... Posted by: Steve PM You are absolutely right. If we stop adding fuel, the fire has to go out. Posted by: luv2laff11 PM God, so sad. She's got her 30-day chip around her neck. So sad. To the people posting glib comments about what she should or should not do. Addiction is far, far tougher than any of you are. It'll kick your ass from here to Mars and back. You have no idea. Posting comments is easy. Earning a 30-day chip is hard. Ask someone who's ever been an addict, or lived with one. I hope this apparent relapse turns out to be a milestone for her on her struggle to permanent sobriety. Posted by: Mark PM I'm sorry, but when the media - who report on this crap 24/7 instead of real news - tells Lindsay Lohan to "go away" ... well, that's just funny. You're the only ones who are keeping her in the spotlight. Posted by: Ed PM Alcoholics need to be trainwrecks before they are willing to stop drinking. They must hit bottom. How far down they fall is their own choice once they have been introduced to AA. a lot of ingnorance still exists about alcoholism. Please read the following carefully if you want to be part of the solution. Loss of family, loss of job, loss of business, loss of all support (emotional, physical, financial), and yes, even killing innocent bystanders in a tragic car accident or worse. For example, pilots flying commercial aircraft drunk, bus drivers, train engineers, ship captains. The Exxon Valdez disaster in Prince William Sound (worst ecological disaster in US history) was caused by a drunken ship captain. These jobs should be forbidden to anyone without weekly sobriety tests whether they are drunks or not. It averts major disasters because you can be sure that airlines will never admit they let a drunk fly an aircraft that crashed and killed hundreds of people. Think financial liability. You might be surprised to learn that pilot error is airline code for drunk while flying. I have heard some harrowing stories in AA ranging from a guy that got released from prison after serving 20 years for a crime he didn't remember committing to a guy that wiped out an entire family of four in an accident in a blackout. He spent 25 years in prison. The sad truth is that many newcomers to AA tell themselves that it will never happen to them until it does. Drunks are very ingenious at hiding their misdeeds and lying to people who care about them. Family members who are enablers thrive on the control that a sick alcoholic relinquishes to them. The drunk willing gives up responsibility for their own lives and then blames others for their problems. It is a common problem and the family member is as sick as the alcoholic. That is why Alanon (the family members 12 step program) exists. Once an alcoholic manifests drunken behavior, the progression of the disease gets worse until the drinking phase ends. Court-ordered in many cases. True statistic, 85% of prison offenders have drugs or alcohol involved in their crime. AA is the easier softer way out of trouble because courts respect AA's track record of helping drunks get sober. Churches don't usually welcome alcoholics and the courts are not sentencing criminals to church for that reason. If a drunk lives the principles of AA, they find a Supreme Being of their own understanding that solves their problem. Step 2: Came to believe in a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. Many drunks are unable to admit they are insane. A good look at their behavior while drinking is proof enough for alkies who want to honestly stop drinking. Drunks don't like to be told what to do, but if they will listen to an alcoholic who has stopped drinking. They respect that and can't understand how a real drunk can stop drinking for good. It is the their only hope for a normal life, if they want a normal life. Shaming a drunk is like pouring gasoline on an open flame. They hate themselves for what they view as a weakness. Shame is what they get everytime they drink and act out. They are used to it and the shame actually helps them cope with their feelings of guilt. That is part of the negative reinforcement by the sick Alanon of bad behavior. The Alanon wants to believe them and the drunk gets relief from the guilt of their alcoholic actions because the shame feels like responsibility to them. They try to convince themselves it will be different next time. The media is not helping in that regard. The less they write about a specific alcoholic and the more they educate the public about AA, the more of a public service they perform. I hope that the editor of the Washington Post or someone at the Post is reading this blog. It is a moral responsibility for a story about a debilitating disease such as alcoholism to include at least one line about the solution, in this case it is AA. You can be part of the solution, not the problem. It is your choice. Posted by: AAKen PM Not sure if there's an AA problem here and think that the dissertation by the AA guy is warranted in this case. So many are speculating on the real situation with L.L. and it's good to hear that she is seeking help, although it's too bad she can't get help from her immediate family. Posted by: Paul PM Re these comments by AAKen: "Alcoholics need to be trainwrecks before they are willing to stop drinking. They must hit bottom.

This is one of the common conceptions which AA teaches about alcoholics, but as AA's Big Book shows, it's not necessarily always so. Many of the stories in Part II are by people who specifically did not "hit bottom", but were able to stop. I'm just pointing this out in case there are readers who are alcoholics and are thinking of seeking help. It's never too soon! Posted by: Mark | May 30, 2007 01:24 AM Liz Kelly, who peddles celebrity news for lack of any journalistic integrity is telling a celeb whose antics keep her in a job to go away. This is the woman who has a "Stories by Category" section on celebs whose antics are reported minute by minute. Lindsay and her ilk needs to go away and Liz Kelly and her ilk need to go look at their journalism degrees and ask themselves the last news of note they reported! Posted by: Amy | May 30, 2007 05:03 AM Liz has an ilk? Posted by: byoolin | May 30, 2007 08:17 AM I'm amused by the naivete of the people who've posted things like "the media have made her famous." Somelikeitscott (great name!) had it right when he wrote, "Let's face it, Lohan and Paris are what we've made them." The 9 movies released to date in the US in which Lindsay has appeared have sold just under $420,000,000 worth of tickets. If the media were making her famous there wouldn't be enough reporters left outside the theatres to publish a PennySaver. Posted by: byoolin | May 30, 2007 09:07 AM Mark is right. Not every Alcoholic hits rock bottom, but they do hit their own personal bottom. I did srite, "How far down they fall is their own choice once they have been introduced to AA." So, while life-changing events that limit certain people from ever rejoining society do happen. Some bottoms are not as extreme as others. Judge for yourself what your real situation is and know that alcoholism is a progressive disease, unfortunately. It gets worse, never better. Which means that even after 17 years without a drink, I would not start where I left off when I stopped. My disease progessed all those 17 years and it would be as though I never stopped at all once I took that first drink. I am a real alcoholic. I can never safely drink again, living the AA recovery one day at a time. AA rocks!! Posted by: AAKen | May 30, 2007 01:30 PM I'm personally sick and tired of these girls. They have no concept of what life is all about and can't wait until their next drug or drink because they can't handle the fame. Boo-Hoo.

Posted by: patti Escabi | May 30, 2007 01:36 PM Why is it never mentioned that she is underage to drink. How does she get served at apparently every bar in Los Angeles. I know, I know, she is a celebrity. Do the police turn the other way when an underage celebrity is served in every bar in town. Shouldn't she lose her drivers license for like 10 years for a DUI when you are underage? How come this is never mentioned? Posted by: Jim72344 | May 30, 2007 01:57 PM Arrest the bartender who served her. Posted by: Jeremiah | May 30, 2007 02:14 PM I have the same question as Jim72344. Why aren't the establishments that are illegally serving her being called on it? I'm sure that's going to be one of her excuses. Her talent in Parent Trap has faded. The media has nothing to do w/her bank account, she doesn't get paid everytime her name appears in print. The only way to get rid of her is not go see her movies or buy her pathetic albums. Posted by: Sharon | May 30, 2007 02:20 PM I got about halfway though the feedback when I thought that more people seem to care about LL than real news. Maybe we should do something about that. And I'm not blaming the media. Posted by: m | May 30, 2007 02:25 PM I heart Liz. She has no ilk. Posted by: erm | May 30, 2007 03:50 PM I actually am impressed by LL's ability to outsmart the legal system. By leaving the scene, she is easily able to deny she was driving under the influence, deny that she was driving at all, and deny that any drugs found belong to her or any member of her posse. Leaving the accident site was brilliant. Posted by: Reedman | May 30, 2007 04:01 PM This un-douched looking, sad, sloppy drunk drug addict is getting on my nerves, occupying precious editorial space with no constructive image to project for young, decent girls today.

Posted by: Nick McCord | May 30, 2007 04:16 PM Since so many of these little starlets are jail-bound, who will fill their tiny stilletos next? Where are the 16- and 17-year-olds who will next hop onto the party wagon? That's the way Hollywood has always rolled - only back in the day, this stuff was covered up and there were fewer "star watch" reports. It's where youth is glorified and indulged - everyone's a kid, everyone's cool, and parents - man, what are they doing here?! Rules are for suckers! Partying rocks! Always has, whenever you get so many pretty people, so much money, and so little judgment (the "easy road" of acting calls to thousands every year) all together in one place. They usually leave all their anchors far away - family, day jobs, self-respect - and they drift without support networks in L.A. And there's no "there" there. Either that, or they were just dense to begin with, and can't say no. Posted by: Maritza | May 31, 2007 10:59 AM But she won't go away as long as we keep talking about her!

Fox's unscripted Hollywood competish "On the Lot" bowed in its regular timeslot Monday night to a fifth-place finish among the broadcasters. After failing to ignite much interest with a pair of preview episodes last week -- including one following the final "American Idol" performance show of the season -- the search for the next great film director settled for fewer than 3 million viewers. Of course, Memorial Day isn't a great night to kick off a series, and Fox can hope that its audience grows from here. But the net could be forced to yell "Cut!" if numbers remain at this level -- which are low even by summer standards. Based on preliminary same-day Nielsen nationals for Monday, "On the Lot" averaged a 1.3 rating/4 share in adults 18-49 and 2.9 million viewers overall from 8 to 10 p.m., peaking with about 3.1 million from 8:30 to 9. Those numbers left the net behind repeats on CBS as well as firstrun programming on ABC, NBC and Univision; Fox also may have trailed a cabler or two in the 9 o'clock hour. Show's regular airing pattern is an hour on Monday, followed by a "box office" results show Tuesday. Elsewhere Monday, ABC's new limited-run series "Ex-Wives Club" (prelim 2.0/5 in 18-49, 5.3 million viewers overall) placed third at 9 o'clock, airing behind a slot-leading original episode of "Wife Swap" (prelim 2.3/7, 6.3 million). This repped a slight improvement over last year's "How to Get the Guy," which bowed on a Monday in June. NBC's coverage of "The Miss Universe Pageant" settled for a prelim 2.4/7 in 18-49, and 7.1 million viewers overall from 9 to 11 p.m. -- down 25% from last year's July airing and believed to be the pageant's lowest numbers in at least 20 years. It didn't get much help from its lackluster lead-in -- an original episode of reality series "The Real Wedding Crashers" (prelim 1.5/5 in 18-49, 4.1 million). With firstrun fare struggling on other nets, CBS cleaned up by claiming the top three programs of the night with repeats of "Two and a Half Men" (prelim 3.4/9 in 18-49, 10.7 million), "The King of Queens" (3.0/8, 8.8 million) and "CSI: Miami" (2.9/8, 9.4 million). Due to the Monday holiday, the primetime ratings report and charts for the week of May 21-27 will appear in Thursday's edition.

TMZ spotted mega-lawyer Blair Berk driving Lohan to the facility on Monday. Sources tell TMZ this is "a serious medical treatment program," not the in-and-out ruse used by other starlets in the recent past. We're told Lohan will be a resident at the facility, possibly for 30 days, but her outpatient treatment will last much longer. It would seem Lohan's next movie project may be , at least temporarily. We were told shooting was expected to start the day after tomorrow, but that almost certainly will not happen. A rep for Lindsay Lohan issued TMZ the following statement: "Lindsay admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility on Memorial Day. Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation and respect the privacy of Lindsay as well as the other patients receiving treatment at the facility." Rosie &ndash; I Was "Foster Kid" on "View" Rosie O'Donnell -- always wanting to get the last word in -- says that she probably won't speak to "View" combatant Elisabeth Hasselbeck again after their on-air slugfest, and that being on "The View" for the past year made her feel like "a foster kid." "I haven't spoken to her, and I think it's just as well" said Rosie on her video blog at . "I wrote her an e-mail, and she wrote me back, and there you have it." What's more, said O'Donnell, she compared her stint on "The View" to being "just like a foster kid for a year ... I didn't really fit into the family and now it's time for the foster kid to go back home." Rosie also confessed that the moustache left on the photo of Elisabeth was the work of her chief writer, Janette Barber, calling it "a joke on the way out." Mini Brit and Mini K-Fed Square Off Mini Britney has her very own pint-sized PopoZao -- a little person version of K-Fed. in Las Vegas this weekend where Terra Jole, aka Mini Britney Spears, rocked out to two of Ms. Spears' biggest hits, "Toxic" and "Oops ... I Did it Again," in her Brit-inspired flight attendant and red latex uniforms. It truly Mid-performance, a gold-chain, wifebeater-wearing, thugged-out Fed-alike (played by Wee Matt) took over the stage, and just like the couple's colossal counterparts, they argued! Mini Brit even offered some tender parting words to the lil' guy -- "Get the f**k outta here!" Cam and Jess -- Bitchfight Brewing? Cameron Diaz and Jessica Biel -- the ex GF and current paramour of Justin Timberlake -- will both be presenting at the upcoming MTV Movie Awards, reports , and handlers are doing everything "to keep Cam and Jess far apart," admitting that the situation is creating "a mess." You'll remember that Diaz got all up in JT's face when she saw him flirting with Biel at a Hollywood party back in January. But now that Timberlake is very publicly bringing sexy back with Biel, the triangle of stars will have to be very carefully managed. Says the source, "Cameron's looking a little unstable lately."

I think Lindsay is wasting her talent on drugs like most "teens" starlets do. It shouldn't be like, "Oh what a druggie!" These news should shock us...drugs are trully affecting every aspect of our lives. As for bluengold: I am proud of you! I totally agree with you. My sister ended up in our couch, hallucinating wildly, vomitting, and looking like she was about to die! I was there....I had to babysitt her and take care of her at home rehab. on May 29th 2007 by Corina 7.

I would point fingers and call names like the next person, but there's a bigger issue here. You'd think people like Ms. Lohan, and Ms. Spears, and everyone else who landed in rehab lately could spare themselves all this embarrassment if they simply learned from other people's mistakes. We've seen celebrities wreck their own careers--and sometimes lives--because someone didn't educate them about the pitfalls of fame. After all this time, SOMEONE must have amassed loads of information about those pitfalls; why no one made that information public is beyond me. As a hopeful bestselling author, I would like to use my eventual celebrity status to raise awareness of these problems. I see no reason for people, like Ms. Lohan, to put themselves through the wringer when they can easily avoid it. This way, they can still do what they love without harming themselves in the process. Oh--and the papers can go back to reporting on more relevant things, like the war in Iraq, the shambles of this latest presidential campaign, etc., etc. on May 29th 2007 by Please keep your comments relevant to this blog entry.

Monika Rawal and Radhika Das With the frenzy of the Miss Universe 2007 pageant over and Miss Japan Riyo Mori finally taking home the coveted title, the question foremost in everyoneâs minds is: when will India bring home the crown? When Indian contender Puja Gupta reached the Top 10, an entire nation couldnât help but be hopeful that maybe this time it would relive the glory. And rightly so. After Lara Dutta won the Miss Universe crown in 2000, none of her successors have been able to make a mark at the international beauty pageants. Miss India 2006 Neha Kapur did not make it to the Top 10 and even before that Celina Jaitley, Neha Dhupia, Nikita Anand, Tanushree Dutta and Amrita Thapar, did not live up to expectations. While the contestants and trainers feel that reaching the Top 10 is no small feat, why is the crown eluding Indiaâs beauties? Are there flaws in the selection process or has the contest become tougher? Has the selection committee become lenient in selecting or are Indian beauties losing their charm? According to Sabira Merchant, speech and diction trainer, the competition has become really tough but an important reason she feels is the lack of âthe right kind of girls who are prepared to compete at such a big platform. âNot many beautiful girls are coming forward for the Miss India pageants because they fear rejection. They have everything in them but they are not ready to give it a try and this is where we need to get strong. India needs the hidden talent to come out and try their luck without the fear of being rejected,â she adds. Sabira also feels that another reason could be the fact that Indian girls are pre-occupied with many other things and that is why they do not come forward to participate in beauty contests. âWith more and more avenues opening up for the glamour industry, girls enter directly into modeling and go abroad for shows and so on, so they are not coming in large numbers,â she asserts. Referring to Laraâs win in 2000, fashion designer Hemant Trivedi adds - on a slightly different note though, âI believe that one cannot keep doing great again and again and there can be reasons like a physical and intellectual difference that decides the winner. Most importantly, the contestants coming in for this pageant need to be more serious and from our end, we need to give them a better helping hand through training.â (Pic courtesy:/Miss Universe L.P., LLLP) Why is the crown eluding Indian beauties?

RELATED STORIES & LINKS Kevin Costner Takes On A Killer Role In Addition To Playing A Murderer, The Actor-Director-Golfer Adds Another Hyphenate: Musician Kevin Costner's Wife Has A Boy Actor's Wife Gave Birth To Cayden Wyatt Costner On Sunday Night Costner Is 'The Old Guy' Now! Plays Veteran Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer Teacher In 'The Guardian' The Case Of Kutcher Vs. Kutcher Ashton Kutcher Goes Up Against Himself This Weekend At The Box Office NEW YORK, May 30, 2007 WHAT DO YOU THINK? Kevin Costner has been making movies for 25 years and his roles have ranged from everything to an aging ballplayer in "Bull Durham," a medieval hero in "Robin Hood" and a renegade former Union solider in "Dances with Wolves." But the psychological thriller "Mr. Brooks" shows us a Costner we've never seen before. Costner stars as Earl Brooks, a successful business and family-man who is able to keep his murderous alter ego, played by William Hurt, at bay until a photographer played by Dane Cook sees him commit a crime. Photos: Kevin Costner Makes An Impression Much of the film's dialogue goes on in Earl's head. He and his alter ego argue about killing and confessing. "It's a movie that's a perfect storm of pressure," Costner told . "Has an (alter)-ego banging on him. He has Dane Cook, kind of a wanna-be, who is, in a way, more insidious." Serial killer movies are not the usual kind of films Costner makes and he said he won't even go see them. He chose "Mr. Brooks," which also stars Demi Moore as a detective working the case, because he said it has "some interesting entertainment value." "This one had this weird thing where you found yourself, I think, laughing appropriately," he said. "And yet you understood why you were laughing. And I think you end up with a lot of empathy. And so, for me, this movie's not any different than 'Field of Dreams' in a way. It's just, hopefully, an American classic." Costner said the story was presented to him in three parts  setting the stage for a sequel, something he has never done before. He wanted to know what the premise of the second movie would be even before the first one was made to make sure a series would work. But in the first movie his character never meets Moore, so the stage is set for a dramatic encounter somewhere down the line. While Costner, 52, has been working harder than ever on his career, his personal life is also progressing. He and his wife of three years, Christine, just gave birth to a son, Caden Wyatt, two weeks ago. He is named after Costner's movie "Wyatt Erp." "It's sweet. He's sweet," Costner said. "I told a story today to somebody that I woke up this morning  or yesterday when we flew into New York  woke up, was with him, looking at him, and he's so needy and so close. And then I got on the plane and I brought my two daughters who are 23 and 20 and they're so needy  and they both fell asleep in my lap, too. So it was like I had Caden, who is 2 weeks old, and then the five hours coming out here, there was Annie and Lilly  both took their turns." Costner said Christine, who is much younger than him, made it clear she wanted to have a family. Being a father a second time around isn't much different, Costner said, because even when he was building his career, he said he made time for his three older kids. "I went to all their games and I made that work around the movies and they were with me," he said. "I don't have to look back and go, 'Gee, doggone it.' So if anything, I thought I need to be as good to Caden as I feel like I was to those three. I have friends who said, 'The second time, I am really enjoying it.' I'm just really quiet in those conversations." © MMVII, CBS Interactive, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Now you're in the public comment zone.

News - Paula Abdul Says No to Drugs, Alcohol - Paula Abdul Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Paula Abdul Says No to Drugs, Alcohol Wed, 30 May 2007 04:12:49 PM PDT doth protest too much, we thinks. judge has denied yet again that her often bizarre behavior on the Fox show stems from drug or alcohol use. "I&#39;m sick of it. I&#39;ve never been drunk. I don&#39;t do recreational drugs. It&#39;s defamation of character," Abdul told magazine in its latest issue. Abdul, 44, has said in the past that she suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a rare neurological disorder that causes chronic pain. She claims the condition often keeps her up at night, leaving her exhausted and therefore more prone to making nonsensical statements. "If I appear exhausted on television, it&#39;s because I am! I have a lot of sleepless nights because I&#39;m in so much pain," she said. "I try to say something and I stumble, and that&#39;s what people have picked up on. I&#39;m not polished." Abdul&#39;s chronic pain began with a cheerleading accident when she was 17, and was exacerbated by a car accident caused by a drunk driver in 1987 and a plane crash in 1992. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I&#39;ve had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first-season finale of She said she manages the pain with anti-inflammatory medications, massage therapy and acupuncture. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul first revealed that she suffered from the condition in 2005 while responding to rampant speculation from posters on the message boards about her erratic behavior on the show. "It was time to set the record straight. I want America to know that I have never been addicted to anything, no chemical dependency, nothing for recreational purposes," she told In January, she again spoke up in her own defense after raising eyebrows by conducting a series of television interviews in which she slurred her words and appeared generally confused. She blamed the incident on a combination of factors, including an audio glitch and lack of sleep, but firmly denied that alcohol or drugs had anything to do with it. "Fatigue and exhaustion just added to the whole thing looking so disoriented. But no alcohol and no drugs, absolutely no!" Abdul told Robin Leach&#39;s Vegas-based blog, Luxe Life, at the time. "I just can&#39;t explain it, but for me, no excuses and no apologies." Despite the occasionally unwanted attention her judgeship has brought upon her, Abdul said that appearing on the show has been the most rewarding experience of her life. "Being a judge on overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she said. As for being the "nice one," in contrast to her fellow panelists , the former Laker Girl said it comes naturally. "My purpose is bringing out everybody&#39;s best and being that cheerleader to other people&#39;s success," she said.

I too suffer from a chronic pain condition, but if she really wants to silence the critics, she should voluntarily submit herself for blood and hair testing. That will totally make EVERYONE of the people that say she's high shut up!! amgray1 on 05/31/2007 8:00AM oldadeyo - you are so... oldadeyo - you are so right! For those people who say that she is a drug addict and a drunk, you have no credibility. You don't personally know her and don't know what her day to day activities are. Paula Abdul should not have to endure her pain AND have to deal with people calling her a drunk. She does not have to justify herself to anyone but she opted to set the record straight. Hope everything goes well for her. evanettie on 05/31/2007 7:53AM You GO GIRL. Paula R... You GO GIRL. Paula Rocks. We love you on Idol. All 3 of the panelist together as a team make Idol what it is.

I've often wondered if she suffers from a medical condition. Possibly something even more debilitating in the long term than the pain issue she describes? IF she did have a drug / alcohol abuse problem, you'd think someone would have come up with the proof by now. Michael J Fox didn't go public as soon as he was diagnosed.

It's Seth Rogen's turn to be the star. After his supporting role in , Steve Carell got the lead in Judd Apatow's . Now for his follow-up, sidekick Rogen gets the lead. He plays a stoner trying to start a celebrity nudity website (unbeknownst of Mrskin.com) who hooks up with the beautiful Katherine Heigl one night. Thanks to a condom mishap, she gets pregnant and now the broke loser has to step up. Even fake movie sex scenes with Katherine Heigl must have been awesome. Were they as great to shoot as it looked? Yeah, it&rsquo;s really kind of nerve wracking, you know. If I was 18 years old, I&rsquo;d literally be as far as I&rsquo;ve ever been with a girl. Essentially you&rsquo;re dry humping. I don&rsquo;t know if you can say that, but I&rsquo;ll say it. You&rsquo;re dry humping a girl who you don&rsquo;t know very well and I was just afraid I was going to sweat on her. That was my major concern, that I was going to drip a big gob of sweat on her head. It&rsquo;s nerves, but luckily they&rsquo;re comedic sex scenes, supposedly. So that kind of helps. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m supposed to be acting sexy. There&rsquo;s lines like, "This is my new record" in there so that kind of alleviates some of the pressure that would be put on me to look attractive and sexy, which is nice. or any other sex comedy an influence on you when you were a kid? Porky&rsquo;s, you mean the highest grossing Canadian film of all time! Yes, that was. Porky&rsquo;s was one of those films. When they played it in Canada, I would tape bits of it, the nude scenes and compile them. So I&rsquo;ve seen the nine minutes of Porky&rsquo;s where people are naked 1000 times over and over. The rest I&rsquo;ve recently caught up on, but that introduced me to adulthood, Porky&rsquo;s. What about other sex comedies? was a movie I always liked. It&rsquo;s pretty dirty for a Tom Hanks movie. There&rsquo;s some bestiality jokes in there and stuff like that, that would always shock me. Kevin Smith was an inspiration language wise, I would say. His movies were the first that I saw that people were cursing up a storm and that was very amusing to me, so I think we took a nod from that, definitely when it comes to sexual language anyway. Are you ready to be the lead in another romantic comedy? We&rsquo;ll see. I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a strange concept, I guess, that romance is what people want to see me do but I had fun, I&rsquo;d keep doing it, sure! Were you familiar with the site Mr. Skin before making this movie? No&hellip;(long pause). Yes, of course I was. Originally in the movie, there was no Mr. Skin. I can&rsquo;t remember how it actually played out, but the movie originally took place in a universe that Mr. Skin did not exist, and it really started to amuse us, the notion that Mr. Skin did exist and we just hadn&rsquo;t heard of it. It just made us laugh a lot as we were writing, so that&rsquo;s where that kind of came from. Yeah, definitely, the idea for our webpage came from Mr. Skin. Was there as much improv here as in 40-Year-Old Virgin? Yes, there was tons of improv in all the scenes, especially the ones with me and my friends. We hired my actual friends because we always hope for those dynamics to kind of show on film. Our hope was to be able to tell we were all friends and we actually all know each other really well and the best way to get that stuff out is just through improv'ing and letting loose. The actual dynamics play out of it. Generally, we shoot the script once or twice and then we just kind of go off. Harold Ramis put it well, he was talking about it, and he said when he did and stuff, he would always say, "The script is the worst case scenario. The script is what we have if we can&rsquo;t think of anything better." That&rsquo;s pretty much what we do, and it was a pretty good script to begin with, so it was a pretty good worse case scenario we all thought. But, we basically said whatever came up. The whole Munich thing, that wasn&rsquo;t even implied in the script at all. That stuff just comes up as you&rsquo;re shooting. You're a new star to a lot of people, so what was your background? As far as my past goes, I started doing stand-up in Vancouver around when I was thirteen and then I got cast for , by Judd, when I was 16 and I moved to LA, and sunk my claws into him and haven&rsquo;t let go ever since. How outrageous and R-rated were you at age 13 when you were doing stand up in Vancouver? I was not. I was clean. I didn&rsquo;t work blue back then. Mostly because my mother came to a lot of my shows I think. I was just embarrassed. My life wasn&rsquo;t that R-rated back then, I guess. I tried to be truthful to what was going on with my life and my friends and my experiences. Then, it was more about my grandparents and playing video games and my Bar Mitzvah and stuff like that. I hadn&rsquo;t delved into the filthy world I now occupy. Where was it where you first did your stand up? At a lesbian bar in Vancouver called The Lotus. I thought it was Ladies Night. I didn&rsquo;t really get what was happening. How did a 13-year-old get hooked up in a lesbian bar? You sign up. The first time, there&rsquo;s actually a workshop that was being held at the bar where you go and basically learn. They tell you the loose format for writing a stand-up joke, and then at the end, you go and perform it for everyone. Then, from there, you just start getting invited out, someone there would say, "I know this other guy who runs this other comedy room," and "why don&rsquo;t you come and do 5 minutes." After that, you kind of get invited to do ten minutes and then you&rsquo;re kind of making 50 bucks a week and you don&rsquo;t need to work at McDonalds. How often are you writing? Pretty much when I&rsquo;m not acting, which is often, I guess. Or doing press. Yeah, as soon as I finish doing the Knocked Up promotion, I will start writing again. And between movies, that&rsquo;s kind of my default mode is sitting in my underwear writing. That&rsquo;s where I want to be, if no one else expects me to be anywhere else. Which creative hat do you enjoy the most? I&rsquo;ve got to say, with movies like Knocked Up, where I have significant amount of input and , which we just did, I really love doing them both. It&rsquo;s hard to pick one. Ideally, I&rsquo;d just keep doing this and be able to wear both hats at once. I view them, they&rsquo;re kind of the same thing to me. They&rsquo;re both kind of making movies, it&rsquo;s not really compartmentalized in two separate halves of my brain, really. It&rsquo;s all part of the same goal and I like to be as involved as I can. How raunchy is Superbad? It's all involving teens, according to the MPAA. That was the big thing. Our prime directive with Superbad was to bring back, unaware of where we were bringing it back from, movies like Fast Times. That stuff we really like and has a really relatable feel to it, and the language feels true to life. We hadn&rsquo;t really seen that when we started writing Superbad. We were 14 years old when we started writing it. It was born out of a very pure desire to see kids acting as how we acted on film, and speak how we speak and spoke. It just happened to be very dirty. And it&rsquo;s also just what made us laugh. When me and my writing partner, Evan Goldberg were writing it, we were teenagers in Vancouver. There was no real implication that it would ever get made into something. It was just to amuse ourselves. And unfortunately, really, really filthy jokes is what amuses us, so that&rsquo;s what we wrote. But, yeah, it was just born out of a desire to see teen characters act like what we acted like when we were in high school. What do you play in As far as Fanboys, I haven&rsquo;t seen the final movie. I play several kind of characters throughout it. My good friend, Jay Baruchel is in it, who is here today.Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know ultimately what my roles in that are. I hope they&rsquo;re funny. It seemed funny when we did it. What&rsquo;s it like to have the Freaks and Geeks gang back together? It&rsquo;s amazing. I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s funny, I look back to Freaks and Geeks and I&rsquo;m terrified how little thought I put into it. I think I was just young and inexperienced and it never really dawned on me that at this time, this was a really great show we were doing and these actors were amazing. It really just seemed so there and given. Looking back, it&rsquo;s a great show with some really talented people involved, and we all got along really well, so I think that&rsquo;s why we all want to keep working together. I just finished a movie with James Franco a few days ago, and it was amazing to be able to work together again. We kept looking at each other saying, "If you told us 8 years ago that someone would allow us to be in a movie that we&rsquo;re the stars of, I would have never believed it." It&rsquo;s amazing to us. How dirty is the humor in Sexually speaking, Pineapple Express is not nearly as dirty as Superbad or maybe even Knocked Up. It&rsquo;s not really a sexual movie. It&rsquo;s more of a marijuana themed, buddy/buddy, comedy, more in the tone of say, How action packed is it? I mean, action wise, it&rsquo;s pretty jammed packed. We&rsquo;ve got car chases and shoot-outs and explosions and me holding many machine guns, which is amusing to me. I hope other people find it entertaining, but when you say you&rsquo;re making an action comedy, it&rsquo;s like anything else. We thought it really has to function as really both as an action and as a comedy; with a romantic comedy, it needs to function in those worlds as well. We took that very seriously.

Christie's set a world record last year when Audrey Hepburn's iconic black dress sold for $932,178. Today, Christies's puts another dress from "Breakfast at Tiffany's" on the auction block: the hot pink cocktail dress worn by actress Audrey Hepburn when she learns that her brother Fred has been killed. Hepburn, portraying bohemian Holly Golightly, breaks down in a fit during the scene, throwing dishes and smashing pillows. The dress, silk with small rhinestones, is estimated to fetch $20,000 to $30,000 today at the auction and was on display during a preview of Film and Entertainment Memorabilia at Christie's auction house in New York, left.

BROOKS Interview: KEVIN COSTER TAPS HIS DARK SIDE FOR 'MR. BROOKS' Actor hates horror films, and loves working with William Hurt Kevin Costner abandons the films that he is known for and tackles a much darker role in the psychological thriller . Costner plays a man who is prone to giving himself over to his darker, homicidal side and as a result is being pursued by the authorities. iF MAGAZINE chatted with Costner about what drew him to this project, his loathing of scary movies, and working with his dark side William Hurt. iF MAGAZINE: What made you want to take on this kind of dark role we haven't really seen you in before? The decision was pretty simple. The movie, I thought, was the star. I thought the writing was the star of the movie, and I thought that while I didn't see myself like that person, I thought I could do this, you know? And so when I make up my mind, first and foremost, is it a movie...Because even though you have to professionally cover movies, I&rsquo;m sure that deep down you do love movies, and probably love movies when they surprise you. And I think that this movie kind of, on paper, I thought it had all those moments. If we embraced them and went for them, I understood that it would be seen as a departure. [Laughs] I understood all the things that would come with it, but I still felt like, if I&rsquo;m going to make a life of making movies, then I should try to make different kind of movies. And this seemed to fit in a positive way. iF: Did you consider directing this? I thought about that, but when I realized what the pedigree of the project was, that the writers who wrote it wanted to direct it, then we had a discussion about that. I could have done that, but in this instance, this was important for him to direct. And I've worked with a lot of first-time directors, writer/directors, and I thought, "I'll give this a chance." iF: Did you decide right away that you wanted to produce it as well? I knew that without a doubt that I would have to do that. I knew that I would also have to have final cut on it. If you like the movie, the odd things about it I knew would be things that would be cut first. If you don't like blood, blood would be gone. If you don't like this, that would be gone. Because they ask audiences, "What do you like?" "I don&rsquo;t like this." But I thought that this piece was dark. It&rsquo;s insidious, what it is. Even though we ashamedly find ourselves laughing at some moments, the oddity of it, I felt that it needed to be true to itself, and I didn't want to see it...If no one else wanted to make this movie and I wanted to make it, why would I let anybody try to flatten it out and make it more generic? So while I know maybe some longtime people who&rsquo;ve enjoyed my movies might be offended by this, might think that it&rsquo;s too harsh, I get that, and I accept that. But I don't want to cater to my audience, I just want to feed it, you know? Take or not take it. It&rsquo;s an honest effort.

And were you familiar with his stand-up? I wasn't familiar with his stand-up. And I'm actually glad, because I don't completely understand his stand-up all the time. But I understand him, and I understand his desire to not be pigeonholed, be conformed. And he read for me. He read for this movie. He did all the things that someone who has a bigger idea about their career does. They want something that they see themselves being a part of something unique, and he did, and that's why he got the part. And he was sensational in it. iF: Do you see a little of Mr. Brooks in yourself? Well, the things that we all see in ourselves in Mr. Brooks are that we would all go defend our daughter. Mad as hell, but we would go kill for them. And so there are things that...Mr. Brooks isn't looking for forgiveness. "Oh, don't you see that I'm really a nice guy?" No, he&rsquo;s not. He has a disease. When that disease isn't working, he is a nice guy. But the families that he's dismantled&hellip;that kind of thing that families are destroyed forever--mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters...We don't really deal with that. We have to know in our hearts that that's what is...That's why we can't ever forgive him. But what Brooks is successful at, I think, is that it creates a certain kind of empathy. And empathy always comes in our life when we have a level of understanding. You may not like the serial killer, can never forgive him. He destroyed your girlfriend's life forever, blah blah blah, "I hate him, I wish he never was born,&rdquo; You might know him and know that he was assaulted and abused since he was 3 years old. And you can't forgive him either, and you can't say anything to her, but in your heart, you go, "That poor f**ker never had a chance." You have empathy because you have a level of understanding of him. And so in movies, we can create a level of understanding if we choose to invest in a character. And that's what made Mr. Brooks stand out to me as a serial killer movie. Because I don&rsquo;t like serial killer movies. I don't like scary movies. I get scared. I'm uncomfortable. I don't like roller coasters or sh** like that. I don't like being scared. It's not an adrenaline rush for me. So Mr. Brooks really had to pass a lot of things for me to want to even be a part of it. And it did. iF: Were you concerned that Marshall might overwhelm this movie? Well, I knew it was a really flashy role. And I very often take movies that have scene-stealing roles all around me, and I relish that. I think that's important for movies. I don't get scared by that stuff. I encourage the actors to be really good around me. I want that to happen. And I want them to do it inside the lines of the movie. And so when I see a great role, I want to go for a great actor. A great actor recognizes a great role. It just raises the whole level of the movie. I want to go to that for a second. It is a pleasing role. And you know, sometime the temptation is, in American movies now, conventional wisdom is they'll ask you, "What scene did you hate the most?" And you'll tell them. "What scene did you like the most?" In modern day filmmaking, that scene you hated the most goes flying out of the movie. But that doesn't mean it should have. It gives the movie a balance. And they might ask you about characters, and you say, "Well, I really like Marshall the most." Then an executive goes, "Let's write some more scenes for Marshall." I think Marshall was in there just perfectly. Just perfectly. iF: How was it playing those scenes opposite William Hurt? It was fun. I mean, I've known William because of , and we both are rehearsal-oriented actors, and writer-driven actors. So it fit into our game really nicely. iF: Was Marshall based on somebody? Yes. Marshall was based on a...I found Marshall when I was 12 years old in a book of children's dreams. And he would play basically a Black Knight, an evil person. But I liked him so much in the book because he was kind of cool. And I liked him so much; actually, I was afraid he was going to die in the book, so I never finished it. And my father used to discipline me with the idea that if I wasn't good, that the Black Knight would come and get me. That it would come and get me that it actually hid in my closet. And like any young man, eventually you challenge your dad's theory and you open that closet. And there was my imaginary friend, and he was not scary at all to me. And so he's been with me. Sort of my alter ego. And that began when I was 12 years old Bruce had only directed one film prior to Mr. Brooks. iF: What did he do to convince you that visually he could accomplish this? Well, I didn't look at his other movie. [Laughs] I didn't want to. Because once I committed to him as a director, I wanted to try to support him, and I didn't want to get panicked. I mean, I had heard different things. I didn't want to jade that. Once I gave him my word that he would get a chance to direct it, I wanted to back that up. But I wanted also to protect the movie by keeping final cut. Your Comments are always welcomed here Tell us what you think? Log In to leave your comments! You must be logged in to enter comments.

Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News dancing with the stars Wed, 30 May 2007 03:48:19 PM PDT That was no blockbuster opening for The reality show about aspiring filmmakers got squashed like going up against the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie, averaging just 6.4 million viewers in its first two broadcasts. In the case of Dancing with the Stars . In a head-to-head matchup last week, ABC&#39;s ballroom competition bested Fox&#39;s screening-room competition, 23 million viewers (third place) to 7.6 million (28th place), per the latest weekly Nielsen Media Research rankings released Wednesday. And while it&#39;s one thing to lose out to a hot property like &mdash;on its Apolo Anton Ohno-celebrating night, no less&mdash;it&#39;s another thing to lose out while airing after -Mark Burnett pedigree, both moguls are executive producers on the show, was picked to premiere following &#39;s penultimate episode. In the 8 p.m. Tuesday time slot, the Blake Lewis-Jordin Sparks sing-off averaged 25.3 million (second place). Then came along at 9 p.m., and there went Fox&#39;s audience&mdash;the show went on to lose 70 percent of its &#39;s results were worse: 5.2 million viewers (51st place). On the upside, Thursday&#39;s merely lost 45 percent of its lead-in, the season premiere of summer&#39;s typically sturdy So You Think You Can Dance (20th place, 9.5 million). was announced with much press-release fanfare in April 2006. The hook was not so much the concept&mdash;although its premiere was novel in that it eschewed the usual -celebrated funny/bad auditions&mdash;but the names: Spielberg, the Oscar-winning legend, and Burnett, the guru. Neither, however, was on hand for the opener, outside of their names in the end credits. and Garry Marshall supplied the recognizable faces&mdash;all were judges, none was a brutal . (Since last week&#39;s debut, there&#39;s been one switch: original host Chelsea Handler was swapped out for Adrianna Costa.) Set to air through the summer, says it&#39;ll give its winner a $1 million deal with DreamWorks. Maybe after, he or she can come up with a hit reality show. Elsewhere, in ratings highlights for the TV week ended Sunday: This is its now: &#39;s Sparks-flying finale (30.7 million viewers, first place) averaged nearly 6 million viewers less than last season&#39;s Taylor Hicks-coronation, and nearly 7 million viewers less than this season&#39;s inaugural episode. (sixth place, 13.9 million), NBC&#39;s (eighth place, 13.5 million), and ABC&#39;s (10th place, 12.7 million) all made it back into the top 10. Now, if they can arrange it so they always air really important episodes (i.e., finales) in a week where about half the series have begun their rerun vacations, they can take up permanent residence there. might want to reset its coordinates. In January, its season premiere averaged 15.8 million; last week, its season finale averaged 10.3 million (15th place). (42nd place, 5.5 million) isn&#39;t a hit, but it sure does make Grandma happy. Jesse Stone: Sea Change (ninth place, 13 million) was, in fact, a hit. Bingo&#39;s fun and all, but Grandma really loves her some Did you know NBC has started burning off its supply of unused s? Judging by the ratings in its Thursday-night premiere (76th place, 3.9 million), probably not. (78th place, 3.5 million) is still a lousy rerun, but at least now it has company from (86th place, 3.1 million). helped make ABC the highest-rated network among young women, aged 18-49, at least for the week of May 14, aka Rosie O&#39;Donnell&#39;s last full week of work. Overall, the smaller than usual finale was more than big enough to lift Fox to weekly wins as both the most watched network (11.6 million) and the highest rated network among young adults. The first half of the week constituted the final days of the 2006-07 season; the second half of the week constituted the first days of prime-time&#39;s summer. CBS finished second in viewers (9 million), while ABC took second in the demo, thanks to , though, could take ABC higher than third place in viewers; the network averaged 8.7 million.)

It can net you a movie deal -- and some very harsh public criticism. Eleven-year-old Jamison Stone of Alabama became the darling of a slow news cycle when over the Memorial Day weekend news agencies across the country published a photo of the apple-cheeked boy grinning over the gigantic carcass of a 10-foot boar. Hog Wild! Feral Pigs Invade Texas Wild Pigs Menace U.S., Whet Appetites in Europe Another Natural Threat to Florida: Feral Hogs The publicity prompted his father, Mike Stone, to create a Web site that features photos of the boy and his trophy, dubbed Monster Pig. It's also earned Jamison a bit part in an upcoming film "The Legend of Hogzilla," based on the tale of a superpig gunned down in Georgia in 2004. With fame, however, comes criticism. The Stones have been accused of everything from doctoring photos to make the pig look bigger to unnecessarily torturing an animal. "We've gotten a lot of negative e-mail," Mike Stone told ABCNEWS.com. "People have said they want to see my boy killed in a hunting accident and gutted like a pig." In the negative comments section of their Web site, monsterpig.com, one angry visitor wrote: "Hurry up and enlist in the Army, I want to see you chased and shot at. And maybe beheaded on video for us to see. â¦ I will laugh while eating my veggie burger." Another anonymous e-mail reads: "If you ate that pig, I hope it was carrying some kind of disease. The world would be better off without people like you." According to the 2000 census, some 1.7 million children between the ages of 6 and 15 years old hunt in the United States. Nevertheless, the idea of an 11-year-old chasing a boar on a fenced-in hunting ground for three hours and shooting it nine times with a handgun has many asking questions about the ethics of letting children hunt. It also brings into sharp relief different attitudes about hunting in different parts of the country. PeTA, or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, gave Stone the Worst Dad in the Country Award "for not only teaching his son how to kill but also doing further harm by showing him how to make animals suffer." "We look to parents to teach their kids empathy and compassion," said Daphna Nachminovitch, a PeTa spokeswoman. "This animal was not killed humanely; it was tortured. We oppose killing of animals for entertainment." Criticism and Congratulations for Boy Who Slew 'Monster Pig' Read All 154 Comments and Post Your Own WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

Life must be tough when you&#39;re as successful as Justin Timberlake. All the goals you&#39;ve set yourself have been attained and even the ridiculous ones you just made up to pass the time - Enrage the woman from A Life Less Ordinary ? Check. Impress one of the world&#39;s most beautiful women with a date at Nando&#39;s ? Sadly, check - are being seen through with ridiculous ease. So what&#39;s left for Justin Timberlake now that he has everything he could ever wish for? Thankfully, Justin&#39;s brief infatuation with seems to have passed - leaving him to concentrate on what he does best. Well, OK, not . Most frequently. Anyway, we&#39;re talking about music. Justin Timberlake has always been keen to help out other artists, like the Black Eyed Peas, Nelly Furtardo, Timbaland and - just to shut everyone up for a second - . But now Justin Timberlake is turning his interest legitimate with Tennman Records, a new record label that Justin has set up with Interscope. There have been plenty of quotes about Tennman from all sorts of record executives, but they&#39;re all full of identical backslappy business-speak so we won&#39;t print them. Instead, here&#39;s what Justin Timberlake has to say on the matter: &ldquo;We are all excited about the talent we have to offer already on our roster, and I cannot wait to introduce the world to my new discoveries.&rdquo; Not that we can see how Justin Timberlake will be able to commit too much time to Tennman Records though - he&#39;s also apparently busy producing tracks for &#39;s next album, looking to star in more rubbish films that nobody watches and performing any number of attention-seeking that he can get his hands on. Best of luck to Justin Timberlake and Tennman Records, and we look forward to hearing the label&#39;s first release - a song called Justin&#39;s Bringing Sexy Back The Dynamite Justin Timberlake Majorette All-Star Squadron (Featuring Justin Timberlake) Timberlake Launching Own Record Label - Justin Timberlake Makes Some Wonderful Clothes Or Something Justin Timberlake &#038; Cameron Diaz Still Not Splitting Up Cameron Diaz &#038; Justin Timberlake Back Together, But Probably Not Justin Timberlake Not Just Back, He&#8217;s SexyBack Justin Timberlake Chavs Around To Impress Jessica Biel Cameron Diaz Ain&#8217;t Never Getting Married Justin Timberlake &#038; Cameron Diaz Give Each Other The Shaft Justin Timberlake Pleased About Gay Lance Bass This entry was posted on Wednesday, May 30th, 2007 3:30 pm and is filed under .

The deal is estimated to be worth $370 million in cash, according to sources familiar with the talks. Email to a friend Famous Music's catalog of more than 125,000 songs and sound cues includes music by Eminem and Shakira as well as movie soundtracks from "The Godfather" and "Mission Impossible." Famous was founded as a unit to publish songs from movies. The deal is the first major move by recently appointed Sony/ATV Chief Executive Martin Bandier, the former head of EMI Music Publishing, who left EMI earlier this year. As part of the deal, Sony/ATV will be entering the production music business through the Famous Extreme division. Sony/ATV is jointly owned by Sony Corp. and Jackson. Its catalog includes songs by The Beatles, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix, making it the fourth-largest music publisher. Bandier, who oversaw the growth of EMI Music Publishing from No. 4 publisher to the largest when he left, said he was appointed to expand the business through a mix of acquisitions and the addition of songwriters. "We're in the hunt for great artists and people to build the team," said Bandier in an interview with Reuters. "This deal announces that we're in the game. Our strategy is to become one of the more meaningful players in the publishing business," he added. Sony/ATV bought the Leiber Stoller songs catalog last month in a deal industry experts valued at around $50 million. The songs, by iconic songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, include "Hound Dog," "Jailhouse Rock," Stand By Me" and Love Potion #9." Music publishing has become one of the more coveted segments of the music industry as recorded music has been severely hit by piracy. It has been affected by the relatively slow transition of consumers to buying digital songs to make up for the downturn in sales of CDs. Publishing is less vulnerable to the vagaries of music retailing as it generates revenue by licensing songs to a variety of sources, including television, advertising, radio and live performances. Earlier this month, French media giant Vivendi SA's Universal Music Publishing Group unit became the world's largest music publisher after it bought BMG Music Publishing in a $2.19 billion deal. Other music companies have also said they intend to expand their publishing catalog, including Warner Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

"I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on `American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of `American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul _ who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s _ says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of `American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer." Fox is a unit of News Corp. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/5-3&fd=R&url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/30/entertainment/e111253D54.DTL&cid=1116623090&ei=muxeRqWaCpj2qgO93JjZDQ Judd Apatow: Comedian Behind the Camera Judd Apatow: Comedian Behind the Camera By JAKE COYLE, AP Entertainment Writer Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (05-30) 18:44 PDT New York (AP) -- At a recent Q&A following an advance screening of the riotous comedy "Superbad," a woman in the audience asked the film's producer Judd Apatow if he makes "romantic comedies for men." "That sounds like product &#8212; or a lube," replied the 39-year-old filmmaker. Apatow, the director of "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" and the new "Knocked Up," acknowledged such a label wasn't far off the mark, but said he doesn't think much about categorizing what he does. Besides, he said, "Isn't there love in every movie?" A classification like "romantic comedies for men" also doesn't do justice to other staples of Apatow's work &#8212; namely, an endless barrage of filthy jokes, cleverly delivered. And yet Apatow's comedy always maintains &#8212; as Seth Rogen, the star of "Knocked Up" and a frequent collaborator of Apatow's, says &#8212; an "oddly sweet" quality. Thanks to the huge success of 2005's "The 40 Year-Old Virgin," Apatow has broken through to the mainstream after a career that has spanned contributions to some of the most critically acclaimed comedies of the past 15 years &#8212; from "The Ben Stiller Show" to "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy." With the Friday release of the eagerly awaited "Knocked Up," it's clear he's become a behind-the-scenes ringleader to a thriving era of comedy that revels in mixing the dumb with the smart, the bawdy with the sincere. "I'm trying to figure out how to get gigantic laughs without losing my reality level," the wry, bearded Apatow explained over lunch at a recent interview in New York. "That's always the dance." Even as a teenager, Apatow was at the center of comedy. For his high-school radio show on Long Island in the mid-`80s, he managed to interview Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern, the original writers of "Saturday Night Live" and many others. "I really met EVERYBODY over the course of two years," Apatow recalls. "I would just ask them how they did it. It was an excuse to spend an hour asking: How do you write a joke?" Apatow later moved West to study screenwriting at USC, where he dropped out within two years thanks, in part, to a free trip won on "The Dating Game" &#8212; a comic twist in Apatow's biography worthy of one of his films. As a struggling standup, he lived with Adam Sandler and began writing jokes for other comedians, eventually writing for Roseanne Barr. His first and only attempt to work in front of the camera was quickly scuttled after a trip to an acting coach. "It was the worst acting anyone has ever done," says Apatow. "At that moment, the dream of comedian becoming actor died. I folded my cards immediately." Rejections by "Saturday Night Live" and "In Living Color" followed, but then he met Ben Stiller. Apatow executive-produced "The Ben Stiller Show" (1992), the short-lived but acclaimed Fox sketch show that spawned the careers of a myriad of comedians, including Stiller, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk and Andy Dick. "In a lot of ways, that's where everything started," says Apatow. "People connect the dots and see all the people I've worked with, but really, it all comes from Stiller." He then wrote for five years on HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show," eventually becoming an executive producer. The show's star, Garry Shandling remains a mentor. Like the dialogue of "Knocked Up," Apatow's speech is riddled with pop-culture references. He grew up obsessed with the Marx Brothers and Steve Martin, watched Woody Allen films endlessly, considers Harold Ramis' movies ("Caddyshack,""Groundhog Day") "a gigantic influence" and found inspiration in the mix of humor and realism in films like "Terms of Endearment" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." To Apatow, his greatest achievement is "Freaks and Geeks," the beloved cult favorite hour-long TV series that ran for only one season in 1999-2000. The show, created by Paul Feig and executive produced by Apatow, was followed by another acclaimed but canceled series: "Undeclared." "In a way, the movies are an extension of those TV shows," says Apatow. "Some people have been saying, `Do you feel like the reason these movies ("Virgin,""Knocked Up") are doing OK is because your work is getting better?' And I'm always like, `No, I don't think I'll ever make anything as good as "Freaks and Geeks."'" The lack of commercial success on the small screen led Apatow to concentrate on producing film projects, including a number of Will Ferrell films: "Anchorman,""Kicking and Screaming" and "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky and Bobby." "He obviously has this unique talent of someone who can make what would probably be classified as a broad comedy, but yet he's finding ways to deal with these real issues that we all face," says Ferrell. "He's tackling them in ways we haven't seen before." The box-office success of "Anchorman" helped Apatow get backing for "Virgin," his directorial debut, which he co-wrote with Steve Carell. "It gave me a career path," he says. "The beginning of my career was mainly about helping my friends execute their ideas, which was really fun but it wasn't based on my personal point of view." "Knocked Up," also written by Apatow, is very personal for him. Though the film &#8212; in which Rogen plays an immature pothead who has parenthood thrust upon him after a one-night stand with a far more professional woman (Katherine Heigl) &#8212; isn't directly autobiographical, the issues of facing adulthood are familiar to the director. Further, much of Apatow's life can be seen on screen. His wife, actress Leslie Mann, co-stars; their two young daughters play her character's children; Ramis symbolically plays a wise father to Rogen; and a good number of the actors from his past TV shows and movies have notable parts or make cameos. Mann, whom Apatow met while working on the Jim Carrey movie "The Cable Guy," says that while everything in "Knocked Up" has been reflected against a "funhouse mirror," much of it is culled from their relationship. For example, the scene where Allison (Heigl) boots Ben (Rogen) from the car while driving to the gynecologist was taken directly from an argument of theirs. Frequently working with his close-knit troupe of friends and actors, Apatow's style is heavy on improvisation and collaboration. The famous "You know why I know you're gay?" running bit in "Virgin" was improvised, and "Knocked Up" provides a similar gag based on a setup of "You look like..." to describe an extremely hairy character (Martin Starr). A recently released two-disc DVD edition of "Virgin" includes footage of Apatow relentlessly shouting new lines to his actors as they riff their way through a scene &#8212; a method he calls "rewriting while the cameras are rolling." Apatow also holds numerous screenings of early cuts of his films for filmmaker friends in hopes of garnering feedback. "What really sets him apart is just how collaborative he is, and how confident in yourself you have to be in order to be collaborative and take ideas from your actors and your friends," says Rogen, who was a teenager when Apatow cast him in "Freaks and Geeks." "Knocked Up," which was completed in February, arrives in theaters on a sizable wave of buzz, aided by very early screenings to critics and press. As a relatively low-budget film starring the little-known Rogen, it's a film that needs substantial word-of-mouth to compete with summer blockbusters. The low-cost, laugh-heavy approach has proven appealing to studios; "Virgin" grossed $109 million at the box office on a production budget of $26 million. "Knocked Up," rated-R like "Virgin," is also in the same budget range and was well received by Universal Pictures, Apatow says. "They may have just been happy that I didn't ask for triple the budget and robots," he deadpans. Another key to his success is that he's largely been able to keep creative control of his films. Mann says he passed on numerous films before making "Virgin." Now, after years of unsold scripts pilling up, Apatow's projects are getting the green light. Besides "Superbad," this year will also see the release of another Apatow production, "The Pineapple Express," which was written by Rogen. Next year will be "Walk Hard," a mock biopic in the style of "Ray" starring John C. Reilly and "You Don't Mess with the Zohan," which Apatow co-wrote with Sandler. "It's almost more than a Jew from Long Island can handle," Apatow says of his good fortune. "All my assumptions about myself are confused when people like the work. On some level, it's almost more comfortable for it to go the other way." Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

It's Seth Rogen's turn to be the star. After his supporting role in , Steve Carell got the lead in Judd Apatow's . Now for his follow-up, sidekick Rogen gets the lead. He plays a stoner trying to start a celebrity nudity website (unbeknownst of Mrskin.com) who hooks up with the beautiful Katherine Heigl one night. Thanks to a condom mishap, she gets pregnant and now the broke loser has to step up. Even fake movie sex scenes with Katherine Heigl must have been awesome. Were they as great to shoot as it looked? Yeah, it&rsquo;s really kind of nerve wracking, you know. If I was 18 years old, I&rsquo;d literally be as far as I&rsquo;ve ever been with a girl. Essentially you&rsquo;re dry humping. I don&rsquo;t know if you can say that, but I&rsquo;ll say it. You&rsquo;re dry humping a girl who you don&rsquo;t know very well and I was just afraid I was going to sweat on her. That was my major concern, that I was going to drip a big gob of sweat on her head. It&rsquo;s nerves, but luckily they&rsquo;re comedic sex scenes, supposedly. So that kind of helps. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m supposed to be acting sexy. There&rsquo;s lines like, "This is my new record" in there so that kind of alleviates some of the pressure that would be put on me to look attractive and sexy, which is nice. or any other sex comedy an influence on you when you were a kid? Porky&rsquo;s, you mean the highest grossing Canadian film of all time! Yes, that was. Porky&rsquo;s was one of those films. When they played it in Canada, I would tape bits of it, the nude scenes and compile them. So I&rsquo;ve seen the nine minutes of Porky&rsquo;s where people are naked 1000 times over and over. The rest I&rsquo;ve recently caught up on, but that introduced me to adulthood, Porky&rsquo;s. What about other sex comedies? was a movie I always liked. It&rsquo;s pretty dirty for a Tom Hanks movie. There&rsquo;s some bestiality jokes in there and stuff like that, that would always shock me. Kevin Smith was an inspiration language wise, I would say. His movies were the first that I saw that people were cursing up a storm and that was very amusing to me, so I think we took a nod from that, definitely when it comes to sexual language anyway. Are you ready to be the lead in another romantic comedy? We&rsquo;ll see. I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a strange concept, I guess, that romance is what people want to see me do but I had fun, I&rsquo;d keep doing it, sure! Were you familiar with the site Mr. Skin before making this movie? No&hellip;(long pause). Yes, of course I was. Originally in the movie, there was no Mr. Skin. I can&rsquo;t remember how it actually played out, but the movie originally took place in a universe that Mr. Skin did not exist, and it really started to amuse us, the notion that Mr. Skin did exist and we just hadn&rsquo;t heard of it. It just made us laugh a lot as we were writing, so that&rsquo;s where that kind of came from. Yeah, definitely, the idea for our webpage came from Mr. Skin. Was there as much improv here as in 40-Year-Old Virgin? Yes, there was tons of improv in all the scenes, especially the ones with me and my friends. We hired my actual friends because we always hope for those dynamics to kind of show on film. Our hope was to be able to tell we were all friends and we actually all know each other really well and the best way to get that stuff out is just through improv'ing and letting loose. The actual dynamics play out of it. Generally, we shoot the script once or twice and then we just kind of go off. Harold Ramis put it well, he was talking about it, and he said when he did and stuff, he would always say, "The script is the worst case scenario. The script is what we have if we can&rsquo;t think of anything better." That&rsquo;s pretty much what we do, and it was a pretty good script to begin with, so it was a pretty good worse case scenario we all thought. But, we basically said whatever came up. The whole Munich thing, that wasn&rsquo;t even implied in the script at all. That stuff just comes up as you&rsquo;re shooting. You're a new star to a lot of people, so what was your background? As far as my past goes, I started doing stand-up in Vancouver around when I was thirteen and then I got cast for , by Judd, when I was 16 and I moved to LA, and sunk my claws into him and haven&rsquo;t let go ever since. How outrageous and R-rated were you at age 13 when you were doing stand up in Vancouver? I was not. I was clean. I didn&rsquo;t work blue back then. Mostly because my mother came to a lot of my shows I think. I was just embarrassed. My life wasn&rsquo;t that R-rated back then, I guess. I tried to be truthful to what was going on with my life and my friends and my experiences. Then, it was more about my grandparents and playing video games and my Bar Mitzvah and stuff like that. I hadn&rsquo;t delved into the filthy world I now occupy. Where was it where you first did your stand up? At a lesbian bar in Vancouver called The Lotus. I thought it was Ladies Night. I didn&rsquo;t really get what was happening. How did a 13-year-old get hooked up in a lesbian bar? You sign up. The first time, there&rsquo;s actually a workshop that was being held at the bar where you go and basically learn. They tell you the loose format for writing a stand-up joke, and then at the end, you go and perform it for everyone. Then, from there, you just start getting invited out, someone there would say, "I know this other guy who runs this other comedy room," and "why don&rsquo;t you come and do 5 minutes." After that, you kind of get invited to do ten minutes and then you&rsquo;re kind of making 50 bucks a week and you don&rsquo;t need to work at McDonalds. How often are you writing? Pretty much when I&rsquo;m not acting, which is often, I guess. Or doing press. Yeah, as soon as I finish doing the Knocked Up promotion, I will start writing again. And between movies, that&rsquo;s kind of my default mode is sitting in my underwear writing. That&rsquo;s where I want to be, if no one else expects me to be anywhere else. Which creative hat do you enjoy the most? I&rsquo;ve got to say, with movies like Knocked Up, where I have significant amount of input and , which we just did, I really love doing them both. It&rsquo;s hard to pick one. Ideally, I&rsquo;d just keep doing this and be able to wear both hats at once. I view them, they&rsquo;re kind of the same thing to me. They&rsquo;re both kind of making movies, it&rsquo;s not really compartmentalized in two separate halves of my brain, really. It&rsquo;s all part of the same goal and I like to be as involved as I can. How raunchy is Superbad? It's all involving teens, according to the MPAA. That was the big thing. Our prime directive with Superbad was to bring back, unaware of where we were bringing it back from, movies like Fast Times. That stuff we really like and has a really relatable feel to it, and the language feels true to life. We hadn&rsquo;t really seen that when we started writing Superbad. We were 14 years old when we started writing it. It was born out of a very pure desire to see kids acting as how we acted on film, and speak how we speak and spoke. It just happened to be very dirty. And it&rsquo;s also just what made us laugh. When me and my writing partner, Evan Goldberg were writing it, we were teenagers in Vancouver. There was no real implication that it would ever get made into something. It was just to amuse ourselves. And unfortunately, really, really filthy jokes is what amuses us, so that&rsquo;s what we wrote. But, yeah, it was just born out of a desire to see teen characters act like what we acted like when we were in high school. What do you play in As far as Fanboys, I haven&rsquo;t seen the final movie. I play several kind of characters throughout it. My good friend, Jay Baruchel is in it, who is here today.Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know ultimately what my roles in that are. I hope they&rsquo;re funny. It seemed funny when we did it. What&rsquo;s it like to have the Freaks and Geeks gang back together? It&rsquo;s amazing. I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s funny, I look back to Freaks and Geeks and I&rsquo;m terrified how little thought I put into it. I think I was just young and inexperienced and it never really dawned on me that at this time, this was a really great show we were doing and these actors were amazing. It really just seemed so there and given. Looking back, it&rsquo;s a great show with some really talented people involved, and we all got along really well, so I think that&rsquo;s why we all want to keep working together. I just finished a movie with James Franco a few days ago, and it was amazing to be able to work together again. We kept looking at each other saying, "If you told us 8 years ago that someone would allow us to be in a movie that we&rsquo;re the stars of, I would have never believed it." It&rsquo;s amazing to us. How dirty is the humor in Sexually speaking, Pineapple Express is not nearly as dirty as Superbad or maybe even Knocked Up. It&rsquo;s not really a sexual movie. It&rsquo;s more of a marijuana themed, buddy/buddy, comedy, more in the tone of say, How action packed is it? I mean, action wise, it&rsquo;s pretty jammed packed. We&rsquo;ve got car chases and shoot-outs and explosions and me holding many machine guns, which is amusing to me. I hope other people find it entertaining, but when you say you&rsquo;re making an action comedy, it&rsquo;s like anything else. We thought it really has to function as really both as an action and as a comedy; with a romantic comedy, it needs to function in those worlds as well. We took that very seriously.

Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Mischa Barton Better After Memorial Day Mixer Wed, 30 May 2007 10:43:12 AM PDT has apparently been given the all-clear. star spent about two hours in a Los Angeles-area hospital over the weekend, after falling ill at &#39;s Memorial Day barbecue. Barton&#39;s publicist says the starlet suffered an adverse reaction after consuming a few cocktails on top of the prescription antibiotics she was taking for a persistent case of bronchitis. "She is fine now," said a statement from publicist Leslie Sloane Zelnik. The statement said Barton left Tuesday for an undisclosed overseas location to begin work on a new movie. No further details were available regarding her condition, but a source told TMZ that the 21-year-old Barton was "resting comfortably" shortly after being admitted to Sherman Oaks Hospital and that her mother and sister were by her side throughout. The star of the upcoming period romance has reportedly been battling bronchitis for the past several weeks, appearing under the weather in Cannes, Paris and London. In a radio interview with E!&#39;s Wednesday, Richie, who hosted the bash at a friend&#39;s house, said she was not there when Barton fell ill because she was making a run to the grocery store at the time. "She&#39;s good. She just mixed antibiotics and alcohol and got sick," Richie said. Since the party, the star has been busy doing damage control on her own behalf after the intentionally silly party invitation she sent out to friends fell into the wrong set of tabloid-editing hands. "My fellow Americans it&#39;s that time of year to celebrate our country by drinking massive amounts of beer," the invitation began. "Let&#39;s stand together as one, live the American dream/Take shots, pass out, & wake up with our pants ripped open at the seems/Let&#39;s glorify this day in your sluttiest tops and your tightest pair of tsubi jeans/Even though we have no [expletive] clue what Memorial Day really means!!" Followed by this addendum: "There will be a scale at the front door. No girls over 100 pounds allowed in. Start starving yourself now. See you all then!!!" Richie was unapologetic about the invite, telling Seacrest it was meant to be funny and was never meant to become public. "It&#39;s a private email. I&#39;m sending it to my friends as a joke. I didn&#39;t mean to make it public and I have every right to say what I want to my friends," she said. "It&#39;s not that deep. I wanted to write something that rhymes. I don&#39;t even know what to say about it. I&#39;m not a serious person at all and no one thinks that I am." Her rep, Nicole Perna, backed her up, stating: "This invitation was sent via email to her friends who understand that she was responding in a joking manner to the constant untruths printed about her in the media. "Her reference to Memorial Day was in no way meant to offend anyone but was simply an expression of her distaste for the current situation." Richie was at a loss as to which of the many friends on her invite list forwarded her missive on to unintended recipients. "It really makes me question who I trust in my life," she said.

Not only was the invite in poor taste, but her comment concerning the meaning of Memorial Day was offensive to the families and friends of military personnel, whether deceased, retired or currently serving this country. I personally see nothing cute or funny about it. Just my opinion. ciscomama on 05/30/2007 9:38AM I actually think her ... I actually think her invite is quite funny!

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/8-6&fd=R&url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-miller/laughing-with-charles-nel_b_49681.html&cid=1116757130&ei=muxeRqWaCpj2qgO93JjZDQ Danny Miller: Laughing with Charles Nelson Reilly | The Huffington Post Laughing with Charles Nelson Reilly Posted May 28, 2007 I was lucky enough to know Charles Nelson Reilly, one of the funniest people on the planet. Reilly died this weekend after a very long illness, and today is being mourned by his showbiz colleagues, the public at large, and his legions of former acting students. Charles' oft-stated concern that when he died the headlines would read "Game Show Fixture Passes Away" has come true in part (I saw that exact headline on several news sites) but plenty of people also remember his Tony Award-winning performances in the theatre and his amazing work as a director of plays and opera. My wife Kendall Hailey was a close friend of Charles and his partner Patrick. He jokingly called her his fiancÃ©e during much of their friendship and somewhere there is a fake prom photo that Charles staged in the 1980s with Kendall in a ghastly taffeta dress and Charles wearing a frilly tuxedo and a purposely bad toupee. Kendall used it as her Christmas card that year and her conservative Texas grandparents were concerned about her "boyfriend" who seemed so much older. Kendall could almost be considered a Love Child of "The Match Game." Charles' sparring partner, Brett Somers, is Kendall's godmother, and as far as I'm concerned, her biggest claim to fame was when Brett wrote "Happy Birthday Kendall" on one of her "Match Game" cards when Kendall was a kid and held it up to the camera, prompting a discussion about her birthday with host Gene Rayburn. I still love watching the old "Match Game" episodes on the Game Show Network. In my opinion some of the best comedy ever seen on television came from the impromptu antics of Charles and Brett on that show. They got away with a ribald, wicked repartee that would never be allowed on network television today--at least not without massive FCC fines. As anyone who met him knows, from his celebrity friends to the fans on the street to his nurses in the hospital, being in Charles' presence was like being a willing victim of a high energy tsunami. Hearing him tell anecdotes about his crazy life was irresistible and you never wanted him to stop, he was so much fun to be around. He seemed to know everyone in showbiz, from the sublime to the ridiculous, and he spoke reverentially of many of his talented friends, including Uta Hagen and Julie Harris. He directed Miss Harris in "The Belle of Amherst" and an acclaimed revival of "The Gin Game," after starring with her decades earlier in the musical "Skyscraper." As a child I was most familiar with Charles as Claymore Gregg in the TV series, "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir," as well as the villainous magician Horatio J. HooDoo in the freaky Sid and Marty Krofft series "Lidsville" from the early 70s. The writers of this show may not have consciously been making drug references in the scripts but it's hard to believe that the person who created this land of living hats wasn't smoking something! Reading some of the accolades today, I am struck by the diversity of the people from all walks of life who loved him. Charles was one of the first openly gay men on television, and probably did more to promote gay rights than many activists marching in the street. My brother-in-law, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, was a huge Charles fan. A few years ago, when Jeff was in town mixing the Wilco CD "Summerteeth," we brought Charles to the recording studio for a visit. Charles immediately had the entire rock crowd under his spell. They all wanted to pose for pictures with him and they seemed more excited to see Charles than if a member of the Rolling Stones had wandered in. Someone handed him a CD by a band called the Didjits called "Full Nelson Reilly" and Charles signed it to Jeff, "From one rock star to another." Kendall's favorite Charles story takes place when he was appearing in New York and staying at the Wyndham Hotel. Charles found himself riding in the elevator alone with Sir Laurence Olivier. He said nothing to Olivier on the way up but as the elevator door opened, Charles turned to the renowned actor and deadpanned, "If I'd known this was a theatrical establishment, I would have booked elsewhere." Charles had a great sense of humor about all things, including himself. Has there ever been anyone more parodied than he was? Remember Alec Baldwin's killer impersonation on "Saturday Night Live?" Charles didn't stop working until he got sick, and he was known to more recent audiences as Jose Chung on "The X Files" and "Millennium" and the voice of the Dirty Bubble on "SpongeBob SquarePants." I wish I could have seen Charles in his early plays which included "Bye, Bye Birdie," "Hello, Dolly," and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying."

Paula Abdul says she didn't figure out her purpose in life until she became a judge on Fox network's "American Idol." NEW YORK- Paula Abdul says she didn't figure out her purpose in life until she became a judge on Fox network's "American Idol." "I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on 'American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of 'American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul&mdash;who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s&mdash;says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of 'American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer." Fox is a unit of News Corp.

Sony disputed the record, saying that its Spider-Man 3 still held the six-day record because Pirates was actually released a day earlier than scheduled in both France and Italy, Variety reported. Spider-Man 3 earned "just" 382 million dollars during its first six days and 418 million dollars in the first seven days. Mark Zoradi, president of motion-picture marketing and distribution for Walt Disney Studios, said the massive ticket sales showed that Pirates has "truly become a cultural phenomenon all over the world." "The global box office returns have continued to exceed our expectations and estimates," he was quoted by DPA as saying. The film&#039;s performance was especially strong internationally, where it earned 251 million dollars, 62 per cent of its take. It boasted record-breaking openings in 17 territories, including Argentina, Ecuador, Holland, Iceland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, Panama, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine and Venezuela. The movie is yet to open in two key markets: India, where it launches Friday, and China, where it opens June 10.
