Evans There are a few original ideas in this new spin on the serial killer thriller, but they tend to get bogged down in a plot that's slow, convoluted and even more schizophrenic than Mr. Brooks himself. Earl Brooks (Kevin Costner) is a well-respected businessman and a loving husband and father, who just so happens to also be a brutal, methodical serial killer who has never been caught until a photographer (Dane Cook) gets pictures of him in the act and threatens to reveal his secret unless he takes him along on his next killing. Meanwhile, a tough detective (Demi Moore) is trying to catch the killer while dealing with a bitter divorce and other more dangerous problems. You don't have to wait too long while watching this psychological thriller before the big reveal that Kevin Costner's highly-lauded business magnate Earl Brooks has a secret addiction to killing people. Even before we see him in action, we learn how this secret affects him in the form of William Hurt's Marshall, a talkative alter ego who acts as Brooks' bad conscious, egging him on to do these very bad things. This idea was just as interesting when used in "Fight Club" and "Harvey," but here it's revealed way too early and then it's quickly overused to the point where it gets tiresome. Obviously, director Bruce A. Evans, who's written many strong movies and a couple weaker ones, knows where the money lies in his twist on the serial killer genre, and that's in the interplay between Kevin Coster and William Hurt as the good and evil within this conflicted family man. It's not a bad role for Costner, because we get to see him playing with a few more emotions and moods than we've seen from him in the past, but for the most part, he's a bit too soft and sympathetic in the role, which is why it's good to have Hurt around as the bad guy, to take the heat off Costner while continuing down the path he began in Cronenberg's "A History of Violence." Essentially, Marshall appears in most of the scenes having side conversations with Mr. Brooks as he deals with his own conscience and desire to give up killing, but that plan hits a stumbling block when a photographer played by Dane Cook blackmails Brooks into including him in his next killing. Cook isn't bad as the pesky tagalong in his first dramatic role, and the shaky relationship between the duo adds another level to the tense relationship between Brooks and his alter ego, but Marshall probably puts it best when he says, "He could be funny and charming and I still wouldn't like him." It's almost like Marshall is saying exactly what we, the viewer, is thinking, because Cook might only be bearable if you're already a fan of his neurotic overly-caffeinated personality. The last player in the story is Demi Moore's Detective Tracy Atwood, the criminal profiler who has been trailing Brooks (known as "The Thumbprint Killer") for years, and has been having difficulty settling a messy divorce case with her ex-husband who wants a sizeable chunk of her trust fund. (At first, you may wonder how he can possibly expect to get a $1.5 million settlement from a police detective, but it's explained soon enough.) Even if her character is very much a stereotype in the mold of Clarice Starling or Angelina Jolie's character from "Taking Lives," it's a fine return to form by Moore as a tough female character who might have been just as interesting a character to follow as Brooks and his associates. For a purported thriller, "Mr. Brooks" is fairly tame, not offering anything really surprising or shocking after Brooks' first on-screen murders, his weapon of choice making it fairly quick work. Otherwise, the movie is very slow, consisting mainly of talking heads scenes between the various characters and a ridiculous number of overlapping subplots, many of which don't seem particularly necessary to tell the main story, which should be about how Mr. Brooks copes with his addiction and his alter ego. The tone switches drastically whenever Costner is dealing with his drama at home involving his daughter Jane, leading to another tangential subplot, but they also needlessly try to build-up Moore's character with excessive conflicts. At the same time as this mess divorce, she also has to contend with an escaped serial killer trying to get revenge on her for putting him away. It gets confusing as Atwood is looking for Brooks one moment and the next she's off after this other escaped killer. This latter part offers the movie's only real action scenes, all of which come from out of nowhere as if Evans realizes he's losing people with the amount of talking and needs to throw in a few shootouts and the like to show how tough Moore is as a police officer. (Her partner is noticeably absent whenever she's caught in these conflicts.) It just doesn't seem like a very well developed or structured script--holding off the Costner/Hurt relationship for thirty minutes would have helped greatly--and the standard dialogue is only elevated by the fact that Evans has such a strong cast delivering it, with Hurt clearly getting the best role and lines, as he voices his opinion on everything going around Brooks and offers his malignant advice. Unfortunately, he also telegraphs a lot of what's going to happen and what Brooks is going to do, and there aren't any interesting twists or scares until the very end, when we finally get to see Costner show Brooks' evil without Hurt acting as his crutch. It's another one of those cases where nothing happens for so long that something had to happen eventually or one might feel cheated. Still, it's a shame that with two of the '90s strongest dramatic actors in Costner and Moore, we never get to see a single scene of the two on-screen together, something that would have certainly added another level to the movie and seems like a missed opportunity. "Mr. Brooks" isn't the worst thriller ever made, though there's a certain '90s throwback quality to it that takes away from it feeling particularly new or innovative. If you feel the need to see yet another twist on the serial killer genre than "Mr. Brooks" offers a few things to make it worthwhile, particularly the interplay between Costner and Hurt as the title character, but the convoluted plot and plodding pace kills any sense of there being any actual thrills involved.

Let's go to Potterland Harry Potter, played by Daniel Radcliffe, attempts to defend himself as the Dementors attack in the forthcoming movie Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Photograph: Murray Close/Warner Bros Until now the legions of Harry Potter fans have had to make do with visiting the rather underwhelming at King's Cross station or recreating Quidditch games with the kitchen mop. But not for much longer. It's been long in the rumour mill but Harry Potter fans will soon be able to enjoy the magic of Hogwarts at a Harry Potter theme park Followers of the teenage wizard will be able to visit many of the famous locations that have been brought to life in the Potter series, such as Hogwarts castle, the village of Hogsmeade and the mysterious Forbidden Forest. Creators of the park say they aim to create an authentic representation of JK Rowling's vision. The park is not due to open until 2009 at Universal Studio's amusement park in Orlando, Florida, but what are a few more years when you've waited a decade already? And true Harry Potter fans will have mastered the art of waiting thanks to many weeks' practice, bearing up under the media hype preceding each new book and film release. It also leaves plenty of time for fans to imagine what would go into their own Harry Potter World - surely almost as much fun as going on the rides themselves. Suggestions on several fans' websites already include: Soar through the air on your very own hippogriff. (Picture something like the Flying Dumbo ride at Disney World.) The Whomping Whillow ride: This would have separate arm cages that people would get in (think of an octopus). Then all the arms would go up into the air, and swing into the centre, or out, as the base rotated. This is an indoor version of Disneyland's Matterhorn ride, but bigger, with laser effects and spooky sounds. At least some of the ride operators should be dressed as Dementors. JK Rowling's books have sold 325 million copies worldwide and inspired five blockbuster movies so creators are confident the theme park will be a hit - although some fans may be dismayed to hear it is going to be based in the US rather than its literary home, the UK.

But still, Daniel Radcliffe is touchingly coy when I ask him about Harry Potter's first screen kiss. As readers of JK Rowling's novels know, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is the one where the 15-year-old boy wizard starts grappling with manhood. In the film, the fifth in the blockbuster series, Radcliffe (actual age, 17) has to act out this rite of passage with Katie Leung, 18, who plays Harry's new love interest, Cho Chang. "We shot it for a day," Radcliffe tells me, with a shy smile. "We did about 30 takes. Katie and I were both a bit awkward and nervous at first, but once we got into it, it was fine." The kiss was possibly even more of an event for David Yates, the British director of the latest instalment, and his crew, many of whom have worked with Radcliffe since he was 11. "They were gathered around the monitor and needed to see this moment," Yates says. "They had seen Dan go through all these changes as he's grown up - he is like a son to them, they got quite emotional." If Harry Potter has come a long way as a character, so too has the industry that surrounds Hogwarts' star pupil. Before the latest film finished shooting earlier this year, I visited Leavesden Studios in Hertfordshire to talk to Radcliffe and Yates on set. The studio, a former aircraft hangar which was converted into a film facility for the James Bond film GoldenEye 12 years ago, is now the permanent home of Harry Potter. Warner Bros has a further six-year lease on the studios to complete the final two films with Radcliffe. On my visit, I am allowed to wander through the sets - a spectacle in itself. It's no surprise that there is talk of creating a theme park or permanent exhibition out of it all when the series ends. I walk through the atrium to the Ministry of Magic which is modelled after a Victorian Underground station and is where the new film's climactic battle takes place. I pass on to the Hall of Prophecies, the Room of Requirement, Dumbledore's crowded study, and the Court of Justice where we first meet this film's arch nemesis, Dolores Umbridge (Imelda Staunton). The detail in each construction is remarkable. Away from the sound stages is Privet Drive, where Harry lives with his aunt and uncle, and a chapel-like building attached to Hogwarts that plays a key part in the drama. Each film employs hundreds of crew members and actors for each 11-month shoot. The budget for the Order of the Phoenix is estimated at &pound;150 million. The prop department is now the biggest in the world, and some of the sets - notably Hogwarts Great Hall - are lifesize constructions which have been used in each film. The massive hall has a floor built of original York stone. The benches and tables in it were distressed to look ancient for the first film. Six years later, they are now genuinely distressed after being used repeatedly by the cast and 320 local schoolchildren, shipped in as extras to play Hogwarts students. Radcliffe has grown up on this set - but still, he tells me, nothing quite prepared him for the demands of the fifth film. "It's not physically challenging like the fourth one, but in terms of the acting it's a lot harder." His first snog is not all he has to cope with: Harry is racked by the guilt he feels over Cedric Diggory's death at the end of the last film, and must come to terms with the death of Sirius Black (played by Gary Oldman), his mentor and godfather, at the hands of evil death-eater Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter). "Doing the real isolation and anger and hurt he feels has been a challenge," Radcliffe admits. "Thankfully I've never been bereaved in my life so I don't know what it's like, but it is incredibly difficult to act the Sirius stuff." Potter Five is a more emotionally complex film than the previous four, and producers David Heyman and David Barron have continued their tradition of enlisting a new director each time the series takes a new turn. Following Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n's dark fourth film, Yates, who hasn't made a single feature film, nevertheless brings to the fifth an impressive list of successful, grown-up television work - State of Play, Sex Traffic and The Girl in the Caf&eacute;, all of which attracted critical admiration. His is a name to conjure with among the Hollywood elite, and State of Play - Paul Abbott's edge-of-the-seat political thriller from 2003, which starred Bill Nighy as an editor trying to link two murders - is being remade this summer with Brad Pitt in the lead role and Kevin Macdonald (The Last King of Scotland) directing. "That went down particularly well in the States," Yates says. "JJ Abrams [who created Lost] said he was passing episodes around, like a kind of banned substance. It's very flattering." Yates is a far cry from Chris Columbus, who made the first two films: a Hollywood A-list director known for family movies such as Mrs Doubtfire and Home Alone. "The work I've done has a large emotional content," Yates says, " it's very character-driven, and the core part of this fifth book is a very emotional story. Harry Potter has no mum or dad and he clings to this relationship with Sirius Black. So I think what they were looking for when they asked me to do this was to make sure we had a story that felt emotionally rich. It's rawer, edgier, darker and tougher. My contribution will be to grow the films up, as the books are growing up." The ageing process has been a delicate issue all round, but particularly for the young stars of the series, Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (who plays Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger), when Warner Bros wanted them to commit to the sixth and seventh films. Radcliffe and Grint reached a deal fairly quickly, but Watson was slow to sign. "Daniel and Rupert seem so sure," she told US magazine Newsweek last year. "I love to perform, but there are so many things I love doing. Maybe that sounds ungrateful. I've been given such an amazing opportunity, but I'll just have to go with the flow." She did finally succumb, for a reported $4 million a film, but not before Grint was quoted as saying that he and Radcliffe were "distant from her now. We don't text or talk to her when we're not filming." JK Rowling has also announced that the final book in the series of seven, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, will be published around the world on 21 July, one week after the fifth film hits cinemas. A major character is going to die, she warns the legion of Potter fans. "I'll go with whatever she writes," Radcliffe says, philosophically. "I think it will be quite exciting if the only way that Voldemort could be killed is if Harry dies as well. There is a very strong connection between them. But I don't know yet. I've had talks with [Rowling] but not about that ..." As to his relationship with the other child actors in the film, Radcliffe is open and polite. "I think when you're thrown together with two people who you haven't known previously and you end up spending the next six years together, you had better get on. We're very lucky that we do." He pauses before adding, "I haven't really seen them outside of the films." Watching Yates directing the three young stars in take after take, there doesn't seem to be any hierarchy or tension among them. Their respective guardians - Radcliffe's father included - crowd around the monitor watching their wards, who cannot perform without an adult relative on set until they reach 18. I wonder what it has been like growing up in a bizarre extended family on one of the most elaborate movie sets in cinema history. "It's something that hasn't really been seen before to this extent," Radcliffe says. "We're a group of kids growing up on-screen. It's sort of an interesting cinematic experiment." Indeed it is. But we'll have to wait until next month to find out how it's progressing. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is released on 12 July.

Its great to see a kid outside hunting instead of sitting in front on the tv or playing dumb computer games. I hope he kills a bigger one next year. Congrats May 31st, 2007 - 15:41:09 I really get annoyed when people who have no knowledge of gun saftey or hunting traditions make ignorant comments. This 11 year old boy was out hunting with the supervision of his father. He was obviously taught at a young age how to properly & safely handle a firearm. He is not going to be the child who causes an accident because of this. What is really dangerous is when an ignorant adult man who has never had training decides that one day he wants to go hunting & then buys a gun that he has no idea how to use & goes out without supervision because it is ok & he is an adult. That's what I am afraid of. Gun saftey starts with education & boys who are interested in hunting should be educated properly & early on. The best education is supervised experience. May 31st, 2007 - 15:46:24 sorry, I was raised to be kind to living creatures. Hunting and killing is a 'tradition' lost on me. There are too many gun toting kids for my taste too. Sue me.

Paula Abdul is the latest celebrity to slate the young Hollywood stars, but in a thinly veiled way which will no doubt save her the scathing defensive words from Lohan and the rest. Speaking to OK! Magazine, the American Idol judge says: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." If anyone needed a role model, I think we may have just found the woman! Abdul goes on to tell about how she suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God. I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years." Not pleasant by anyone's standards. And in case you were wondering why she sometimes looks groggy while on American Idol? "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am! I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain." Young Hollywood don't realise how easy they have it... There are no reader comments.

http://www.theage.com.au/news/people/lohan-returns-to-rehab/2007/05/30/1180205289336.html&cid The Age: national, world, business, entertainment, sport and technology news from Melbourne's leading newspaper. Welcome to The Age. Lohan returns to rehab Lindsay Lohan has gone back into rehab. Lohan drink driving citation Actress Lindsay Lohan has returned to rehab after a weekend drunken-driving arrest, her publicist said on Tuesday, raising questions about whether she can start shooting her latest film as planned. Official word that Lohan was back in treatment came hours after entertainment trade paper said she had just joined the cast of , a comedy starring Shirley MacLaine and set to begin filming this week. "Lindsay admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility on Memorial Day. Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation," the publicist's statement said. No further details were given. But several celebrity news outlets, including TMZ.com and magazine online, said Lohan checked in on Monday to the Promises treatment center in Malibu, the luxury facility where pop star Britney Spears was recently a patient. Lohan, 20, underwent a stint in rehab earlier this year after spending months as an underage regular on the Hollywood party and nightclub circuit. The actress, who shot to fame in Disney films such as , also said in December she had been attending Alcoholics Anonymous for about a year. But her Beverly Hills arrest on Saturday on suspicion of driving under the influence, and police reports that a substance believed to be cocaine was found in the car, triggered a wave of headlines trumpeting Hollywood's latest celebrity relapse. According to TMZ's report, Lohan was admitted to Promises for in-patient treatment, possibly for 30 days, sparking questions about a potential conflict with her new film. Representatives for the film's production company, Still Rolling Prods., and MacLaine, who also is co-producing the film, were not immediately available for comment. But it would not be the first time that Lohan's personal life has put her at odds with demands of her career. Last July, the producer of took the unusual step of going public with a letter to Lohan scolding her for repeatedly showing up late on the set. In his unusual reprimand, the Morgan Creek Prods. executive James Robinson called her behavior "discourteous, irresponsible and unprofessional" and cited her "ongoing all-night heavy partying" as the reason for her tardiness. Lohan returned to work the next day, and , which paired her with film legend Jane Fonda, was released earlier this month. When you see news happening: SMS/MMS: 0406 THE AGE (0406 843 243), or us.

NEW YORK - A pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in âBreakfast at Tiffanyâsâ was auctioned Wednesday for nearly $200,000 â more than six times what the auctioneers expected. The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, sold for $192,000 to a private European buyer at Christieâs sale of film and entertainment memorabilia. The auction house said it had expected the dress to sell for as much as $30,000. âThe sale was filled with iconic pieces,â said Helen Hall, Christieâs head of entertainment memorabilia. âIt captured peopleâs imagination.â Hall said the auction house was pleased with the results of the sale, which brought in $1.2 million. Other items on the block included Marilyn Monroeâs script for âSomethingâs Got To Give,â with the actressâ handwritten notes, which sold for $19,200. A program from President John F. Kennedyâs birthday celebration that featured the actress at Madison Square Garden went for $66,000. All the prices include the Christieâs commission. Â© 2007 The Associated Press.

http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18950473/&cid Harry Potter theme park set to open - TODAY: Books - MSNBC.com Harry Potter theme park set to open Wizarding World of Harry Potter will open in Orlando in 2009 Harry Potter comes to Orlando theme park May 31: Imagine walking through the Forbidden Forest or Hogwarts Castle? Your dreams can come true when it opens in 2009. Soon you will no longer have to worry about dirtying your robes with soot while traveling the Floo Network, suffering the uncomfortable sensations of apparition or stumbling upon a port key in order to reach the magical world of Harry Potter. Within three years, the only thing youâll have to conjure up is a ticket to Orlando, Fla. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. and Universal Orlando Resort plan to open The Wizarding World of Harry Potter within Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park in 2009, Tom Williams, chairman and CEO of Universal Parks and Resorts, announced Thursday on TODAY.Â  The âtheme park within a theme parkâ is the first fully immersive Harry Potter-themed environment based on the best-selling books by J.K. Rowling and the blockbuster feature films. "The plans I've seen look incredibly exciting, and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed," Rowling said in a press release.Â  Williams said Rowling has been collaborating on the park from the beginning and will continue to do so through the opening. Artist's rendering of Hogsmeade village Visitors can stroll about Hogsmeade, discover the mysteries of the Forbidden Forest and explore Hogwarts castle. "(Visitors will) be able to sense the sights, the sound, the touch and the feel, the smells and really immerse themselves in this authentic world," Williams said. Stuart Craig, the Academy-Award winning production designer who has worked on the Harry Potter movies, is leading the creative design on the park to ensure it remains true to the look and feel of the films. âOur primary goal is to make sure this experience is an authentic extension of Harry Potterâs world as it is portrayed in the books and films,â Craig said in a press release.Â  The Wizarding World will feature rides, shops and restaurants all based on the fictional world of Harry Potter. The announcement of the park adds to the current Harry Potter frenzy; the seventh and final book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," will be release on July 21 and the fifth film, "The Order of the Phoenix," opens in theater on July 13.

The Oversight Congress: How Democrats gain Social conservatives bite bullet, back Rudy May 30, 2007 06:35 AM EST The message winked coyly at salivating pop watchers on Monday&rsquo;s episode of &ldquo;The View,&rdquo; as the alphabet unfairly flirted with those of us hoping beyond reason. Rosie was on, being her rosy self, and all seemed right with the delicate &ldquo;big, fat lesbian&rdquo; versus &ldquo;innocent, pure Christian&rdquo; balance of the universe. But, alas, Memorial Day&rsquo;s episode was &ldquo;previously recorded.&rdquo; Damn the technology that brought us the rerun! &ldquo;The View&rdquo; is the best&mdash;the guiltiest of guilty pleasures. But this year has been the super best of all because of Rosie O&rsquo;Donnell, the former comedian/successful talk show host/failed Broadway producer/Democrat/lesbian. With her obligatory male bashing (Bush, Trump and more Bush) O&rsquo;Donnell made &ldquo;The View&rdquo; actually watchable&mdash;something no longer relegated to the ether of TiVo or sneaked through head phones at work when we should be watching CNN. She even made the show CNN-able. With O&rsquo;Donnell the Democrat, Barbara Walters the who-knows-what, Joy Behar the other Democrat and Elisabeth Hasselbeck the super Republican, &ldquo;The View&rdquo; made politics a regular condiment in the morning, almost as good as coffee but with fewer calories. Politics, women, roundtables and not-PBS are virtually unheard of. The show was, for all intents and purposes, kind of groundbreaking this year. But that&rsquo;s all over now since the incident. It all started when O&rsquo;Donnell purportedly compared U.S. troops to terrorists with this quote: &ldquo;655,000 Iraqi civilians are dead. Who are the terrorists?&rdquo; Which, to be fair, is a bit misleading. Either she was accusing America, President Bush, Vice President Cheney or the troops (or maybe even Donald Trump) of being a terrorist&mdash;but someone was being called a terrorist, and in a post-9/11 world that&rsquo;s a dirty word, right? O&rsquo;Donnell implied something vague, which allowed the rest of the world to infer something equally vague. That&rsquo;s when the pundits took to the Internet and accused her of being, at the very least, unpatriotic. &ldquo;When is someone going to sue this liar? She needs to be held accountable for her words,&rdquo; wrote one commenter on the conservative website freerepublic.com. The Media Research Center, a group that tracks liberal bias in the media, has been profiling O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s &ldquo;more noteworthy left-wing outbursts&rdquo; in a &ldquo;report&rdquo; called &ldquo;The Full Rosie.&rdquo; Hasselbeck didn&rsquo;t have her back, says Rosie. TV violence then ensued. From the &ldquo;big fight&rdquo; show: The O&rsquo;Donnell: &ldquo;Do you believe I think our troops are terrorists, Elisabeth? Yes or no?&rdquo; Innocent Elisabeth: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t put suggestions out there that lead people to think things and then not answer my own question.&rdquo; Joy, the voice of reason: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t yell at each other, please let&rsquo;s have a conversation,&rdquo; she pleaded. &ldquo;Why is this personal? There&rsquo;s a war going on out there.&rdquo; Then the terms &ldquo;coward,&rdquo; &ldquo;cowardly,&rdquo; &ldquo;emotions&rdquo; and &ldquo;facts&rdquo; came up. And therein lies the real travesty about O&rsquo;Donnell&rsquo;s rushed departure: why can&rsquo;t women talk about politics without taking it personally? People talk about the lack of female pundits (I have in this paper), one reason being that they don&rsquo;t value &ldquo;chest-thumpery&rdquo; and &ldquo;shouting shows.&rdquo; But last week&rsquo;s episode of &ldquo;The View&rdquo; was just that&mdash;a bunch of chicks shouting at each other (in split-screen time no less) about their hurt feelings. So far, there are more than 9,000 signatures on fireelisabethhasselbeck.com, but according to Tuesday's show&mdash;the first without O&rsquo;Donnell in the moderator&rsquo;s chair&mdash;the two firebrands have &ldquo;started the process of forgiveness.&rdquo; Still, there&rsquo;s a sterling silver lining to this dust-up&mdash;Star Jones-Reynolds is probably out somewhere having a congratulatory double-fudge sundae. read all 102 comments Replies: 102 Viewed: 121 Date: May. 30, 2007 - 7:57 AM EST Well, it looks like they finally got back at Rosie for all the 9/11 talk. Fire her for being too obnoxious and disrupting the show. DO NOT fire her for speaking her mind, even if it's occasionally incoherent in the heat of trash television.

PS Contrary to popular opinion on the left, criticizing the speech of liberals is NOT an oppression of their free speech rights. As much as liberals would like to censor other points of view, silence other voices, free speech means that others get to speak their minds, too.

Who considers Ms. O'Donnel merely a 'Democrat' while soft-spoken Hasselback is a 'Super Republican?'

Americans are dangerously ignorant, quick to judge and slow to think. The idea of American culture leading the world is frightening. Rosie's choice of words may heve been careless--she probably meant something more like 'enemy' ('terrorist' has too much propoganda and emotion attached to it), but her basic point, that we need to look at things from the Iraqi or Middle Eastern point of view, is important.

"Knocked Up," in theaters Friday, was written and directed by Judd Apatow, who was the executive producer of "Freaks and Geeks." In casting his film, he essentially stockpiled actors from the beloved show about two bands of early `80s high school misfits. Seth Rogen (Ken Miller in "Freaks and Geeks") stars in the movie, which also includes Jason Segel (who played Nick Andopolis in "Freaks and Geeks"), Martin Starr (Bill Haverchuck) and a cameo from James Franco (Daniel Desario). To provide just a taste of the deep appreciation fans have for "Freaks and Geeks," it has a 9.5 rating on Imdb.com. That puts it a full 0.4 ahead of the highest-rated film, "The Godfather." "Freaks and Geeks" fans don't just think it was a good TV show, they believe it's one of the greatest achievements in pop culture. (They're right. The breach of journalistic objectivity is, in this case, worth it.) Those who made the show feel similarly. "I'm almost a stalker with it," says Apatow, who also directed "The 40 Year-Old Virgin." "I truly believe those people exist somewhere right now and I don't see them as actors. "The funny thing is for me, I don't even feel like I was part of it anymore when I watch it. I feel a real separation from the work and I can watch it as if it's its own living thing -- and I really like it." The hourlong show -- sometimes called a "dramedy" -- was critically acclaimed and won an Emmy in 2000 for outstanding casting for a comedy series. It was nominated for outstanding writing for a comedy series in 2000 and again in 2001. Nevertheless, NBC canceled it before its first season was over. In 2004, Shout! Factory released a six-disc DVD set of all 18 episodes and with extensive commentaries and special features. "When we realized it was going to end, it was like killing the characters," says Apatow, who also suffered early cancellations of "The Ben Stiller Show" and "Undeclared." "It was our lives." The show's creator, Paul Feig, plays a tiny role in "Knocked Up" too, (look for him among the fantasy baseball players). Since "Freaks and Geeks," he's directed episodes of "The Office," "Arrested Development" and "30 Rock." Perhaps the two biggest stars produced by "Freaks and Geeks" are Franco, who has starred in the "Spider-Man" films, and Linda Cardellini, who is a regular on "ER" as nurse Samantha Taggart. (Busy Philipps, who played Kim Kelly on "Freaks and Geeks," also co-stars on "ER.") Now a director and producer of lucrative summer movies, Apatow says he made "Knocked Up" with the tone of "Freaks and Geeks" in mind: realistic, touching and hysterical. While the critical response for "Knocked Up" has been very positive -- just as it was for "Virgin" -- Apatow says: "I don't think I'll ever make anything as good as `Freaks and Geeks.'" &#169; 2007 The Associated Press.

http://www.actressarchives.com/news.php%3Fid%3D5910&cid Celebrity News - Dress worn by Hepburn sells for $192,000 Dress worn by Hepburn sells for $192,000 BY: Actress Archives | Thursday, May 31, 2007 A dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's that was expected to sell at auction for around $30,000 went for much more, going for $192,000 at an auction this week. The pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the classic film was sold this week at a sale of film and entertainment memorabilia at Christie's in New York. Mania over Audrey Hepburn and especially Breakfast at Tiffany's continues to grow every year. Last year a black Givenchy dress that was worn by Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast at Tiffany's caused a frenzy at auction, selling for almost a million dollars. The pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn is in the scene where Holly Golightly learns about her brother's death and smashes her crockery in a fit of grief, according to the BBC. The news service also reports that the now-expensive dress was a late addition to the film. The auction also included a program from the birthday celebration for John F. Kennedy at Madison Square Garden in May of 1962 - the infamous affair where Marilyn Monroe serenaded her favorite president. That program sold for around $66,000. Some items from the estate of Stan Laurel (of Laurel & Hardy fame) sold for around $100,000. Some of the Laurel items included a set of trademark hats, bow ties and a folder full of joke ideas, including the gem, " Rather be pregnant than have tooth pulled? Make up your mind lady, so I'll know which way to tilt the chair. Audrey Hepburn was nominated for best actress for her work in Breakfast at Tiffany's, but lost to Sophia Loren for her work in Two Women. Believe it or not, the legendary Audrey Hepburn only has 30 credits in IMDB. The world-famous actress, who passed away in 1993, is most well-known for her work in Roman Holiday, Sabrina, Funny Face, Love in the Afternoon, The Unforgiven, Breakfast at Tiffany's, The Children's Hour, Charade, My Fair Lady, Two For the Road, Wait Until Dark, and Robin and Marian.

William Hurt, left, is the bad-influence alter ego of serial killer Kevin Costner. Pushing coincidence and exaggeration to the point of near comic absurdity, "Mr. Brooks" begins as a steely cool examination of an unlikely serial killer, but it quickly tumbles off that edge into a quagmire of plot gimmicks and writer&#39;s tricks. "Brooks" is the second directing gig by screenwriter Bruce A. Evans ("Stand by Me") from a script he wrote with his longtime partner Raynold Gideon. These two are fine studio writers, but, unleashed from the shackles of the studio development system, they succumb to an urge to explore the dark side of life yet do so without dramatic logic or, for that matter, a moral compass. The film feels sleazy and nasty -- but without the pulp kick of filmmakers who know how to do sleazy and nasty. The two key roles, wallowing in obsession and ambiguity, were superficially juicy enough to attract Kevin Costner (who even produces) and Demi Moore. But they have little to play: The characters are the equivalent of junkies who plunge needles into their veins over and over without the movie giving any reason for the compulsive, self-destructive behavior. Fans might show up at theaters, but such roles are the kind likely to reduce that fan base. As counterprogramming to the summer silly season, this adult thriller might attract a decent turnout for a couple of weeks, after which the film will become a DVD curio. Evans&#39; serial killer, Earl Brooks (Costner), isn&#39;t just an ordinary guy with a secret life but Portland&#39;s Man of the Year in honor of his civic and philanthropic activities. And not just any philanthropist/serial killer but one with his own stalker, a peeping Tom photographer (Dane Cook) who saw him butcher a naked couple having sex, and a daughter (Danielle Panabaker) who comes home from college with a hatchet murder on her resume. Evans&#39; bulldog police detective Tracy Atwood (Moore) isn&#39;t just any ordinary cop but a $60 million heiress who undertakes police work as a hobby. And not just any detective/heiress but one with a nasty divorce that threatens her career and a deranged killer newly escaped from prison who vows revenge against her for putting him away. Now would you believe that Brooks&#39; stalker doesn&#39;t want to turn him into the police but rather wants to go along on his next kill? No? Well, would you believe that the serial killer just happens to spot the deranged killer and his tough-as-nails girlfriend at a convenience store so he can set in motion a plan to kill two birds with one stone, so to speak? Clearly, this is one busy story but one that never digs beneath the surface in search of motives or insight. Brooks has an alter ego named Marshall who is personified by William Hurt. Marshall plays Id to Brooks&#39; weak Superego, always urging him to be bad and enjoy the ride. The two discuss murder methods and the care to take so as to avoid getting caught. But they never really debate the merits of badness. The film views the anti-hero&#39;s compulsion as an addiction. Brooks even attends AA meetings. And when his daughter gives in to her bloody impulses, he figures she has inherited his "disease." This is as far as any insight goes. So all the film&#39;s characters, real or imagined, are either twisted or depraved save for the peripheral roles of wife (Marg Helgenberger) and cop sidekick (Ruben Santiago-Hudson). They aren&#39;t allowed to be very bright, though. One day our Mr. Brooks catches a plane for the Bay Area, performs a hatchet murder to cover up his daughter&#39;s tracks, flies back home and crawls into bed next to his wife. She thinks he has been downstairs the whole time playing with his pottery-making. Right. The filmmaking is sleek and meticulous with well-upholstered sets and insistent mood music. It&#39;s all part of that conceit that a trash exploitation movie done with exquisite production values is somehow classy. It&#39;s not. Eden Rock Media/ElementFilms/Relativity Media/Tig Prods.

Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Spector defense targets forensic errors By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent Article Launched: 05/31/2007 03:49:20 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge Defense attorney Christopher Plourd places his pen in his mouth to represent a gun entering a mouth, as he cross-examines Dr. Louis Pena, a deputy medical examiner, during the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector, Wednesday, May 30, 2007, at Los Angeles Superior Court in Los Angeles. Investigators made mistakes in evidence collection and handling in actress Lana Clarkson's shooting death, including the loss of a piece of one of her teeth, Pena conceded Wednesday. LOS ANGELES- A coroner testifying in Phil Spector's murder trial acknowledged there were crime lab mistakes in evidence collection and handling including moving Lana Clarkson's body, which ended up compromising evaluation of at least one item at the crime scene. Dr. Louis Pena also said Wednesday during cross-examination by Spector's defense attorneys that medical findings could not determine who held the gun that fired the bullet that killed the actress. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The defense is seeking to show that Clarkson pulled the trigger of the handgun inserted in her mouth. "Let's get it very basic," defense attorney Christopher Plourd said Wednesday. "You can't tell who was holding the gun." "That's correct," Pena replied. Pena said Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as "pending" until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didn't necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. "There are two ways to look at it," said Pena. "It implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity." On Tuesday, Pena was unequivocal that Clarkson's death was a homicide. He testified there was no evidence Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. He said she had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. He said Wednesday he didn't consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. The medical examiner also said criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarkson's teeth. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coroner's office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarkson's dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised investigators' ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. Pena acknowledged during cross-examination that Clarkson's body was mistakenly moved, causing blood to flow from her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the "Wall of Sound" recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Corman's 1985 cult film "Barbarian Queen." The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

The second sequel in the Walt Disney-made series has already broken box office records in the US for the best Memorial Day weekend debut, after making $142.1m (105.8m).

He was 76. Reilly died Friday in Los Angeles of complications from pneumonia, his partner, Patrick Hughes, told the New York Times. Reilly began his career in New York City, taking acting classes at a studio with Steve McQueen, Geraldine Page and Hal Holbrook. In 1962, he appeared on Broadway as Bud Frump in the original Broadway production of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying. The role won him a Tony Award. He was nominated for a Tony again for playing Cornelius in In 1997 he received another nomination for directing Julie Harris and Charles Durning in a revival of After moving to Hollywood in the 1960s he appeared as the nervous Claymore Gregg on TV's The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and as a featured guest on The Dean Martin Show. He gained fame by becoming what he described as a "game show fixture" in the 1970s and 80s. He was a regular on programs like often wearing giant glasses and loud suits with ascots. His larger-than-life persona and affinity for double-entendres also landed him on the with Johnny Carson more than 95 times. Reilly ruefully admitted his wild game show appearances adversely affected his acting career. "You can't do anything else once you do game shows," he told The Advocate, the national gay magazine, in 2001. "You have no career." His final work was an autobiographical one-man show, Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly, about his family life growing up in the Bronx. The title grew out of the fact that when he would act out as a child, his mother would often admonish him to "save it for the stage." The stage show was made into the 2006 feature film called The Life of Reilly. Reilly's openly gay television persona was ahead of its time, and sometimes stood in his way. He recalled a network executive telling him "they don't let queers on television." Hughes, his only immediate survivor, said Reilly had been ill for more than a year. No memorial plans had been announced. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Dr. Louis Pena also said Wednesday during cross-examination by Spector's defense attorneys that medical findings could not determine who held the gun that fired the bullet that killed the actress. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The defense is seeking to show that Clarkson pulled the trigger of the handgun inserted in her mouth. "Let's get it very basic," defense attorney Christopher Plourd said Wednesday. "You can't tell who was holding the gun." "That's correct," Pena replied. Pena said Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as "pending" until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didn't necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. "There are two ways to look at it," said Pena. "It implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity." On Tuesday, Pena was unequivocal that Clarkson's death was a homicide. He testified there was no evidence Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. He said she had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. He said Wednesday he didn't consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. The medical examiner also said criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarkson's teeth. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coroner's office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarkson's dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised investigators' ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. Pena acknowledged during cross-examination that Clarkson's body was mistakenly moved, causing blood to flow from her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the "Wall of Sound" recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Corman's 1985 cult film "Barbarian Queen." Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The attraction will include thrill rides, specialized foods, experience-based 'textural' features and more. Following is a partial transcript (possibly video later) of the live webcast issued exclusively to fan sites tonight which detailed the announcement: for even larger versions of the artist renderings below.) Hi, I'm Scott Trowbridge, vice president of creative for Universal Studios Theme Parks. We're here in Dumbledore's Office set at Leavesden Studios, a very special place, to make a very special announcement today. over what we're about to share, but because you folks are the dedicated Harry Potter fans, it was important for us to speak with you first and personally about this exciting news. There's a lot happening right now in the world of Harry Potter. The final book is due out this summer, the fifth movie is also coming in July, and we, with our partners at Warner Bros., have been working on a very exciting project of our own. And I'm very excited to tell you folks first that we are adding a new dimension to the world of Harry Potter and bringing it to life in an entirely new way. Stuart Craig (SC), production designer for all the films, is introduced. We actually have over 20 artists and designers working here at Leavesden, who've been working on this project with Stuart and his team, to bring that level of authenticity to bear on this project. We've had other help as well. Steve Kloves, who is the screenwriter for many of the films; David Heyman and David Barron, two of the producers, have been a great support in helping us bring this to life in a truly authentic way. And of course, JK Rowling herself has review our plans from the very beginning and has given us her encouragement and support, has been a great collaborator. Now, this theme park within a park is not just a place. It will be a place to provide an opportunity to experience the magical world of Harry Potter first hand, and offers guests the chance to visit some of the wizarding world's most famous locations. This includes the village of Hogsmeade, the Forbidden Forest, even the crown jewel itself, Hogwarts castle. Authenticity is something that's very important to us. In terms of both the theme park and just the world of Harry Potter in general, why do you think the authenticity and credibility is so important? SC: Well, the philosophy on the movies was to make everything seem as real and credible as possible. We undertook a period of research, and looked at the great European cathedrals, Oxford University in this country. We shot in those places, but we also built sets, and we're sitting in Dumbledore's Office right now, which is a reflection of that. So all of this kind of informed us and helped us to keep the world credible, to keep the detail very real and very specific. That same philosophy was applied to the theme park. What we're talking about here is a fully immersive and engaging environment, with lots of ways to discover this world for yourselves for the first time. SC: The movie people, this team of 20 artists, illustrators, draftsmen and so on, they know how to deliver the details. Universal's expertise is obviously in generating theme parks and being able to manage the enormous numbers of guests and how to make them safe and how to make them enjoy the whole experience. But more than that, I think there's a particular kind of American skill, American virtue. I think theme parks are American, and I think America has a way of just embracing an idea, really going for it, giving everybody enough and then a little bit more -- 110%. That kind of collaboration and our two sets of very different skills are making this work in a very exciting way. ST: What we are collaborating on is coming out to be an incredibly exciting project. Now, of course we're talking about the environment, but that's not all that's part of this world. It will be an amazing, immersive, rich and detail filled environment, but there's also going to be amazing rides and attractions, experience-based shows, shops and restaurants, and we'll be bringing out for the first time ever, a spectacular new attraction that will bring the magic and characters and stories of Harry Potter to life in a way never before experienced, capturing the heart and imagination of all of our guests. SC: I'm scared to death and then I'm enjoying it at the same time. I think even making a movie delivers concerns as well as fulfillment. I'm enjoying our collaboration enormously. There's a lot of challenges. A lot of times on films, we get caught up in what it looks like, what the camera sees, but less so on what does it feel like, what does it smell like, is it hot, is it cold, those kinds of textural things that we'll be providing in the world that we're building. ST: Unfortunately we're not quite ready to give out all the details behind the magic yet. We have a long way to go to finish the design on this project, but we'll be providing more information as we go. SC (on why the story and characters are so powerful): Its reach around the world is phenomenal, and what is really intriguing is that the books and the movies are very very specific in its European culture and British institutions, what we call public schools and what the rest of the world calls private or boarding schools. The manners and the behaviors and so on, very very specifically British. The architectural detail is so geographically specific. So the fact that the world is able to find this accessible and relate to it and get pleasure from reading it is extraordinary, and a tribute to its great great power. The Americanization of world culture, older European cultures often complain about. This is the antithesis of that. This is America embracing a very specific European culture and making it really accessible, taking it to the world. It's enormously powerful, surprisingly so. ST: We try to give people experiences they can't get anywhere else. This world of Harry Potter will be a place where fans can have a real personal encounter with the magical world. You can discover it on your own, and on your own terms. That's really one of the things that Universal really strives to do. This park is going to be at Universal Orlando Resort. Our heritage is in the movies and in creating one-of-a-kind experiences. In Orlando, there are actually two Universal theme parks: there's Universal Studios, which is based on film and television, and right next door is Islands of Adventure, which will become the home of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. At its soul, it's about great stories of literature, great stories of adventure. We feel it's a perfect home for the WWoHP. Islands of Adventure was lucky enough last year to be awarded the Best Theme Park in the World ("applause award"). ST (to SC): What are you looking forward to, when the doors open and you see people coming into the park for the first time? SC: I'm looking forward to being one of them. I want to go there! I want to take my grandchildren. I think this unique collaboration of the theme park world and movie world will be magical and I can't wait to be the first in the gate. ST: The Magical World of Harry Potter is scheduled to open in early 2010. As I said before, we're going to keep you informed as we move ahead. Visit for web and e-mail updates. Q: Will I be able to going inside Hogwarts castle? A: You will, says Stuart. You'll be able to see the exterior of Hogwarts castle and then enter it. It's a magical space, so it's kind of limitless on the insides. But there are certain key elements, very familiar elements, maybe even this environment we're sitting in now, you will indeed be able to go into. Q: What is JK Rowling's involvement? A: JK Rowling has been involved from the very beginning, and I mean from the beginning. We wouldn't be doing any of this if these great, fantastic stories hadn't been born from her imagination. Specifically on the theme park project, she has from the very beginning, reviewed our plans, and been very supportive and excited and encouraging about what we're doing. Q: Shouldn't the theme park be in England? A: (SC) I think Orlando is the focus of theme parks. Everybody's very used to gravitating there, and listen, the climate's much better there. It's perfectly natural. I think it's absolutely appropriate. The bottom line is I think you'll do it better there than we'd do it here anyway. Q: Will the new environment be based on any specific book or film? A: It's intended to encompass the entire world of HP. People are going to be coming to the park at different points in their relationship with the books and the movies, so we want to create a world that feels right no matter where they are in their relationships with the books or films. It's not based on any specific point in time. It's really based more on the DNA of the archetypal Harry Potter book and experience. Q: Has this been held until after book 7 so that it could be built completely, or is the timing of a coincidence? A: The timing is more coincidence than not. We have been working with Warner Bros. and with JK Rowling for a number of years now, and we've actually already been in design for at least a year and a half. We will be taking elements from all of the books, and eventually all of the films. The WWoHP is expected to open just before the last film opens, so we're going to try to take as much material that represents the world and make it a part of this physical embodiment. Q: Are there any thrill rides in the theme park, such as rollercoasters, dedicated to any of the characters? A: Yes, there will be thrill rides, there will be very intense thrill rides, there will be immersive, engaging rides that are filled with story and fantasy, and there will be lots of opportunity for people to get different entertainment experiences that are based on characters. SC: I think it's very important that the theme park represents the entire saga, from book 1 to book 7. It needs to feel complete, and it will feel complete. Q: Can fans contribute ideas to the park? A: Yes, we do want this to be a dialogue with you. There will be an opportunity for us to hear back from you. We won't be able to accommodate and incorporate everybody's ideas, but we do want to hear from people. Q: What age range will the park be aimed at? A: This is Harry Potter. It deals with the magic, but it's not fairie, pixie-dust kind of magic. This is a more mature kind of magic. This is a set of stories that deals with real struggle and good and evil. SC: I'd say it begins around 7 and goes to my age and even up to 67. Q: What steps will be taken to ensure that the park will still feel British even though it is in Florida? A: We are undertaking this project in a way unlike any other project we've taken on before. That includes everything from the way we're building it. We're having it drawn and designed by people with experience not only in Harry Potter but in that British sensibility that Stuart talked about. We're going to continue that thinking all the way through the food that we serve, the merchandise that we sell, the way we train the employees and staff, will all be done with that eye towards authenticity, and an eye towards our commitment to making this world as authentic and incredible and as 'Harry Potter' as it possibly can be. SC on his favorite planned part: We're sitting in one of them, fortunately, and this is one we'd very much like to create within the theme park. There are corners of the Common Room that I like very much, there are aspects of the Dark Arts classroom I like very much, the silhouette of the entire castle. In Hogsmeade, too, we have never shown the complete Hogsmeade in the movies and there's a chance here to do so. I think those new elements the theme park will have that the movies haven't been able to explore, that's exciting too. ST: We think that the Harry Potter world is already a classic. It is a modern classic and will have a life well beyond when the seventh book is printed and when the seventh film is in the can. We're making the commitment to building this place where that world will live on for many, many, many years. We look forward to this being a place where you can bring your family, your grandson, your friends, time and time again, and kind of share it with them. Hopefully it will be a place that will appeal to everyone.

I can imagine myself on my late twenties going to Hogwarts an Hogsmeade XD! Posted May 31, 2007 at 4:20 AM EST This sounds ok, I was a bit concerned at first incase it turned out to be a bit 'tacky' but it seems like it will be done really well - doubt I'll go though because I'm terrified of flying!! :( Posted May 31, 2007 at 4:24 AM EST That is so amazingly cool!

Very dissappointed though that seeing this is an English based film that they can't do something in England. We are just terrible at theme parks but I do think that if they had an HP theme park here thousands would come here to visit. Posted May 31, 2007 at 4:38 AM EST Oh... my..... GOD!! That is so fantastic - if they can pull it off, it would be an amazing theme park. Imagine being able to go into a real Three Broomsticks pub and get a jug of butterbeer..... oh this would be worth the cost to fly to the USA! I hope it's not 'cheesey' - sounds too good to be true. Great report!

Reilly's partner told The New York Times that he died Friday in Los Angeles of complications from pneumonia. Reilly was 76. Reilly won a Tony Award in 1962 for playing Bud Frump in the original Broadway production of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." He gained fame by becoming what he described as a "game show fixture." He was a regular on programs such as "Match Game" and "Hollywood Squares," often wearing giant glasses and colorful suits with ascots. Reilly's larger-than-life persona and affinity for double-entendres also landed him on the "Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson more than 95 times. . All rights reserved.

After writing and directing 2005's and producing Will Ferrell's , the man now has scores of films he's either writing, directing and/or producing coming soon. A recent profile dubbed him the "Mayor of Comedy." It's possible that Apatow is being over-praised, but based on what he's pulled off with , it's getting harder to make that argument. Somehow, a two-hour-and-10-minute comedy with an idea as old as time (loser impregnates a one-night stand and grows up!) has managed to be the funniest film of 2007. Aside from that, he's pulled off some casting coups: He's not only written a large and hilarious part for his real-life wife, Leslie Mann, but he's cast his young daughters, Iris and Maude, in smaller parts&mdash;and hilarious. Hell, he even gets a funny performance out of Ryan Seacrest. The man is good. takes a standard comic premise and makes it both sweet and incredibly dirty. Apatow regular Seth Rogen plays Ben Stone, a pudgy layabout whose lifestyle consists of getting high with his roommates and working on a Web site designed to catalog nude scenes in movies, an idea even conservative audience members will realize has already been done. Ben hooks up with career-oriented entertainment reporter Alison Scott, played by Katherine Heigl (much better here than on TV's ), and a miscommunication about birth control leads to the titular pregnancy. Alison is just as unprepared for a baby as Ben&mdash;her perpetually irate sister (Mann), with whom she lives, met her equally unsatisfied husband ( 's Paul Rudd) under similar circumstances. Meanwhile, her superiors at the television station (Alan Tudyk and Kristen Wiig) have let her know that "We don't want you to lose weight, we just want you to be healthy. By eating less." The film more or less follows the expected formula: Ben and Alison decide, a little too quickly, to be a couple for the sake of the baby, leading to many scenes of arguments, trips to the gynecologist, and a hysterical bit where a swollen, hormone-crazed Alison has trouble finding the right sexual position with a terrified Ben. The story is just self-aware enough to seem slightly embarrassed by how predetermined its beats are, and there are times when it fast-forwards over such bits as Ben finally starting to get it together. That said, the inevitable labor scene has a priceless sight gag that too many trailers and other reviews have spoiled. However, the plot is not as important as the film's relaxed, natural voice and performances. Like Steve Carell in , Rogen becomes an unlikely leading man, and there's fantastic work from all the actors&mdash;Rudd has a hilarious scene involving hotel chairs. Even small roles, such as 's Craig Robinson as a depressed bouncer, make a memorable impression. It's also nice to see Harold Ramis get a good part as Ben's supportive-but-clueless father: He and Rogen have a great, relaxed chemistry. (His few minutes of screen time are funnier than the last three films he's directed.) It looks like we're due for a slew of more films from Apatow and Rogen, starting with the Rogen-scripted teen comedy later this summer, and then next year's , directed by one-time North Carolinian David Gordon Green. As Apatow is producing both films, we may be witnessing the dawn of the Apatow-Rogen age of film comedy. If any of these new films are as funny as , then this will be a fine epoch indeed. &mdash; Kevin Costner, still dancing with wolves after all these years Photo by Ben Glass/ Element Funding Kevin Costner's enduring popularity is a fascinating phenomenon. He is the regular butt of jokes revolving around infamous cinematic duds. Yet, at age 52 he remains a steady, bankable actor who, like Gary Cooper before him, subsists off an earnest everyman accessibility that many find comforting and endearing. No one should ever accuse Costner of being a great thespian, but whether atop a horse or a pitcher's mound, he is always Kevin Costner. Thus the allure of a film like , in which the perennially nice guy actor aims to reveal a dark side, &aacute; la Jimmy Stewart in or Henry Fonda in Once Upon a Time in the West , for example. As the titular Earl Brooks, Costner plays a successful family man so nondescript he owns a box-making factory and reigns as Man of the Year for the Portland (Ore.) Chamber of Commerce. He exudes perpetual calm, even when his daughter (Danielle Panabaker) reveals her withdrawal from college and illegitimate pregnancy, and is so exact he does not employ contractions when he speaks. Brooks also happens to be a pathological serial murderer known as the Thumbprint Killer, who has taken more lives for longer than he can remember or the film bothers to inform. Operating out of a work studio that doubles as a kind of macabre Batcave, Brooks sheds his mild-mannered alter ego and targets random prey for his nocturnal hunts, goaded by an ever-present imaginary devil on his shoulder named Marshall (William Hurt, in full-bloom bravura). Brooks comes off a two-year hiatus to ventilate an attractive dance couple, but a rare slipup results in his illicit secret being uncovered by a daft amateur photographer, referred to only as Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). Smith in turn proposes an unusual blackmail: As consideration for his silence, the two will partner so Brooks can impart killing expertise to his new apprentice. Never does the film realize its delirious intent more than when wallowing in the machinations of Brooks' murderous delectation. In its purest form, , both fables about conformists whose primordial impulses burst their societal moorings in dramatic and disturbing fashion. Brooks' motives are irrelevant and indeed more frightening in their ambiguity. We are not unnerved by the bloodlust as much as the unremarkable, even appealing visage of its vessel, a predator that violates our conditioned demographic biases. It is all the more disheartening, then, that this potentially compelling character study becomes hijacked by some infuriating subplotting. Brooks' predilection suddenly morphs from an addiction he tries to suppress with the help of support groups&mdash;no doubt sans the essential step of admitting his wrongs to others&mdash;into a genetic trait he might have passed to his daughter. And then there is Tracy Atwood, a police detective hot on Brooks' heels, played by Demi Moore with a Lifetime movie-of-the-week countenance. The careers of screenwriting duo Raynold Gideon and Bruce Evans (who also directs) span the good ( ), the bad ( ) and the downright ugly (Tim Allen's ). To their credit, they emerge from a 10-year stint in movie jail with this ambitious concept. But oh, for this material to be in the hands of a director like Christopher Nolan and his skill in atmospheric dissections of fractured psyches. Intriguing yet flawed, deserves better treatment, as does a leading man willing to muss his clean-cut image. But don't cry for Costner&mdash;there is always another cowboy movie just over the horizon. &mdash; It's easy to get cynical about any film involving high school sports. Inspirational sports flicks rarely stray from their cookie-cutter protocols and have become fantastically cheesy and predictable over the years (thank you, ). But director Davis Guggenheim's ( is not a typical high school sports melodrama, even if the flaxen-haired main character kicking a soccer ball on the film's poster makes it seem so. Set in a smoggy 1978 New Jersey landscape, tells the story of a young girl who sets out to play varsity soccer on an all-male team during a time when girls' sports rarely strayed from the arena of cheerleading, ice skating and field hockey. Motivated by the untimely death of her older brother, Gracie defies the odds and proves to her soccer-playing father and brothers that she is indeed tough enough to make the team. After a series of tumultuous 6 a.m. runs, shin-splints, bruises and beat-downs take a toll on her young body, she makes the final cut and joins the ranks of the boys' soccer team. Fortunately, the sports movie clich&eacute;s only make up half of Guggenheim's film. The other half is an insightful drama about family, grief and coming-of-age. Inspired by true events from the lives of the Shue family (actress Elisabeth Shue&mdash;Guggenheim's wife&mdash;acts in and produces the film alongside her brother Andrew), the film's true inspiration blooms from within the strained relationship between Gracie and her grief-stricken father (Dermot Mulroney). As Gracie rebels against her family (her acting out consists of failing history, making out with college boys and smoking cigarettes while listening to Blondie), her father slowly becomes her homing beacon, leading her toward her goal of joining the boys' varsity team by training her both day and night. Although the film veers toward predictable sports sentimentality at times, it is the intimate portrait of a father's acceptance of his daughter that gives emotional force to and its main font of inspiration. &mdash; 0 comments posted for this article There are no comments yet for this story.

The total boxoffice for the 109 films tracked by The Hollywood Reporter was $255.3 million -- marking the biggest weekend in boxoffice history. Early estimates for the weekend overall were slightly higher than what the actual turned out to be as most observers pegged the total for the four-day frame nearer the $265 million level. The new boxoffice benchmark was a mild 2% higher than the industry's previous biggest-grossing session of $249.3 million, which occurred during a rare five-day post-Christmas/New Year's weekend running from Dec. 28, 2001-Jan. 1, 2002, when the holiday fell on a Tuesday. New Line Cinema's "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring" was the top film with $57 million. The next-largest weekend was the four-day Memorial Day session in 2004 with $247.6 million, when "Shrek 2" topped the charts with $95.6 million and 20th Century Fox's "The Day After Tomorrow" debuted with $85.8 million in second place. This year's holiday weekend gross was up 6% from last year's Memorial Day tally of $241.8 million. As expected, by weekend's end, "At World's End" was sitting in the top spot at the boxoffice in North America, making port with a four-day holiday gross of $139.8 million. Including the $13.2 million from Thursday night previews that began at 8 p.m., the total to date for the latest "Pirates" yarn from the Walt Disney Co. is a massive $153 million. The opening weekend for the Johnny Depp starrer will go down as the second-biggest opening weekend of all time, behind the $151.1 million bow of "Spider-Man 3" and ahead of the $135.6 million debut of "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest." Both "Spider-Man 3" and the "Dead Man's Chest" opened during a nonholiday three-day weekend. Director Gore Verbinski, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and writers Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott worked on all three "Pirates" films in the same capacity. The PG-13 adventure, co-starring Keira Knightley, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush, opened in a record 4,362 venues and should hold up pretty nicely in the weeks ahead if exit polls are any indication. According to CinemaScore, a sterling 90% of those polled gave "At World's End" a positive score. The high seas-set picture hit all four quadrants in the demographic world -- which is every film's dream demo -- and the percentage comparison between the quadrants was divided fairly evenly. The combined high score and wide demo reach should give "At World's End" some legs at the boxoffice. "Shrek the Third" was in the second spot with $67 million from 4,172 locations. The not-so-jolly green ogre held up well in its sophomore frame and has collected a stout $217.4 million in 11 days. The PG comedy has the animated audience pretty much to itself for at least one more weekend, and then Sony's CG-animated "Surf's Up" hits theaters June 8. "Spider-Man 3" took in $18.1 million to snag the third slot in its fourth weekend in theaters. The Tobey Maguire starrer is still swinging strongly at the boxoffice, generating a noteworthy $307.8 million during its first 25 days in release. Lionsgate's "Bug" was the weekend's only other wide release. In a counterprogramming move, the R-rated thriller debuted in 1,661 locales and placed fourth with a $4 million gross, averaging a weak $2,408 per theater. William Friedkin directed "Bug," based on the off-Broadway play by Tracy Letts. Word-of-mouth doesn't seem likely to help this picture in the weeks ahead as the film was rated favorably in exit polls by a dismal 19% of moviegoers, according to CinemaScore. A bright spot among limited releases was Fox Searchlight's "Waitress," which jumped into the fifth slot with $4 million. The comedy was in 501 theaters, up 394 from the previous weekend, and averaged $7,984 per theater. Its cume stands at $6.5 million.

LOS ANGELES - A coroner testifying in Phil Spectorâs murder trial acknowledged there were crime lab mistakes in evidence collection and handling including moving Lana Clarksonâs body, which ended up compromising evaluation of at least one item at the crime scene. Dr. Louis Pena also said Wednesday during cross-examination by Spectorâs defense attorneys that medical findings could not determine who held the gun that fired the bullet that killed the actress. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The defense is seeking to show that Clarkson pulled the trigger of the handgun inserted in her mouth. âLetâs get it very basic,â defense attorney Christopher Plourd said Wednesday. âYou canât tell who was holding the gun.â Robyn Beck / AP Dr. Louis Pena, a deputy medical examiner, testifies during cross-examination in the Spector murder trial. âThatâs correct,â Pena replied. Pena said Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as âpendingâ until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didnât necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. âThere are two ways to look at it,â said Pena. âIt implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity.â On Tuesday, Pena was unequivocal that Clarksonâs death was a homicide. He testified there was no evidence Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. He said she had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. He said Wednesday he didnât consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. The week in celebrity sightings Fergie does New York, a new âIdolâ is crowned, âOceanâs 13â comes to Cannes, and more. The medical examiner also said criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarksonâs teeth. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coronerâs office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarksonâs dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised investigatorsâ ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. Click for related content Coroner says it was homicide Criminalist Leeâs credibility under attack Pena acknowledged during cross-examination that Clarksonâs body was mistakenly moved, causing blood to flow from her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the âWall of Soundâ recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Cormanâs 1985 cult film âBarbarian Queen.â Â© 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

BY: Actress Archives | Wednesday, May 30, 2007 making headlines for her car crash in Los Angeles over the Memorial Day weekend, one of Hollywood's worst-kept secrets may be headed under the microscope. Underage movie stars seem to have no problems making the rounds at trendy nightclubs on the SunsetStrip and Hollywood Boulevard, but are they being served alcohol? More to the point, after was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, was served alcohol illegally before her now-infamous car crash? The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has placed investigators in various nightclubs to try and determine the answer to that question. In the case of , the paparazzi has video showing Lohan leaving the Les Deux Hollywood nightclub at around 3:30am before she crashed her car. In the state of California, the legal drinking age is 21 and alcohol cannot be served after 2 a.m. However, Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore told the had dinner and was not drinking. A statement quoted by the Because of the enormous paparazzi presence outside of Les Deux that night, we allowed her to stay late and wait for her friends. , the 20-year-old star who turns legal age on July 2, was driving her Mercedes-Benz convertible when she hit a curb and crashed into a shrub on Sunset Boulevard. was taken to a nearby hospital in a private car, while the two other passengers in the Mercedes were not hurt. Police later said that they found " a usable amount of cocaine " in the car, and later arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. Since then, a publicist for has said the actress has entered the Promises rehab facility, the same one which recently attended, on Monday. John Carr, a spokesperson for the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) told the We have a duty to check on these things whenever there's a report of a minor involved in a crash. " Carr also noted that " underage drinking is a huge problem in the state of California. " To support that claim, some statistics claim that 1,574 people were killed in alcohol-related vehicle crashes in 2006, with roughly 200 involved in underage drinking. But the question still remains: Are underage celebrities getting a free pass to drink in Hollywood? Last year, the paparazzi were on the scene at the Mood night club, where various underage stars were seen. Along with and Jesse McCartney were all seen at the nightclub, and all were underage at the time. One photograph showed Jesse McCartney, who was 18 at the time, drinking from a Corona bottle at Mood. However, John Carr told the that, ",eM>We can't prove what's in the glass or where they were. We need a witness on the ground. " The ABC is currently seeking a 15-closure of Mood based on an undercover investigation. John Carr did say that there is no current investigation into Les Deux following the car crash involving , but he did tell the We do investigate any time we get complaints when someone underage is being served. Anyone under the age of 21 cannot be sold alcohol in California.

PHOTOS: Ms. USA Booed, Falls at Pageant PHOTOS: Beauty Queens Play Dress Up The boos started as soon as Smith stepped forward for the interview round. And it continued, along with chants of "Mexico," as Smith launched into a history of her volunteer work in South Africa. "I don't think they are booing because of Rachel," said Donald Trump, co-owner of the Miss Universe pageant. "They are booing because of the immigration policy." The tensions were evident in 2004 and '05, when Mexicans booed during the national anthem at a soccer game against the United States, some even chanting "Osama." Resentment has grown since then, as the United States sent the National Guard to help beef up border security and build a wall to keep immigrants out. Many Mexicans are also anxious about the new immigration bill which they fear would split Mexican parents from their American-born children. "People in Mexico get a flavor of that debate and it's irking them, and I think what occurred is indicative of what happened in the manner and tone of Congress in the debate," said Nativo Lopez, president of the Mexican American Political Association. Some Mexicans feel that the United States uses its power to get its way in world politics and also in competitions such as the Miss Universe pageant, Lopez said. They were upset that Miss Mexico didn't make it to the final five and Miss USA did, even though she slipped and fell during the evening gown competition. Smith has not commented on the story. It was a tough night overall for Miss USA: She failed to capture the crown after falling. However, Smith is being credited for grace under fire during the boos, which she managed to partly turn into cheers by addressing the crowd in Spanish.

He said the animal measured more than 9 feet from tail to snout. The story immediately was met with skepticism. Jamison said he bagged the boar on a hunting preserve in eastern Alabama. The publicity prompted his father, Mike Stone, to create a Web site that features photos of the boy and his trophy, dubbed Monster Pig. It's also earned Jamison a bit part in an upcoming film "The Legend of Hogzilla," based on the tale of a superpig gunned down in Georgia in 2004. Hog Hoax: 1000 Pound Monster Pig 'Hogzilla 2' Skull Revealed by Boy With fame, however, comes criticism. The Stones have been accused of everything from doctoring photos to make the pig look bigger to unnecessarily torturing an animal. "We've gotten a lot of negative e-mail," Mike Stone told ABC News.com. "People have said they want to see my boy killed in a hunting accident and gutted like a pig." Now he has the swine's skull and some backup from a taxidermist. "Jerry (Cunningham), the taxidermist, brought me this bleached skull of my hog and this is a 1,051-pound hog skull and that's a ... 250-pound hog skull," the boy said, pointing to the skull of a smaller animal, placed next to his monster's hog for comparison. Cunningham agreed with Jamison on the size of the boar. "I actually skinned this pig out," Cunningham said. "And I know it was a 1,000-pound hog. It was that big. No doubt." Skull photos are here. Don't expect them to quiet the skepticism. The skull looks way smaller than the massive head in the photos.

YOU MIGHT HAVE TO SEE Knocked Up more than once, just so as not to miss any of the priceless jokes. The writer and director, Judd Apatow, whose string of television cult favorites included The Larry Sanders Show and Freaks and Geeks, has a remarkable flair for dirty frat-boy banter and sardonic one-liners. As in his 2005 film directing debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, the plot of Knocked Up is merely a peg for a Gatling-gun barrage of wisecracks. Knocked Up reprises the profane sensibility and much of the cast of 40-Year-Old Virgin. Seth Rogan, a sidekick in Virgin, plays a stoned slacker named, appropriately, Ben Stone, who stumbles into a drunken one-night stand with statuesque blonde Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl), an aspiring E! Entertainment TV correspondent. Alison, a bit of a slacker herself, lives with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann, Apatow&#39;s wife), her feckless husband Pete (Paul Rudd) and their two little girls. In their inebriated sexual frenzy, the couple forgets birth control, and Alison soon discovers she&#39;s pregnant. In the cold light of day, Alison realizes Ben was one of those "how drunk was I?" one-night stands: paunchy and puerile, he lives with his stoner buddies in a messy, bong-hazy house with neon beer-sign d&eacute;cor. He&#39;s an impossibly bad candidate for a relationship, let alone fatherhood. He&#39;s never held a job, and lives off a settlement he got when a mail truck ran over his foot in his native Canada. Ben and his friends insist they are working: They&#39;re building a Web site that will direct users to the "boobs and bush" scenes in DVD movies, dumbly unaware that the Mr. Skin Web site already performs this important service. So much for the business plan! The story is told from Alison&#39;s and Ben&#39;s perspectives, with a surprising measure of sympathy. For a movie as savagely jokey as this, the writing has unexpected depth and shading. Alison, after taking dozens of pregnancy tests hoping for a different outcome, decides to have the baby, then has to hide her growing girth (and occasional on-air morning sickness) from her appearance-obsessed bosses. Despite Ben&#39;s unsuitability, Alison decides they should try to make the relationship work, with predictably rocky results. Yet there is hope, because beneath his lazy, immature exterior, Ben is actually a pretty nice guy. Rogan&#39;s comedic talent enables him to find the balance between repulsiveness and likeability. He also has a wonderful way with a one-liner; the quips roll out of his mouth with exquisite timing. When Ben&#39;s dad, played by an uncredited Harold Ramis, tells Ben he&#39;s the best thing that ever happened to him, Ben thinks a moment and says, "Now I just feel bad for you." Alison relies on the advice of her sister, who has troubles of her own with a husband who refuses to grow up. Pete makes Ben his confidant, sharing with him his dark thoughts about family life &mdash; his fear that he will never be as happy as his little daughters are at play. Rudd and Mann are terrifically funny as the couple in crisis. Like the Steve Carrell character in Virgin, Ben receives lots of useless advice from his buddies. When one housemate declares abortion a sin, another concocts a mock euphemism: "Okay, rhymes with shmashmorshun." There are more memorable jokes in this movie than in Virgin (which Apatow co-wrote with Carrell), and more, in fact, than in any recent movie I can think of. The movie is longer than it needs to be, and at times loses its way in gynecological slapstick, gross humor and unfortunate baby-related sentimentality. But unless you are offended by vulgar jokes and explicit sexual humor, it&#39;s easy enough to ignore the flaws and just laugh. &copy; 2007 The Cleveland Free Times: 800 W.

The total value of the deal is $400 million, including $370 million in cash and debt of $30 million, according to a source familiar with the talks. Famous Music's catalogue of over 125,000 songs and sound cues includes music by Eminem and Shakira as well as movie soundtracks from Famous was founded originally as a unit to publish songs from movies. The deal is the first major move by recently appointed SonyATV Chief Executive Martin Bandier, the former head of EMI Music Publishing who left EMI earlier this year. As part of the deal, SonyATV will be entering the production music business through the Famous Extreme division. SonyATV is jointly owned by Sony and pop star Michael Jackson. Its catalogue includes songs by The Beatles, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix. "The depth and breadth of the catalogue is what truly makes it great," said Bandier. Music publishing has become one of the more coveted segments of the music industry as recorded music has been severely hit by piracy and the transition from physical sales to digital music files. Publishing is less vulnerable to the vagaries of music retailing as it generates revenue by licensing songs to a variety of sources, including television, advertising, radio and live performance. Earlier this month, French media giant Vivendi's Universal Music Publishing Group unit became the world's largest music publisher after it bought BMG Music Publishing in a $2.19 billion deal. Other music companies have also said they intend to expand their publishing catalogues.

Add to My AOL Silver Surfer Quarters Are Not Legal Currency Posted May 29th 2007 4:33PM by It seems I no longer need to worry -- or rant -- about the American government selling itself out for ad space. The Silver Surfer quarters that I on Friday were not actually made with any cooperation from the U.S. Mint*. In fact, a press release from the Mint states the coins are "in no way approved, authorized, endorsed or sponsored by the United States Mint, nor is [the movie promotion] associated or affiliated with the United States Mint." According to a spokesperson from 20th Century Fox, neither the studio nor the Franklin Mint meant to imply the U.S. Mint was involved, and certainly neither meant to break the law. But the marketing stunt may in fact be in violation, because it is illegal to turn federal money into an advertisement. This appears to be exactly what Fox and Franklin have done, since the 40,000 Silver Surfer coins are modified versions of actual U.S. quarters originally minted and circulated by the government in 2005. It is hard to understand exactly how Fox and Franklin think the promotion, which advertises the website for the movie Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer , did not imply the coins are real, legal tender. Though the Franklin Mint often produces collectible and commemorative coins, it does not usually distribute them for free by dumping them into circulation. The Silver Surfer quarters were sent into the currency stream last week and all are expected to be in circulation by the end of the Memorial Day weekend. If neither Fox nor Franklin means for them to be accepted as real money, then how are they to be distributed? So far neither company has been issued a fine or other legal ramification, but we'll see if something more happens with the story once the business week begins. *Thanks to commenter Alex C. for tipping me off about the follow-up story.

If I'm not mistaken, it's still legal tender. The Franklin Mint just painted the image of the Silver Surfer over the back of existing 2005 California state quarters. It's defaced legal tender, but it's still legal tender. I think. on May 29th 2007 by Fred Philbie 2. I guess you are correct, Fred. I can't find anything stating if defacement of currency makes it no longer legal tender. I did find the law regarding defacement as a crime, however: Defacement of currency is a violation of Title 18, Section 333 of the United States Code. Under this provision, currency defacement is generally defined as follows: Whoever mutilates, cuts, disfigures, perforates, unites or cements together, or does any other thing to any bank bill, draft, note, or other evidence of debt issued by any national banking association, Federal Reserve Bank, or Federal Reserve System, with intent to render such item(s) unfit to be reissued, shall be fined not more than $100 or imprisoned not more than six months, or both. on May 29th 2007 by Christopher Campbell Please keep your comments relevant to this blog entry.

Griffin offers explanation for Rosie departure BY: Actress Archives | Monday, May 28, 2007 Kathy Griffin, a close friend of , has come forward to reveal why the host of The View has officially left the show and won't be completing the final three weeks of her contract. Yes, it does have to do with 's on-screen fight with , but that's only half the story. According to Kathy Griffin, as reported by People magazine, her friend was furious that the producers of The View decided to turn her honest disagreement with into something sensational by split-screening the two hosts of The View during their fight. Kathy Griffin tells the magazine that she spoke to right after the announcement from ABC Television that she wouldn't be returning to The View, " I said, 'What was it really?' 'The split-screen. I don't want to do "Hannity and Colmes."' Kathy Griffin has filled in twice for in the past few weeks and spoke about the departure of her friend to a sold out crowd at the Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. According to TMZ, Kathy Griffin also claimed that doesn't even feel that much hatred for heard that Donald Trump had called "stupid," she apparently expressed sadness. According to Kathy Griffin, " She doesn't even hate Elisabeth. It all started on Wednesday when , two hosts of The View who have never seen eye to eye, got into their most protracted and intense fight in the history of the show in front of the world. The fight was started because of the differing opinions of the war in Iraq between , but the two very different hosts have feuded really since Rosie got to the program. It got ugly on Wednesday's edition of The View, when expressed the opinion that " the enemy is in Iraq. then jumped into the fray as she pointed out, " You just said our enemy is in Iraq...Did Iraq attack us? " As the heated exchange went on, The View producers split the screen with one side focusing on and the other zoomed in on , who is married to New York Giants back-up quarterback Tim Hasselbeck and is the sister-in-law of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, used a football analogy to explain her point of view. " If you're playing a game and I say I'm throwing to my receiver wide right, okay what does that do for your enemy Rosie? " Rosie shot back, " Well Elisabeth, if the enemy are innocent civilians, I don't want to play that kind of football. It got worse from there with Joy Behar trying to settle down and the controversial host clearly becoming exasperated with the whole situation. Referring to how much time she had left on the program, That's why I'm not going to right with you anymore because it's absurd, so for three weeks you can say all the Republican crap you want. It wasn't over, even as Sherri Shepherd tried to cut to commercial and Joy Behar tried to calm , who shouted out, " I asked you if you believe what the Republican pundits were saying. You said nothing and that was cowardly. wasn't happy at all with that, saying, " Dont call me a coward. I sit here every day and open my heart and tell people exactly what I believe...It was not cowardly. It was honest...asking a rhetorical question? That is cowardly. I need a drink of water, lets go to commercial. The View needs hosts. With gone for good and about to go on maternity leave, the program, which is more popular than ever, is going to have to find interesting characters to replace them. As of right now, Joy Behar is the only person officially coming back to The View. was only on The View for less than a year, but it helped the show by getting it all kinds of new press from the host's high profile fights with Donald Trump and to her comments on the Catholic Church and the attacks of 9/11. Whatever people think of , she will be tough to replace on The View. Elisabeth Hasselbeck in the News Are Rosie and Hasselbeck speaking again?

Gay Vote: Best of Broadway: Musical Trivia quiz: Broadway broads Trivia quiz: Best Broadway quotes Trivia quiz: Broadway musicals An interview with the puppets from "Avenue Q" by Alonso Duralde, The Advocate Tony Award-winning actor and television personality Charles Nelson Reilly died May 25, 2007 , at the age of 76. In this October 9, 2001 interview, the pop culture oddball and theater director opens up to The Advocate. The name Charles Nelson Reilly may inspire eye-rolling over memories of the poncy, pipe-smoking '70s game-show guest -- but he may well be one of pop culture's most misunderstood figures. After all, Reilly is considered by many -- including his close friends Julie Harris and Roberta Peters -- to be one of his generation's best theater directors. He won a Tony award in 1962 for originating the role of Bud Frump in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." His students have included Lily Tomlin, Bette Midler, and, currently, opera sensation Rodney Gilfry. And, one might argue, his television ubiquity as a flamboyantly gay man in the supermacho '70s counts as a quiet form of revolution. "Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis are activists; they're the first ones to march down the street," says Reilly in the dining room of the plant- and memorabilia-filled Beverly Hills home he shares with his partner, Patrick Hughes. "But I'm more like Marian Anderson, who was a great singer and never said a word about the fact that she was black -- but [being] a black woman in a gorgeous gown and very good jewelry, accompanied by a man on a Steinway in Carnegie Hall, was her way of doing it." Reilly's way of doing it brings him to his latest work, "Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly," which opens off-Broadway at New York's Irish Repertory Theatre on October 7 following several successful regional runs, with an eye toward Broadway. It's an interesting journey back for the 70-year-old actor-director, a staple of such musicals as "Bye Bye Birdie" (he understudied for Gene Rayburn, who would later play straight man as Reilly unleashed his comic barbs on "Match Game"), "Skyscraper," "Hello, Dolly!" and "How to Succeed." Reilly says he left musical theater "because the plays were directed by Gower Champion, Michael Kidd and Michael Bennett -- and they were very wonderful, but they all were boy dancers who went to being choreographers who went to being directors. So you say one line like 'There she goes,' and then [there are] 12 minutes of a big number. I had a big speech by Thornton Wilder in 'Dolly,' and we were in dress rehearsals and I start the speech, and I got two or three lines out and, 'OK, that's all! Stop!' Miss [Carol] Channing could make the costume change in three lines, so they didn't need the rest. I got tired of being a Rockette; I went to Hollywood." In Hollywood, Reilly made a name for himself as the devious Claymore Gregg on the TV version of "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" -- the character had been scripted only for the pilot, but Reilly was such a hit that he became a regular -- and as part of the comic relief on "Dean Martin Presents the Golddiggers." Gen Xers remember him camping it up on Saturday mornings on Sid and Marty Krofft's surrealistic pillow "Lidsville" and on the short-lived, ahead-of-its-time "Uncle Croc's Block" (a show so barely remembered that even Reilly gives me an odd look when I bring it up). But the appearances that seared him into the public consciousness came on game shows, particularly "Match Game '73," "'74," "'75," et al. His banter with perpetual co-panelist Brett Somers gave the show a last-call-at-the-Algonquin feel, and Rayburn could always get Reilly to lower his voice to a butch register by calling him "Chuck." That part of his career, according to Reilly, has been something of a hindrance in television. "You can't do anything else once you do game shows," he notes. "You have no career." Of course, Reilly has had the "no career" that most actors would kill for: Playing novelist Jose Chung on Chris Carter's The "X-Files" and "Millennium," he racked up an Emmy nomination in 1998 for the latter show (although the actor is still miffed that the character got killed off) and another for a 1999 appearance on "The Drew Carey Show." And his volume of work as a theater director is nothing short of astounding -- in fact, it almost appears that Reilly is doing a one-man show of his own life simply because he's already done everyone else's. "I've done Emily Dickinson ["The Belle of Amherst"] and Oscar Levant and Paul Robeson ... I did one with Richard Basehart as Patton," says Reilly. "And Ruby Dee said the words that made me want to do it: 'While you're still perpendicular.'" "Save It for the Stage" goes back to the actor's childhood in the '30s, when he was being raised by a difficult -- to say the very least -- mother and already exhibiting the qualities by which he would become known later in life. "Here comes Mary," Reilly recalls the neighborhood kids yelling when it was his turn at bat in stickball. The show follows his lifelong love of show business, the close friends he's made along the way ("Miss Harris" and Burt Reynolds are probably mentioned the most), and amazing stories, like that of the NBC president who told a young Reilly that there could be "no queers on television" -- only to be found dead years later, murdered by a male prostitute. "I never made my sexual orientation a part of my life," says Reilly. "It didn't matter. I think so many people make it overly important, and I think that's when they get in trouble. That wonderful Toni Morrison, who I think is so brilliant, she helps me every time she talks on television. They used to call her Â¿nigger' and spit on her, and she felt sorry for them. She said they have no morality. When that man told me they don't allow queers on television, I felt sorry for him. I don't know how I knew that." Today, he seems very happy with Hughes, his partner of 20 years. "He's my life," says Reilly. "And we courted for 20 minutes. He worked for a game show called Battlestars, and he was the producer's associate, so he would help the celebrities to their dressing room. The smile was the thing -- his laugh. I love Patrick, and Patrick and I are completely different. We have never had a fight or raised voices. We should not be together, because we have nothing in common. Absolutely nothing, but Â¿ I wouldn't be alive if it wasn't for him. He is extraordinary. He has 800 plants, hanging here, hanging there. And he does it 10 minutes a week; it's kind of strange. But that's Patrick." And while his home life is stable, Reilly finds that "Save It for the Stage" (which he developed with "Time Flies When You're Alive" creator Paul Linke) is always changing. "It's strange -- nightclub slash legitimate theater slash platform piece," he says. "I don't know what it is. It's sort of telling us what it is." But for the natural-born storyteller, performing the play isn't that far removed from his daily life. "I tell the stories all the time," he says. "I go out to dinner, and I'm always with six people, and nobody speaks. So I'll start with a story. Actually, doing the play for two hours is easier than being out, because Ilb talking anyway. At least I get paid for it." Letter to the Editor &copy; 1995-2007 PlanetOut Inc | Save name and password

On his second day as prosecution witness, Deputy Coroner Louis Pena reasserted the jury that the death was a homicide. When cross questioned by defense lawyer, Pena reaffirmed that presence of gun residue on the victimâs hand does not necessarily mean that she shot herself. He even explained how gun residue could drop on a person when heâs being shot by somebody, by putting his hands around his face and chest. "There are two ways to look at it. It implies the person could have been holding the weapon or been in the vicinity when the weapon was discharged," Pena said. He also told the defense lawyer that even the person who has the gun in hand may not have traces of gun powder after the shot. The prosecution witness disclosed that after examining Clarksonâs body he discovered bruises on her tongue, her right arm and hand which brings out a possibility that she was being threatened with a gun in her mouth and was under the pressure of her murderer. When cross questioned by the defense lawyer about the possibility of the presence of the bruise on the tongue due to the gunshot, the doctor answered that such occurrence was ânot normally seenâ. He also added that there was no way to confirm how fresh the bruises were considering the fact that Lana took a lot of pain medications. He also said that while collecting evidence they found large amount of Clarksonâs blood in the left pocket of Spectorâs pants which suggests that the gun had been placed in the pocket and was also wiped. Being asked to analyze the entire situation, Pena disclosed that he had a different picture of Clarkson in mind. All that he could gather from various sources about her is that she was a hopeful person and had no records of suicide attempts or depression. He also added that a suicide with purse on one shoulder at a strangerâs place was a rare possibility and it is a simple case of murder. "It bothered me a lot that she had her purse on her right shoulder," Pena said yesterday. "It's difficult for someone to take a weapon and shoot herself with the purse staying on her shoulder. It should be off." Defense attorney Christopher Plourd also asked him if there was a possibility that the handbag stayed on her shoulder due to a self inflicted wound. Pena confirmed the possibility but added that the circumstantial and physical analysis made him reach the conclusion that the death was a homicide. The defense attorney tried to shoot down the witnesses stand by saying that it was only once in the court that the forensic expert mentioned the significance of the purse and it was not mentioned anywhere in his reports or notes to which the doctor agreed but insisted that he mentioned it in a meeting once before. When asked about any mistakes that Penaâs team made during the investigation, he answered that one of his dental investigators lost one of Clarksonâs teeth which was kept in a vial. Pena was given a taped vial, which seemed to have been assembled after breakage and wasnât told about the incident for several months. "There were three vials collected to be examined by the odontologist," Pena said. "What happened is on review in meeting with the odontologist he admitted he broke one of the vials and the tooth fragment was lost. It flew around the room somewhere." He also told the jury that the dental investigator sealed the vial again but the fragment was never found. He also conceded that Clarksonâs body was moved in a wrong manner which caused blood to flow out of her mouth making it difficult to evaluate her dress for blood spatter. Forensic expert Henry Lee, was also under the doubt umbrella as a retired sheriff's investigator who worked for Spector's initial attorney told the court he saw Lee hold a piece of fingernail in a handkerchief at the time of inspection of the scene in an earlier hearing. The prosecutor confirmed the incident by showing the jury a photograph of the actressâs bloodstained right hand, which showed that part of her acrylic thumbnail was missing. According to prosecution this finding directly pointed towards a rift that must have happened between Spector and Lana before the killing. They also hinted that the defense hid the evidence to save their case. The defense lawyer cross questioned the doctor all morning and also asked a lot of questions on defense experts Vincent DiMaio and Werner Spitz, whose textbook Pena was consulting during the investigation. The testimony will resume tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Harvey Phillip Spector, 67, is accused of shooting actress Lana Clarkson, 40, through the mouth on 03 February 2003 early morning in his mansion. Spector who is presently free on $1-million bail, on the other hand claims that Lana committed suicide. Spector, 67, the American musician songwriter and record producer will face 15 years of life imprisonment if convicted of murder. Actress Lana Clarkson was famous for her notable performance in the movie Barbarian Queen. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Rapper Taboo Pleads... &raquo; Officials Investigate if Lohan Was Served Drinks Illegally California officials are investigating whether there is any evidence Lindsay Lohan was illegally served alcohol before she was arrested for driving under the influence on Saturday. The 20-year-old, who police picked up after she crashed her Mercedes in Beverly Hills, is under the state's legal drinking age of 21. Before her accident, Lohan was spotted partying at the West Hollywood nightclub Les Deux. TMZ.com claims to have video footage of the actress leaving the venue at around 3:30 am on Saturday morning -- an hour and a half after closing time. John Carr, a spokesperson for California's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, has confirmed his agency is investigating whether there is evidence Lohan and other youths were served alcohol illegally, and whether they were served drinks after hours. Les Deux has issued the following statement: "We have and will continue to work closely with the ABC to make sure alcohol is consumed by responsible people of the legal drinking age, in a responsible manner. "Les Deux is a restaurant and there is no age limit for our patrons. Lindsay had dinner at Les Deux that night and waited for friends to pack up the DJ supplies, thus leaving Les Deux after closing. "Because of the enormous paparazzi presence outside of Les Deux that night, we allowed her to stay late and wait for her friends. She was not drinking at Les Deux, and left driven by her driver." Lohan checked into the Promises clinic in Malibu on Monday. Earlier this year, she received treatment at the Wonderland Center rehab facility in Hollywood. DUH - she and others have been alowed in and to drink forever! The law is just as guilty as the clubs for not upholding the law! Posted By: SoozeeQ | May 30 2007 at 03:03 PM That's what I'm thinking too. NOW you want to find out where this minor has been getting wasted? Posted By: Cranky_Old_Batt | May 30 2007 at 03:09 PM Guess she'll have to migrate to Vegas like Britney - or try Tijuana between trips to rehab. Posted By: itsaspork | May 30 2007 at 03:15 PM If she left driven by her driver, how did she crash the car? Or was that a different incident of all-night partying? Posted By: hawaiian | May 30 2007 at 03:19 PM I wonder how long until the spin doctors blame Blowhans behavior on these clubs. Posted By: Good_Karma | May 30 2007 at 03:19 PM If they served her directly I can see the problem. But in an all ages club/restaurant, is the establishment liable if patrons who are of age buy alcohol and THEY then furnish it to minors? Posted By: FrankCostanza | May 30 2007 at 03:23 PM Was she served drinks illegally? Posted By: trait | May 30 2007 at 03:26 PM I agree with you guys on this one. What took them so long to investigate the clubs that serve this girl? Hey Lindsay, when I was underage and going to college in Milwaukee, WI, I could go drinking at ANY bar there was. They never check in Milw. It's BREW TOWN for Godsakes! You can go there for the next few days until your 21st b-day. Posted By: DirtySanchez | May 30 2007 at 03:27 PM Would love to know what her blood alcohol level was! Posted By: LizardofOz | May 30 2007 at 03:35 PM I am shocked that she may have been served drinks illegally. I now have to take to my bed to recover. Posted By: snarkygirl | May 30 2007 at 03:36 PM These places want the attention of these worthless divas so does that mean that they have to go to rehab too? Posted By: nettie67 | May 30 2007 at 03:45 PM I wonder what all this PR can do for Les Idiots. Posted By: itsaspork | May 30 2007 at 03:53 PM This is really a non-issue...Lindsay Loser is a grown woman...everybody needs to stop "babying" her...she made these choices...if she can get "illegal" drugs...who the hell is gonna stop her from getting some liquor if she wants it?...let's "stop" all this bullsh!t...stop pointing the finger at everyone except the one u all need to be pointing the finger at...Lindsay Loser...ain't no need to he harrasing these business establishments...this investigation is a copout...deal with the "real" problem...Lindsay Lohan!!! Posted By: bmorejake | May 30 2007 at 04:16 PM If I was ARNOLD, and want to live in the White House someday, I would be all over this, like a tramp on her good intentions!! Posted By: tigerz | May 30 2007 at 04:17 PM ok I was drinkin @ 18 at the finer SF establishments example: Savoy Tivoli, Gold Mirror, Philly's Club (west portal), Danny's (RIP), Miraloma Club, Portal, TK's, Shannon Arms, GPS (Glen Park Station), Eagle's Drift, Peaks, Yancy's, of course Noe's, Abby Tavern, and Ireland 32's (when there was a line to get in..) ha I have also hit the LA cat n' fiddle, Wall st to name a few..... Posted By: xbbgun | May 30 2007 at 04:36 PM What a relief to hear law enforcement is ON it! Years after Drew Barrymore was partying at the age of 6. Posted By: blasphemusrumrs | May 30 2007 at 04:43 PM it's about friggin' time, and i ask again, what is MADD doing about this? Or is MADD too scared to step on the wrong toes by demonstrating outside of Les Deux, or any of these hoity-toity clubs? Another thing, have they determined what the drug that wasn't "found on her person" is yet, or have they swept that under the rug? Posted By: azdog1 | May 30 2007 at 05:43 PM Oh my xbbgun, you are bringing me back. I used to frequent Gold Mirror, Shannon Arms, Eagle's Drift, Yancy's and Ireland 32's quite a bit. I'll never forget my years in the Mission where my roomate and I did what we called "The Triangle" nearly every night for a year. We went to The Albion and then on to the Kilowatt and finally we would stumble to the 500 Club. Those were the days. Are those bars still there? Posted By: DirtySanchez | May 30 2007 at 05:47 PM It's not like everyone on the planet doesn't know she's under age. Posted By: Redbull | May 30 2007 at 06:11 PM It's the clubs, the producers, directors, her friends, her family...everyone is at fault but Lohan. Posted By: lil_night_owl | May 30 2007 at 06:19 PM I never got carded when I was in high school and before I turned 21, going to Savoy Tivoli etc (fun times). The difference is that it wasn't all over the papers that my 21st birthday was coming up and I don't think the bartenders had any reason to card me. Lindsay is a slightly different story - they really can't plead ignorance of who she is and how old she is. Posted By: madhousewife | May 30 2007 at 06:27 PM Of course she was served illegally, she admitted as much a few weeks back when she said she couldn't wait for her 21st so that she didn't have to put the clubs in an awkward position because she was underage. However, I agree bmorejake, we can't just blame the clubs 'cos the little hussy will find a way to get what she wants. It just disgusts me that this slapper is unfortunately a role model for young girls. I know she shouldn't be but try finding a teenage girl who hasn't heard of Lindsay Lohan.... She is showing young girls who think she's all that, that drinking, taking drugs, driving drunk and recklessly, sleeping with anything with three legs, and smoking is a cool way to behave. I just cannot express my distaste for her strongly enough.... Posted By: Kazzer | May 30 2007 at 07:23 PM Albion is now called Delirium. Other than that all the bars are still there, though IMO a bit hipster except for Kilowatt. Posted By: Rosemarg | May 30 2007 at 07:55 PM Lilo...the closet gay thing won't go away w/substance abuse. Ask Whitney. Posted By: slacker | May 30 2007 at 10:00 PM Gritted teeth! I agree with Bmorejake! Posted By: Lilahjane | May 31 2007 at 01:02 AM What about her mother?? Or is she too busy being drunk someplace else? I'll give Brit's mom some credit, at least she tries, and seems to have learned enough to keep the younger sister out of all that. WTF kind of skank mother goes out drinking w/her teen age daughter? Posted By: pinkblonde | May 31 2007 at 04:00 AM If bringing the legal drinking age down to 18 or even 16, back to where it had been for so long, would mean there'd be even one less "scandalous crime" to report in this or any media outlet (god, can this sorta news actually be called "media"..or "news"?) it would be well worth it.

Gough NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - The "American Idol" finale drove Fox to a primetime ratings win for the week ended Sunday, the last day of the 2006/07 season, according to Nielsen Media Research. ABC was first out of the gate last week with Monday's "Dancing With the Stars" (20.2 million viewers, 5.3 rating/15 share in adults 18-49) and the finale of "The Bachelor: An Officer and a Gentleman" (12.7 million, 4.8/12). But NBC's "Heroes" (13.5 million, 6.2/15) coming out ahead of both in the key demo. Fox's "24" concluded its season with a sub-par 10.3 million, 3.8/10. The penultimate episode of "Idol" (25.3 million, 9.7/27) gave Fox the win in adults 18-49 Tuesday, but a poor showing by the premiere of Fox's Steven Spielberg reality series "On the Lot" (7.6 million, 3.6/9) allowed ABC to win in viewership thanks to the "Dancing" finale (23 million, 6.7/17). Fox again proved victorious Wednesday with the two-hour-plus finale of "Idol" (30.7 million, 11.5/31), which competed for an hour against ABC's two-hour season finale of "Lost" (13.9 million, 5.9/15). Thursday saw the premiere of "So You Think You Can Dance" (9.5 million, 3.7/12), which helped Fox win the night in 18-49 despite a second poor showing from "On the Lot" (5.2 million, 2.1/6). But CBS won in viewership with a night of repeats highlighted by "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (13.8 million, 4.1/12), which even beat "Dance" in the demo. ABC and CBS split Friday, with CBS winning in viewership and ABC in the demo thanks to "National Bingo Night" (5.5 million, 1.8/6) and "20/20" (5.8 million, 1.6/6). CBS won Saturday in viewers with two hours of "48 Hours Mystery" (5.5 million, 1.2/4 and 7.1 million, 2.0/7), while Fox won the demo. Sunday was a day and night of racing, with ABC's Indianapolis 500 averaging 6.4 million viewers and a 1.9 in 18-49, while Fox's running of NASCAR's 600 in primetime averaged 7.5 million viewers and a 2.7 rating in the demo. It was the seventh consecutive year that the 600 topped the 500. For the week, Fox averaged 11.6 million viewers and a 4.4/14 in the demo, followed by CBS (9 million, 2.2/7), ABC (8.9 million, 3.0/9), NBC (5.5 million, 1.9/6) and the CW network (2 million, 0.8/2). &copy; Reuters 2007.

The Franklin Mint/Fox co-promoted Silver Surfer quarters, aimed at promoting the Fantastic Four sequel, aren't legal tender, according to the U.S. Mint. The Mint said late last week that it had told Franklin Mint that it was breaking the law because it's illegal to turn U.S. currency into an advertising vehicle, according to Newsarama. "The promotion is in no way approved, authorized, endorsed, or sponsored by the United States Mint, nor is it in any way associated or affiliated with the United States Mint," the feds wrote. The US Mint did not say whether the studio or The Franklin Mint would face a penalty. Both Fox and Franklin Mint said it was not their intention to break the law. However, according to the original release and contest information, the coins were to be placed into the currency streams across the United States, allowing them to fall into the hands of individuals who would visit the website and enter the contest, according to Newsarama. The Franklin Mint stated: "This legal tender coin is a 2005 California statehood commemorative quarter minted by the United States Mint and specially color-enhanced by The Franklin Mint for Twentieth Century Fox."

Click me to Who should fill Rosie's seat? Rosie O'Donnell on "The View." Photograph by : ABC Erin Carlson, Associated Press Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 Now that Rosie O'Donnell has exited stage left, must find someone to fill her seat and somehow match her watercooler appeal. That won't be easy, but there's a lineup of famous ladies who could make worthy successors. The brash, big-hearted O'Donnell brought edge and excitement to , lifting ratings and making enemies along the way. But in a move out of line with her fighting persona, she chose to depart the ABC talk show earlier than planned following an on-air confrontation with co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck. There's no disputing the star wattage and/or entertainment value of possible replacements Roseanne Barr, Whoopi Goldberg and Bette Midler. Other names that have come up are former talk show host Ricki Lake, comedians Kathy Griffin and Wanda Sykes, Oprah Winfrey's best friend Gayle King and genial actress Sherri Shepherd. No possible contender is buzzier than Barr, who has said she wants the job. Griffin, whose acid-tongued bark is equal to her bite, would be another good choice, said magazine executive editor Dan Wakeford. "She's very similar to Rosie in a lot of ways," Wakeford said. "She elicits strong reactions like Rosie. Love her or hate her, you have a reaction which makes great TV." In that respect, Griffin â who put it ALL out there on her Bravo reality show â certainly delivers. But ... can she deliver viewers? "After dealing with Rosie for a year, Barbara and the producers may prefer someone who's easier to manage and less dramatic," noted Wakefield, who said the less controversial Shepherd is popular with the show's producers. Still, he said, "the most important thing is ratings." Pop culture critic Ken Tucker is skeptical such hopefuls can match O'Donnell's TV talents: humor, controversy and "an ability to keep the show moving." The chatfest needs to "look for a different personality" post-Rosie, Tucker said. He has an idea: Make co-host Joy Behar the moderator and hire the spunky Sykes as a panelist to replace Star Jones (who either quit or was fired last year, depending on whom you believe). The likeable Behar, who has an eternal expression of bemusement, has "really come into her own in the past few months since Rosie's been on," said Tucker, editor-at-large for Entertainment Weekly magazine. "She is somebody who could be the moderator and the kind of voice of reason to keep things going when everybody starts talking over each other." Behar illustrated that talent when she attempted to distract O'Donnell and Hasselbeck during last week's infamous spat, saying: "Who is directing the show? Let's go to a commercial." Tucker's other favorite is Lauren Graham, who formerly starred on TV's . The brunette beauty is "really smart," he said, and has been out of work â hey now! â since the mother-daughter dramedy closed this year. As long as we're on the subject, there are others who should get a look. For your consideration: â¢ Marie Osmond: The wholesome singer and sister of Donny is now an outspoken mother of eight. She was a surprisingly self-assured and appealing guest co-host a few weeks ago â despite her religious upbringing, no "hot topic" seemed off limits. Osmond, who's got loads of life experience and is divorcing her second husband, could be an unexpected foil for the girlish Hasselbeck. â¢ Sharon Osbourne: The wife of Ozzie and mother of three has battled colon cancer, managed her husband's music career and earned TV experience on America's Got Talent, The Osbournes and her own talk show. â¢ Kelly Ripa: The adorable sidekick to Regis Philbin has juggled multiple TV gigs at once. What's one more? â¢ Mo'Nique: The hilarious host of VH1's tells it like it is. But she's charismatic enough to get her own talk show â without co-hosts. Can O'Donnell be equaled? Show creator Walters seems to think so. "We've been a hot show for 10 years," she proclaimed Tuesday on her show, "and we'll be a hot show for many years."

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/05/30/ap3772267.html&cid Low Ratings Underscore NBC Changes - Forbes.com Low Ratings Underscore NBC Changes 05.30.07, 7:14 PM ET Numbingly low Nielsen ratings for last week made it clear why NBC this week hired a new team to oversee its prime-time entertainment department. The once-proud Peacock network averaged only 5.6 million viewers last week, less than half of prime-time leader Fox. Since 1991, NBC has had only two weeks with fewer viewers, and they were both during network TV's summer slumber. NBC Universal announced Tuesday that it was firing entertainment chief Kevin Reilly. The team of successful producer Ben Silverman and financial man Marc Graboff is assuming authority over all NBC programming. The network that once boasted of its "must-see TV" saw most of its Thursday lineup last week - "Scrubs," "30 Rock," "The Office" and "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip" - attract fewer viewers than Univision's telenovela, "Destilando Amor." The one exception was "My Name is Earl," which had 90,000 more viewers than Univision's Thursday hit. NBC burned off an original episode of its much-touted and now dead Aaron Sorkin drama, "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip," Thursday to less than four million viewers. Last week was dominated by the finales of "American Idol" (30.7 million viewers) and "Dancing With the Stars" (23 million) - numbers the broadcast networks won't likely see again until the fall winds blow. For the week, Fox averaged 11.6 million viewers (6.9 rating, 12 share), ) had 9 million (6.0, 11), ABC had 8.9 million (5.8, 10), NBC had 5.6 million (3.7, 7), the CW had 2 million (1.3, 2), My Network TV had 910,000 (0.6, 1) and ION Television had 670,000 (0.4, 1). Among the Spanish language networks, Univision averaged 3.7 million viewers (2.0, 3), Telemundo had 1 million (0.6, 1), TeleFutura had 570,000 (0.3, 1) and Azteca had 310,000 (0.1, 0). ABC's "World News" increased its winning streak in the evening-news ratings to five weeks, its longest since 1996. It averaged 7.8 million viewers (5.5 rating, 12 share), NBC's "Nightly News" had 7.2 million (5.2, 11) and the "CBS Evening News" had 6 million (4.2, 9). A ratings point represents 1,114,000 households, or 1 percent of the nation's estimated 111.4 million TV homes. The share is the percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. For the week of May 21-27, the top 10 shows, their networks and viewerships: "American Idol" (Wednesday), Fox, 30.74 million; "American Idol (Tuesday), Fox, 25.33 million; "Dancing With the Stars Results (Tuesday), ABC, 22.96 million; "Dancing With the Stars" (Monday), ABC, 20.19 million; "NCIS," CBS, 14.14 million; "Lost," ABC, 13.86 million; "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation," CBS, 13.79 million; "Heroes," NBC, 13.48 million; Movie: "Jesse Stone Sea Change," CBS, 13.01 million; "The Bachelor," ABC, 12.67 million.

But perhaps you donât have the energy it takes to lift a paperback â and hey, itâs understandable. Some of those bigger tomes on quality paper can be pretty heavy! Donât worry, to savor âThe Starter Wifeâ (8 p.m. Thursday, USA Network), an enjoyable chick-lit concoction, you donât have to lift anything heavier than your TV remote. This mini-series, which airs for two hours Thursday and has additional episodes on Thursdays in June, is adapted from Gigi Levangie Grazerâs novel of the same name. As adapted by USA, itâs the TV equivalent to a satisfying, entirely inconsequential beach read. You know the kind of book I mean â the one in which you get to secretly revel in the brand names and luxe lifestyle of the heroine and her friends yet still enjoy the satisfaction of condemning them (just a little) for their frivolous, materialistic lives. The fact that the arrogant, unappreciative men in the book get roughed up (metaphorically speaking) is just an added bonus. And of course, aside from the Thoughtless Man, there are always one or two Other Guys, who are Not Mean and maybe Better Than That Jerk the heroine made the mistake of committing her life to. Debra Messing (âWill & Graceâ) plays Molly Kagan, who has spent a decade as the perfect Hollywood wife. Sheâs well-groomed, well-read and runs her husband Kennyâs domestic realm with a firm, efficient hand. Itâs not long, though, before he dumps her, by phone (âI want a divorce. Iâm at the Peninsula.â). Soon sheâs borrowing a friendâs beachside house in Malibu (oh, to have such friends!), while she regroups and contemplates the fact that the entire Hollywood community is shunning her â she keeps showing up to the ârightâ parties and embarrassing everyone. From being married to a mogul for so long, she knows the rules of the Tinseltown community â sheâs supposed to fade away politely. But she canât quite bring herself to do that. She canât quite believe that the country club would cancel her membership without warning and that sheâd be a non-person at all the good restaurants so quickly. Oh, the indignity of no longer getting the best table at the âinâ sushi place! Yes, in the real world, such things are of no consequence, but Messing has the perfect set of skills to make this piffle go down as easily as an ice-cream sundae: As Molly, sheâs hurt, angry and funny in just the right amounts. When her husband starts dating a teeny-bopper pop singer, you not only want to smack the guy but give her a hug. âStarter Wifeâ ticks along at the clip of a woman scanning the sale racks at Barneys; itâs efficient without being too hasty. And as Mollyâs posse of friends, Miranda Otto, Chris Diamantopoulos and especially the wonderfully waspish Judy Davis are an engaging bunch. Joe Mantegna is warm yet enigmatic as a media mogul who takes an interest in Molly, but thereâs also that random surfer dude she keeps seeing on the Malibu beach. Is he a mega-rich mogul who can afford to bum around all day? An out-of-work actor who has nothing better to do than hang out with his dog? Or perhaps heâs that most rare of creatures (in Malibu, anyway) â a regular person. These are the mysteries that the frothy âStarter Wifeâ plumbs. Itâs not deep. But, really, do you deep this time of year? It's nice to see Debra Messing on TV again. I really enjoyed her "Wedding Date." And am looking forward to this one also. After a day of work and taking care of family and home, I like to be entertained. There's enough reality on the 6pm news, a little whimsy does a soul good. And Debra does whimsy very well. She is funny, talented and to laugh before sleep is a good thing! | May 30, 2007 1:18:46 PM I'll pass. I don't think Debra Messing is that great of an actress but seems to play the role of victim very well. Posted by: | May 30, 2007 5:12:33 PM I just read the book, and it was both funny and charming. I'm looking forward to the movie, although the previews demonstrate that it diverts from the book quite a bit. That's par for the course, I guess! Interestingly, in the book the main character's name was Gracie and her best gay friend's name was Will. I could see how, with Debra Messing as the lead, they'd want to change the character's name to Molly, so as not to have "Will and Gracie." :) Posted by: Kristin | May 30, 2007 6:22:55 PM Ugh. I'll pass too. Debra Messing does loud and goofy well, but that's about all. She's a baaaad Lucille Ball knock-off. | May 31, 2007 7:17:41 AM Judy Davis is in it? | May 31, 2007 8:51:50 AM Comments are not posted immediately.

Faces and voices made famous on "American Idol." A Finale To Remember Performances by Gwen Stefani, Bette Midler and Smokey Robinson made this "American Idol" finale unforgettable.

Paula Abdul says she didn't figure out her purpose in life until she became a judge on Fox's "American Idol." "I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on 'American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. "My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success." Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of 'American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul  who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s  says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. Photos: "American Idol" Season 6 "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of 'American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character," she says. The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer." © MMVII The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Skip to next paragraph Paul A. Broben/USA Network Peter Jacobson, left, Debra Messing and Joe Mantegna in this new USA mini-series. In the Magazine: Gigi's Novel Life In a new reality show, Marla Maples, center, is counselor to Kevin, whose wife had an affair. Kim Delaney and Brian McNamara as husband and wife in this new Lifetime series. Betty Friedan made the suburbs safe for sisterhood. By the time Sex and the City rolled around, female bonding  especially over fancy cocktails  was as much a part of popular culture as fishing trips and fraternity hazing rites. The fact that nowadays women are allowed to like one another, even at the expense of men, is at the core of ladies-night hits like Greys Anatomy. So atavistic series like The Bachelor and Desperate Housewives that play down female camaraderie and instead showcase hissy fits and catfights have a naughty, contrarian tang. That retro allure is what drives tonights premiere of The Starter Wife, a USA mini-series that explores the plight of the discarded Hollywood socialite. Its a satire-lite soufflé that follows all the steps of the chick-lit recipe. (If Jane Eyre were written according to todays rules, the orphaned governess would be dragged to a bar by two female friends and a gay male pal and plied with mixed drinks and pool boys until she forgot all about Mr. Rochester and his mad starter wife.) (Will & Grace) plays Molly Kagan, whose studio mogul husband, Kenny (Peter Jacobson), tells her by cellphone that he wants a divorce. Based on a best-selling novel by Gigi Levangie Grazer, the wife of the Hollywood producer , The Starter Wife is a throwback to The Women, Clare Boothe Luces 1936 play about divorce among the rich and pampered. The Starter Wife is set in Malibu and Brentwood, not Park Avenue, so its also a lot like the 1940s radio show Mary Noble, Backstage Wife and the novels of Jackie Collins. These kinds of tell-all tales mix satirical flicks at the follies of the rich and famous (Kenny prepares their young daughter for school by saying, Dont forget to share your cookies with Violet Affleck) with the voyeuristic spectacle of grown-up women channeling their inner Mean Girls. All soap operas centered on women include vixens and villainesses, so the difference lies mainly in the proportion. Molly Kagan has a few loyal female friends  and a gay decorator  but the juice of her tale comes from the snooty, gossiping frienemies who snub her in restaurants and kick her off charity committees when she loses her status as The Wife of. And the beauty of cable lies in the gradation of expectations. On premium networks like HBO or Showtime, The Starter Wife would seem trite and a little too obvious. On USA, its an escapist hoot. The Starter Wife serves as a comic chaser to Army Wives, a more serious, and surprisingly engrossing, Lifetime series on Sunday about what happens to spouses left on base when their soldiers are deployed to combat zones (a lot). Its a little like The Unit, the CBS drama about an elite team of commandos and their wives, but the focus of this Lifetime drama is on the women behind the men in uniform. Army Wives, which stars , examines women of varying age, rank and serial blunder who come together under the stress of military life  and the needling of a few bad women. Not all the bonding spouses are female, however. One member of the clique is an army psychiatrist whose wife returns from a two-year rotation in Afghanistan with a bad case of post-traumatic stress disorder. Female solidarity  or the lack of it  seems to be a popular theme this summer. ABC even ordered up a reality show, Ex-Wives Club, featuring Marla Maples, the former Mrs. ; Angie Everhart, who was once engaged to ; and Shar Jackson, who is the mother of two of Kevin Federlines children and who lost him to . Those three professional exes lend their expertise to ordinary people who are suffering the pain of rejection. Their methods can be brutal. On the premiere, the scornees are sent to a life coach, Debbie Ford, who runs an emotional boot camp in Palm Springs, Calif. The schedule begins early: 8:00 a.m.  Anger. But the founding members of Ex-Wives Club also offer empathy. Ms. Maples was careful in the first episode on Monday to speak well of her ex-husband, but at times she couldnt resist a lateral dig. Ms. Maples helps Kevin, a would-be mortgage broker, organize a networking party in the real estate community. I did this so many years with my ex-husband, she replies when he thanks her. And to be here with someone like you who appreciates it ... Tearing up, she breaks off. Molly could use that kind of support. Instead, when Kenny dumps her for a sexy young pop singer named Shoshanna, Molly finds herself shunned by her fellow worshipers at what she calls the Church of Perpetual Upkeep. After losing her gym membership and even her coveted spot in a Mommy and Me class, she runs away. Not far, however. She retreats to the Malibu house of her oldest and hardest-drinking friend, Joan ( ), who has entered rehab. Lonely, Molly befriends the security guard, Lavender (Anika Noni Rose of Dreamgirls), who is preoccupied with college loans, not collagen. Mollys decorator, Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos), sticks by her, but Cricket (Miranda Otto) is torn. Her husband is a director of blockbuster comedies who wants Kennys studio to back a serious film, The Dutch Bureaucrats Son, and doesnt want Kenny to think he and Cricket side with Molly. It doesnt take long for Cricket to come to her senses. Mollys senses are divided between the flirty overtures of her husbands boss, Lou ( ), and a buff Malibu beach bum, Sam (Stephen Moyer). Army Wives is a street-smart homage to those who also serve because they stand and wait. The Starter Wife is not exactly groundbreaking social satire, but its a sassy look at those who stand behind their Hollywood men, and are waited upon by servants.

Click image to see more pictures. BAD GIRLS GONE WILD Lindsay Lohan isn't the only starlet to find herself making headlines for her troubled lifestyle. - The hotel heiress will have to leave behind purse-size pooch Tinkerbell and all other accessories when she goes to a Los Angeles County jail for violating her probation on a DUI conviction. Hilton, 26, is due to report by June 5 to serve 23 days of a 45-day sentence. - Crooner Lionel Richie's daughter could find herself joining her "Simple Life" co-star Paris in the slammer. The ultra-petite 25-year-old had allegedly been smoking pot and popping Vicodin pills when she was busted last December for driving on the wrong side of a California freeway. It's her second DUI arrest, and a conviction would mean she would have to serve time. - The pop tart checked into rehab after a bizarre meltdown in February during which she shaved her head. Since then, Brit, 25, has been taking steps toward a comeback, but signs that all isn't well resurfaced this month when she threw a hissy fit aboard an L.A.-to-Miami flight because the United Airlines plane didn't have leather seats. The crew, obviously unwilling to listen to more of Ms. Spears' shrewish spiel, let her off the plane. The party may finally be over for Lindsay Lohan. The star-crossed starlet is headed back to rehab, In Touch Weekly magazine reported last night, after a wild Memorial Day weekend in which she crashed her car, was busted for DUI and was later photographed passed out in a car. "She finally realizes it's the right thing to do," In Touch quoted a friend of the actress as saying. "She is going willingly." The magazine said the "Georgia Rule" star was due to check into Promises in Malibu, Calif. - the same facility Britney Spears went to this year after shaving her head. The report came as the Web site x17online.com posted photos showing LiLo - who won't be able to drink legally until she turns 21 on July 2 - taken just 48 hours after the crash. They show a seemingly wasted Lohan passed out in the passenger seat of a car driven by friend and deejay to the stars Samantha Ronson. The pair had just left a Memorial Day pool party at Teddy's at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood when a paparazzo caught up to them at a gas station around 4a.m. yesterday, x17 said. Ronson tried in vain to rouse her sleeping pal, who wore a gray hoodie but no seatbelt, when she realized a photographer was snapping away, x17 said. Ironically, the photos show a medallion dangling in front of the slumbering star from the rear-view mirror. It reads "30 Days" - a reference to the number of days of sobriety. One particularly shocking photo shows Lohan out of the car and on her knees, being watched over by two unidentified men as she seems to vomit on the sidewalk. Another shot shows what appears to be an inch-long fresh cut on the back of her left hand. It was unclear how or when she got the injury. Lohan's rep did not respond to repeated phone calls and e-mails seeking comment. The actress' early morning antics came on the same weekend she was cited for driving under the influence after crashing her Mercedes convertible in Beverly Hills, Calif. Investigators found what they believed to be cocaine in the car after the accident, which happened around 5:30 a.m. Saturday after a night of club crawling. Cops said Lohan could face additional charges when she appears in court Aug. 24. It's the latest in a series of increasingly out-of-control episodes for the young actress. Last summer, a producer scolded herfor failing to show up on the set of the movie "Georgia Rule." She checked into rehab in January, but it wasn't long before she was back on the club scene. And this month she reportedly was thrown out of a hotel where she made a scene after catching love interest Calum Best with another woman. The actress' friends are hoping the tumultuous weekend will serve as a wakeup call. "It's a tough time for her right now," said a close friend, who asked not to be identified. "Everyone is hoping that this is a learning lesson to all."

She said Hasselbeck called and spoke to her partner Kelli Carpenter for a long time. O'Donnell said she didn't speak with Hasselbeck and 'probably won't,' but they did exchange e-mails. The heated debate began Wednesday after O'Donnell's statement about the Iraq war: "655,000 Iraqi civilians have died. Who are the terrorists?" Talk show critics accused O'Donnell of calling U.S. troops terrorists. She called Hasselbeck "cowardly" for not saying anything in response to the critics. "Do not call me a coward, because number one, I sit here every single day, open my heart and tell people what I believe," Hasselbeck fired back, and their riveting exchange continued despite failed attempts by their co-hosts to cut to a commercial. The director used a split screen during the argument with O'Donnell on one side and Hasselbeck on the other. O'Donnell said when she saw the split screen, she "knew it was over" because that made the show look like "The Jerry Springer Show." O'Donnell said she asked for, and received, an early exit from her contract at the daytime chatfest on Friday, ending her eight-month tenure on the show.

News - Hasselbeck Hopes for a Rosie Future - Rosie O'Donnell | Barbara Walters | Rufus Wainwright Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Hasselbeck Hopes for a Rosie Future Tue, 29 May 2007 04:49:14 PM PDT It appears as if that extra day of R&R did everyone good this weekend. While Rosie O&#39;Donnell, now a former cohost of , said in a video posting on her blog that she didn&#39;t envision speaking with Elisabeth Hasselbeck any time soon in light of last week&#39;s politically charged dustup, Hasselbeck was back on the air Tuesday suggesting that a reconciliation was still in the cards. Hasselbeck said that she and O&#39;Donnell were "in communication a lot," although she didn&#39;t specify just how she and her left-leaning ex-colleague were keeping the lines open. "This weekend gave us the opportunity to tackle our most important hot topic yet, and that was the power of forgiveness," Hasselbeck told the audience today. "And so now that enables us to move on in a very positive way...I&#39;m very happy about that." (Translation: Rosie is out, so let&#39;s get on with the show.) Meanwhile, O&#39;Donnell said on her Website Saturday that she wrote Hasselbeck an email, who in turn wrote back&mdash;and that was it. "I haven&#39;t spoken to her, and I probably won&#39;t," O&#39;Donnell said, "and I think it&#39;s just as well." , who wasn&#39;t there for the on-air shenanigans that Joy Behar so desperately tried to moderate, then reassured the audience that she had emailed O&#39;Donnell over the weekend and that they remain "close friends." O&#39;Donnell, whose persistent outspokenness and opinionated banter had been very good for the ratings this past year (especially after she and Donald Trump got into it), will always be welcome as a panelist on the show any time, Walters added. The chattiest of the four chat mavens had been set to leave when her year-long contract ran out at the end of June, but instead expedited her departure after her latest war of words with her conservative counterpart, in which each accused the other of acting cowardly when it came to their political allegiances. First, O&#39;Donnell got on Hasselbeck&#39;s case last Wednesday for not defending her earlier in the week when some conservative critics accused her of comparing U.S. troops in Iraq to terrorists, calling her cohost "cowardly" for saying nothing in her defense. Hasselbeck then fired back by saying that she was not on the show to fight O&#39;Donnell&#39;s battles for her and that she did what she felt was right by asking O&#39;Donnell to take the time to further explain her remarks. "I&#39;ll tell you what&#39;s cowardly," Hasselbeck said. "Asking a rhetorical question&mdash;that&#39;s cowardly." The total exchange lasted about 10 minutes before producers finally cut to commercial. O&#39;Donnell then had a scheduled day off on Thursday; however, she ended up calling it quits for good and never came back. But although her schedule opened up a little sooner than she had planned, O&#39;Donnell has already signed up for a trip back to her roots. The former stand-up comic has added another three dates as a special guest on the upcoming True Colors Tour which kicks off June 8, in honor of Gay & Lesbian Pride Month, at Las Vegas&#39; MGM Grand Garden Arena. Benefiting the Human Rights Campaign, the tour will feature the musical talents of Cyndi Lauper, Erasure, Debbie Harry, the Dresden Dolls, the Gossip and the Misshapes. Margaret Cho will emcee the festivities. "It&#39;s a dream come true to be on the road with Cyndi Lauper," O&#39;Donnell said. "I&#39;m almost a rock star!" Lauper, the tour&#39;s founder, seconded the sentiment. "I am thrilled that Rosie is able to do more shows on the tour," the "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" singer said. "We have always wanted to tour together. It&#39;s going to be a blast." O&#39;Donnell will be along for the ride in Las Vegas, Chicago, New York, Dallas, Houston and Washington, D.C. Other acts set to play select dates include , Indigo Girls, the Cliks, Cazwell, Amanda Lepore and Jeffree Star.

At first I didn't want Rosie to leave The View, but now I realize it was for the best. The View will be ending soon, and Rosie will be moving on to bigger and better things. It is so hard for me to read all of these hate-filled posts about Rosie; she is a good person and has done SO much for foster children, soldiers, etc. She has given, given, and given some more. I wish I could say the same for EH. tpiland on 05/30/2007 10:37AM deezjag... it's a bit... deezjag... it's a bit hypocritical of you to say you don't like Rosie because she shoves her political views down your throat but then commend Elisabeth.

I SERIOUSLY doubt that Rosie asked her headwriter to do that. It was just her headwriter's choice to do something as childish as deface EH's pic. And for all you people who say Rosie is a "bully" haven't you ever had an argument with someone and YOU thought YOU were right??? Looks to me like Elisabeth was doing the same thing - she wasn't a mouse in the corner taking Ro's punches. She gave as good as she got. evanettie on 05/30/2007 8:28AM So now Rosie didn't t... So now Rosie didn't think she ever belonged on the View . . . what a crock. That babe needs some serious mental help . . . and I do hope she gets it before she does more damage to herself and her poor kids. Just think what she must be like at home. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinion but when someone disagreed with her she turned into the school yard bully and made sure you knew you didn't have an opinion if she didn't like it. Dr. Phil would have a field day with her!! tigger624 on 05/30/2007 8:27AM Rosie is a spoiled br... Rosie is a spoiled brat that tries to push her outlandish view points on others.

I must say that I think I would like Rosie in the real world until, that is, she started shoving her political views down my throat! I really enjoyed watching her on The View until she would start in ranting and raving about her point of view. My impression is, if you don't agree with Rosie she will railroad and bully her way through a conversation... just like she did last week with Elisabeth! I was glad to see Elisabeth FINALLY stand up for herself and not allow anymore of Rosie's crap! deezjag on 05/30/2007 7:19AM Elizabeth, a nobody! ... Elizabeth, a nobody! It's comical when you look at the panel and their individual accomplishments. Elizabeth's resume includes Survivor? Oops, guess sanctimonious could be added as well. Like it or not, Rosie's a powerplay in Hollywood, always has been and always will be. Rosie can impact Elizabeth's career from A-Z if she chose to. Elizabeth's short stint at attempted fame is almost over, she'll have few television prospects due to her childish onscreen activity. EFan on 05/30/2007 6:56AM I love Rosie...you go...

When she came back and told Rosie that what is really cowardly is to ask rhetorical questions...she NAILED it!!

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Spector Defense Targets Forensic Errors Wednesday, May 30, 2007; 9:20 PM LOS ANGELES -- A coroner who concluded that Lana Clarkson's death was a homicide testified Wednesday in Phil Spector's murder trial that he cannot tell from autopsy results whether the actress was holding the gun that killed her. The statement was important because the music producer's defense is seeking to show that the 40-year-old killed herself. The coroner, Dr. Louis Pena, said he left the manner of death in the case undetermined for seven months before he wrote a report finding it was a homicide. Dr. Louis Pena, a deputy medical examiner, testifies during cross-examination in the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector, Wednesday, May 30, 2007, at Los Angeles Superior Court in Los Angeles. Investigators made mistakes in evidence collection and handling in actress Lana Clarkson's shooting death, including the loss of a piece of one of her teeth, Pena conceded Wednesday. (AP Photo/Robyn Beck, Pool) (Robyn Beck - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article Pena said that Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as "pending" until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didn't necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. "There are two ways to look at it," said Pena. "It implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity." On Tuesday, Pena testified that Clarkson had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. But he conceded Wednesday he didn't consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The medical examiner also said that criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarkson's teeth. Pena acknowledged in cross-examination by defense attorney Christopher Plourd that the mistakes also included moving Clarkson's body, which caused blood to flow out of her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Pena said the lost tooth fragment was the fault of an odontologist _ a forensic dentist _ who was called in on the case. "There were three vials collected to be examined by the odontologist," Pena said. "What happened is on review in meeting with the odontologist he admitted he broke one of the vials and the tooth fragment was lost. It flew around the room somewhere." Asked how this happened, Pena said, "When my back was turned he took it out, cracked the vial, panicked _ as he told me _ and sealed it again." Pena said the fragment was never found. The coroner said he had found some of the tooth fragments on a red carpet in front of Clarkson's body and some on a staircase nearby, indicating that the force of the gunshot fired inside her mouth sent her two front teeth flying out. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coroner's office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarkson's dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised the ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. As for the blood from the mouth, the memo said, "Body movement caused oral purge which soaked the side of the dress and also compromised evaluation of the dress for blood spatter." In other testimony, Pena said he was aware at the death scene that a piece of acrylic nail was missing from Clarkson's right thumb. The prosecution claims that defense experts later found the piece of nail when they searched the scene but withheld it from authorities. Pena said there was no evidence that Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. Clarkson had been taking two drugs generally given for depression, but her neurologist had prescribed them for her chronic headaches, the coroner said. He said she died with a purse on one shoulder in a stranger's home, which he said is not typical of someone taking her own life. He also cited evidence that the gun had been wiped and a large amount of Clarkson's blood was in the left pocket of Spector's pants, which could indicate the gun was placed in the pocket. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the "Wall of Sound" recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Corman's 1985 cult film "Barbarian Queen."

The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which regulates liquor licensing, is looking into whether alcohol was served illegally to Lohan in the hours before her arrest by police in Beverly Hills, an agency spokesman said on Wednesday. The 20-year-old actress was booked on suspicion of driving under the influence after running her Mercedes over a curb and into a hedge at about 5:30 a.m. on Saturday. Police said they also found a substance in the car they believe to be cocaine. Her arrest came about two hours after she was seen leaving a popular Hollywood eatery. It was followed by a second night of partying that ended early Monday with Lohan captured in widely published photos passed out in the front seat of a car. Later that day, Lohan, an acknowledged Alcoholic Anonymous member who underwent rehab earlier this year, checked herself into another treatment facility. Lohan's latest woes cast doubt about whether the promising young actress, publicly rebuked by a producer last year for on-set tardiness, would be available to begin shooting her next film as planned with Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine. Her arrest also focused attention on the nightclubs and restaurants that cater to Hollywood's rich and famous and their complicity in serving alcohol to individuals under the legal drinking age of 21. A flurry of reports about underage stars and lesser-known minors frequenting Los Angeles-area nightspots prompted the state's ABC board to launch an enforcement crackdown that has resulted in 10 undercover operations so far, agency spokesman John Carr said. &copy; Reuters 2007.

All I do is ask questions Geek boy meets gorgeous girl. Girl gets pregnant. Boy embraces fatherhood. Our correspondent meets the director behind a seriously funny sex comedy to not show photographer information --> to not show image description --> to not show enlarge option --> Something is changing in the world of American screen comedy. Inane semen-splattered teen movies in the vein of American Pie are out, as are witless pastiches in the Scary Movie mould. And so too are puerile efforts such as Beerfest. In their place come character-led dramatic comedies. These are cleverly constructed stories, heartfelt and often profane, intricately scripted and yet laden with gags, and all delivered by a peerless ensemble of character actors and up-and-coming comedy giants. The 40-Year-Old Virgin was one. Will Ferrell&rsquo;s Anchorman was another, as was Talladega Nights. These movies, hugely popular with global audiences, have made nearly $1 billion (&pound;1.97 million) in revenue and have inspired a comedy wave that&rsquo;s about to crash on our shores this summer with the peerless pregnancy caper Knocked Up, followed by a slew of side-splitters, including Superbad, Walk Hard and Step Brothers. And what&rsquo;s more, every one of them can be traced back to one unassuming man &ndash; the unsung comedy hero and current God of Gags, Judd Apatow. &ldquo;I just see it all as an embarrassment of riches at the moment,&rdquo; says the 39-year-old writer-director-producer, a former stand-up comedian who for years survived by writing gags for Jim Carrey and producing television shows, before making it big with two Will Ferrell comedies and his own directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Now, he says, half-be-mused at his own success, he simply can&rsquo;t get the movies out fast enough. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s been totally bananas,&rdquo; he says, about his new role as a comedy mogul. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve shot six movies this year alone. They&rsquo;re all movies that we have worked on for a long time, with different writers and directors. But once a few of our movies did well we had a flood of projects go straight into development.&rdquo; The first is Knocked Up, Apatow&rsquo;s highly anticipated directorial follow-up to Virgin and a searing exemplar of the New Comedy. The movie has an ostensibly simple premise &ndash; a stoner schlub called Ben (Seth Rogen) impregnates glamorous career woman Alison (Katherine Heigl) during a one-night stand and hilarity ensues. Yet the unfettered genius here is that Apatow uses this familiar framework on which to hang lovingly crafted characters and deliciously uncomfortable drama. For instance, Alison&rsquo;s sister Debbie (played by Apatow&rsquo;s wife, Leslie Mann) is in the middle of a marriage implosion and has savagely funny arguments with her screen husband Pete (Paul Rudd). Marriage is like a comedy with all the jokes removed, complains Pete at one point, adding, &ldquo;Instead of pithy dialogue, everyone&rsquo;s just pissed off!&rdquo; Elsewhere there&rsquo;s profanity-laden dialogue, inspired sexual innuendo, relentless pot-smoking, and a comedy set piece that revolves around awkward pregnancy sex between Ben and Alison. All of this, naturally, has landed Knocked Up with a family-unfriendly R rating in America (somewhere between a 15 and an 18 in Britain). Yet Apatow remains unapologetic and sees it, instead, as a badge of honour for the New Comedy. &ldquo;For me, if you&rsquo;re going to attempt to be truthful, it&rsquo;s almost impossible to do it with any rating other than an R,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;If I&rsquo;m going to tell a story about relationships &ndash; you know, people curse, they have sex, and they smoke things they shouldn&rsquo;t &ndash; all of that puts you in an R.&rdquo; Apatow grew up on Long Island. A physically weak kid, he says he was obsessed by comedy from the age of 10 and used to transcribe episodes of Saturday Night Live to understand it better. His parents divorced when he was 12, and his mother started working at a comedy club near his home in Huntington, called East Side. There Apatow would interview comedy giants such as Eddie Murphy and Roseanne Barr, ostensibly for his high-school radio station, but really, he says, to discover the secrets of great comedy. &ldquo;I did about 50 interviews and they really did give me the answers,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And the main bit of advice I got was that I needed to be patient. So I worked really hard. I always assumed that I would get better, and I wasn&rsquo;t anxious about making it.&rdquo; Apatow moved to Los Angeles after high school and started doing stand-up at the city&rsquo;s famous comedy club, the Improv. But success as a performer eluded him. &ldquo;At the time I lived with Adam Sandler, and I was opening up for Jim Carrey, and it became clear to me that I was never going to be as good as any of these guys. So I began selling jokes to support myself.&rdquo; He quickly graduated from gag-seller to writer-producer and the brain behind such award-winning television as The Larry Sanders Show and The Ben Stiller Show. He says that after four years in television he thought, finally: &ldquo;Well, I guess I should go get some testicles and attempt to make a movie.&rdquo; His first attempt was a producer&rsquo;s role on the wildly successful Will Ferrell vehicle Anchorman, followed by his directorial debut, The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Meanwhile, he had built up his own stable of new white-hot writers and directors, including Rogen, who has written the high-school comedy Superbad, and the director Jake Kasdan, who has just finished an Apatow-scripted mock musical biopic called Walk Hard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a goof on movies like Ray and Walk the Line,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And I have to say, it&rsquo;s as funny as anything that we&rsquo;ve done.&rdquo; And yet, untold riches and a preeminent place in the New Comedy universe will not make you happy, Apatow cautions. &ldquo;One thing I&rsquo;ve learnt from all this is that success is just as uncomfortable as failure. When all these good things happen, it simply takes the cloak off your &lsquo;real&rsquo; problems.&rdquo; So why do you keep going? &ldquo;I think that, after a while, making comedy becomes a defence mechanism. There probably is a great argument for stopping, but at some point it becomes your way of navigating life, and you slowly realise that you don&rsquo;t know how to do anything else.&rdquo; &mdash; Knocked Up opens nationwide on August 24 Apatow, nurturer of comic talent Cast in The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Rogen finally takes centre stage in Knocked Up. Also a writer, his Superbad is being produced by Apatow. Mann met Apatow on the set of The Cable Guy. They married in 1997. In Knocked Up she plays a long-suffering wife. The son of Lawrence Kasdan ( The Big Chill) has directed the mock musical biopic Walk Hard, co-written by Apatow. Apatow, friend of the famous A friend since Carrey&rsquo;s stand-up days. Apatow contributed uncredited &ldquo;punch-ups&rdquo; on scripts for Carrey&rsquo;s Liar Liar and Bruce Almighty. He met Stiller in 1990, outside an Elvis Costello concert. Apatow then wrote and produced Stiller&rsquo;s Emmy award-winning series The Ben Stiller Show. Shared a flat with Apatow during the pair&rsquo;s early years at the LA comedy club, the Improv. When Sandler hit the big time, Apatow helped out on the script for Happy Gilmore. Apatow met Shandling at the East Side stand-up club when he was still in high school. Later, Apatow was a writer-producer on The Larry Sanders Show. Apatow met him on the set of Anchorman, where Carell told him about a sketch involving a middle-aged man trying to hide his virginity from his friends. The 40-Year-Old Virgin &ndash; and Carell&rsquo;s stardom &ndash; were born. * Town / City Save to my times One last drop in the Ocean?

Welcome to The Sydney Morning Herald. Lindsay Lohan returns to rehab A tour bus passes the location where Lindsay Lohan was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence Saturday, May 26, after her convertible struck a curb at Sunset Boulevard and Foothill Road in Beverly Hills, Calif. Lohan charged with DUI, investigated for drugs May 30, 2007 - 10:06AM Actress Lindsay Lohan has returned to rehab after a weekend drunken-driving arrest, her publicist said on Tuesday, raising questions about whether she can start shooting her latest film as planned. Official word that Lohan was back in treatment came hours after entertainment trade paper said she had just joined the cast of , a comedy starring Shirley MacLaine and set to begin filming this week. But her Beverly Hills arrest on Saturday on suspicion of driving under the influence, and police reports that a substance believed to be cocaine was found in the car, triggered a wave of headlines trumpeting Hollywood's latest celebrity relapse. Less than 48 hours after the arrest, Lohan was photographed slumped in the passenger seat of a car. posted the photos yesterday , which it said were taken early that morning at a petrol station after the 20-year-old actress left the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California, with a girlfriend. The photos show Lohan, wearing a grey hooded sweat shirt, with her mouth open and her eyes shut, apparently asleep. Another photo shows her kneeling on the ground, her back to the camera, apparently vomiting before getting into the vehicle. "Lindsay admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility on Memorial Day," her publicist has said in a statement. "Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation," the statement continued. No further details were given. But several celebrity news outlets, including magazine online, said Lohan checked in on Monday to the Promises treatment centre in Malibu, the luxury facility where pop star Britney Spears was recently a patient. According to TMZ's report, Lohan was admitted to Promises for in-patient treatment, possibly for 30 days, sparking questions about a potential conflict with her new film. Representatives for the film's production company, Still Rolling Prods, and MacLaine, who also is co-producing the film, were not immediately available for comment. But it would not be the first time that Lohan's personal life has put her at odds with demands of her career. Last July, the producer of&#160; took the unusual step of going public with a letter to Lohan scolding her for repeatedly showing up late on the set. In his unusual reprimand, the Morgan Creek Prods executive James Robinson called her behavior "discourteous, irresponsible and unprofessional" and cited her "ongoing all-night heavy partying" as the reason for her tardiness. Lohan returned to work the next day, and , which paired her with film legend Jane Fonda, was released earlier this month. Earlier this year, following completion of filming,&#160;Lohan underwent her first stint in rehab.

News - Match Game Fixture Reilly Dies Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Mon, 28 May 2007 08:50:24 PM PDT Jack Lemmon and Steve McQueen were New York acting school contemporaries of the acclaimed stage star and director named...blank. answer is: Charles Nelson Reilly. Reilly, whose award-winning theater career was overshadowed by his knack for filling in the blanks with punchlines on and other TV game shows, has died of pneumonia, his partner told Monday&#39;s The actor-director passed away last Friday in his Beverly Hills home, Patrick Hughes told the paper. Reilly was said to have been in failing health for more than a year. He was 76. For the uninitiated, the Game Show Network offers everyday proof of why Reilly was as much a part of the 1970s as the pet rock. The Internet Broadway Database offers evidence of a career that was much broader than his banter with Brett Somers suggested. Reilly directed five Broadway plays, appeared in the original productions of How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , earned three Tony nominations, including one for directing the 1997 production of , and won one, for his supporting work in In 2002, Reilly won a Drama Desk Award for his one-man show of an autobiography, Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly "I was told that I would never be allowed on television," Reilly said in the show&#39;s 2006 film version, The Life of Reilly , "and now I gotta try to figure out who do you have to f--- to get off." The quip offered a good summary of Reilly&#39;s career, if not his career dilemma: Once told by a network executive that TV was off-limits to "queers," the Bronx-born actor, who was gay, became known as a TV personality to the exclusion of everything else. Reilly guested on sitcoms ( Nanny and the Professor The Patty Duke Show , etc.), cackled his way through a children&#39;s show (Sid and Marty Krofft&#39;s colorful, but typically creepy ), sat down on couch 95 times, per one popularly cited count, and, of course, did game shows. Lots of game shows. were among Reilly&#39;s credits. was by far the biggest. To explain exactly what was, or what Reilly did on it, is perhaps best left to a Game Show Network description of a February 1976 episode: "Brett and Charles get into such a bad fight that Gene separates them, moving Charles to the bottom row." Brett was the aforementioned Brett Somers, an actress best known, like Reilly, for being the game-show version of herself. Gene was Gene Rayburn, the host best known for his probe-like microphone. , it was less of a quiz show, and more of an excuse for Reilly, Somers and Rayburn (and sometimes Richard Dawson and Fannie Flagg) to bicker, try to make each other laugh, and unleash some barely doubled entendres. With apologies to Somers&#39; giant glasses, and Rayburn&#39;s impossibly long microphone, Reilly cut the show&#39;s most distinctive figure, as he was often seen puffing a pipe, wearing a captain&#39;s hat and donning glasses even larger than Somers&#39;. The most popular version of ran on daytime TV from 1973 to &#39;79, and in syndication from 1975 to &#39;81, per an accounting by Total Television. , Reilly frequently worked with to the star&#39;s 1990s sitcom, . He also found success with Chris Carter, appearing on a 1996 episode of Carter&#39;s , and a 1997 episode of the producer&#39;s lesser-known series, . Reilly played the same character, a writer named Jose Chung, in both Carter shows; he netted the second of his three career Emmy nominations for the Born Jan. 13, 1931, per the Internet Movie Database, Reilly trained for the acting life under the tutelage of Uta Hagen, and alongside the likes of Lemmon and McQueen. Those master classes won&#39;t be on cable TV on Tuesday morning or the morning after that; will. As Reilly well knew. "When I die, it&#39;s going to read, &#39;Game Show Fixture Passes Away,&#39;" Reilly once said, per a Hollywood Stock Exchange review of Life of Reilly.

Dressed in a black, red and purple Japanese-style gown, Riyo Mori nervously grabbed the hands of first runner-up, Natalia Guimaraes of Brazil, just before the winner was announced. Then she threw her hands up and covered her mouth, overcome with emotion. Winner of Miss Universe 2007, Miss Japan Riyo Mori parades in the evening gown competition of the pageant at the National Auditorium in Mexico City May 28, 2007. [Reuters] But she gathered herself together enough to catch the diamond-and-pearl-studded headpiece valued at $250,000 as it slipped off her head when Miss Universe 2006 Zuleyka Rivera of Puerto Rico crowned her. Mori immediately placed it back on her head. The last time Japan won the pageant was in 1959 when Akiko Kojima became the first Miss Universe from Asia. "She is an amazing champion, an amazing woman and I hear that they go totally insane in Japan, so that's good," said Donald Trump, who co-owns the pageant with NBC. Miss USA Rachel Smith, who slipped and fell to the floor during the evening gown competition and was jeered by the Mexican audience during the interview phase, was the contest's fourth runner-up. Mori, from the small town of Shizuoka at the base of Mount Fuji, won the cheers of the Mexico City audience when she opened her interview, saying 'Hola, Mexico!' "I learned how to always be happy, be patient and to be positive, and this is what I want to teach to the next generation," she said during the interview competition. The daughter of a dance school operator, Mori said her grandmother told her as a child that she wanted her to be Miss Japan before she turned 20. "From the very beginning, I entered the competition with high hopes and an unswerving determination to make this dream a reality," she said in a pre-competition interview. She wants to someday open an international dance school in Tokyo. "Right now I am only 20 years old, so I'm really excited about what I'm going to be able to do at this age to benefit society," Mori said after winning. Smith was booed during her interview and several audience members chanted "Mexico! Mexico!" until she spoke in Spanish, saying "Buenas noches Mexico. Muchas gracias!" which earned her applause. Mexico has a fierce rivalry with its northern neighbor. Also finishing in the top five were second runner-up Ly Jonaitis of Venezuela and third runner-up Honey Lee of Korea. The winner travels the world for a year on behalf of charities and pageant sponsors. The 15 finalists from a field of 77 contestants were announced early in Monday's show. They were picked last week during preliminary judging in the contest's swimsuit, evening gown and interview categories. Their names were not announced until Monday, allowing all 77 to be introduced to the television audience. As soon as the final 15 had been selected, they immediately strutted across the stage in animal-print bikinis for the swimsuit competition. After the evening gown competition, five contestants were eliminated, and the judges chose the winner from the five remaining. Missing from this year's contest was Miss Sweden, whose country is one of the few to win the crown three times. Isabel Lestapier Winqvist, 20, dropped out because many Swedes say the competition does not represent the modern woman. Hours before the pageant began, dozens of protesters held a mock ceremony in downtown Mexico City that featured "Miss Marijuana," "Miss Sexual Health," "Miss Human Rights" and other candidates with obscenities written across their sashes. The group yelled "Neither ugly nor beautiful, should a woman be considered an object!" Pageant organizers say the Miss Universe contest carefully selects women who are intelligent, well-mannered and cultured. 1999 Miss Teen USA Vanessa Minnillo and "Extra" weekend correspondent Mario Lopez hosted the live, two-hour telecast, broadcast on NBC and Telemundo, expected to be viewed by more than 600 million people in more than 180 countries. The celebrity judges included actor James Kyson Lee, model Lindsay Clubine, Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, rocker Dave Navarro, Olympic figure skating champion Michelle Kwan, celebrity hairstylist Ken Paves, fashion designer Marc Bouwer, "Project Runway" judge and Elle magazine fashion director Nina Garcia and former Miss Universe Dayanara Torres.

For some, a poorly written email has cost them customers and their business's reputation. For others, poorly written and emails in bad taste has cost them their jobs. Eric Govan's 'Ghetto Prom Pics' email sent to reporters, columnists and sports editors got him fired from his coveted position in media relations for the Golden State Warriors. So this is bad PR for Nicole Richie, cracking jokes about the emaciated in Hollywood, what if it was an email bad-mouthing a co-star, collaborator or producer. These days, email etiquette and checking your 'to' field is a must in both your personal and business lives. May 30th, 2007 - 04:01:47 why does anyone give the time of day to these no-talent celebrities?? There are many others out there who are smart, talented and respectful - so ignore this group of slime!

Giant hog shot in Alabama An 11-year-old Alabama boy used a pistol to kill a wild hog his father says weighed a staggering 1,051 pounds and measured 9-feet-4 from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. Think hams as big as car tires. If the claims are accurate, Jamison Stone's trophy boar would be bigger than Hogzilla, the famed wild hog that was killed in south Georgia in 2004. Hogzilla originally was thought to weigh 1,000 pounds and measure 12 feet in length. National Geographic experts who unearthed its remains believe the animal actually weighed about 800 pounds and was 8 feet long. Regardless of the comparison, Jamison is reveling in the attention over his pig, which has a Web site put up by his father -- www.monsterpig.com -- that is generating Internet buzz. "It feels really good," Jamison, of Pickensville, said. "It's a good accomplishment. I probably won't ever kill anything else that big." Jamison, who killed his first deer at age 5, was hunting with father Mike Stone and two guides in east Alabama on May 3 when he bagged Hogzilla II. He said he shot the huge animal eight times with a .50-caliber revolver and chased it for three hours through hilly woods before finishing it off with a point-blank shot. Through it all there was the fear that the animal would turn and charge them, as wild boars have a reputation of doing. "I was a little bit scared, a little bit excited," said Jamison, who just finished the sixth grade on the honor roll at Christian Heritage Academy, a small, private school. His father said that, just to be extra safe, he and the guides had high-powered rifles aimed and ready to fire in case the beast with 5-inch tusks decided to charge. With the pig finally dead in a creek bed on the 2,500-acre Lost Creek Plantation, a commercial hunting preserve in Delta, trees had to be cut down and a backhoe brought in to bring Jamison's prize out of the woods. It was hauled on a truck to the Clay County Farmers Exchange in Lineville, where Jeff Kinder said they used his scale, which was recently calibrated, to weigh the hog. Kinder, who didn't witness the weigh-in, said he was baffled to hear the reported weight of 1,051 pounds because his scale -- an old, manual style with sliding weights -- only measures to the nearest 10. "I didn't quite understand that," he said. Mike Stone said the scale balanced one notch past the 1,050-pound mark, and he thought it meant a weight of 1,051 pounds. "It probably weighed 1,060 pounds. We were just afraid to change it once the story was out," he said. The hog's head is now being mounted on an extra-large foam form by Jerry Cunningham of Jerry's Taxidermy in Oxford. Cunningham said the animal measured 54 inches around the head, 74 inches around the shoulders and 11 inches from the eyes to the end of its snout. "It's huge," he said. "It's just the biggest thing I've ever seen." Mike Stone is having sausage made from the rest of the animal. "We'll probably get 500 to 700 pounds," he said. Jamison, meanwhile, has been offered a small part in "The Legend of Hogzilla," a small-time horror flick based on the tale of the Georgia boar. The movie is holding casting calls with plans to begin filming in Georgia. Jamison is enjoying the newfound celebrity generated by the hog hunt, but he said he prefers hunting pheasants to monster pigs. "They are a little less dangerous."

During the celebrity-infested barbecue, held at the house of Richie's friend, the socialite reportedly didn't touch the food. "Nicole didn't eat anything," a witness told US magazine Reports claim it was at the same Memorial Day barbecue that Mischa Barton fell ill and had to be rushed to hospital after reportedly consuming a stomach-churning mix of antibiotics and alcohol. However, new rumours originating from suggest that Barton actually overdosed on magic mushrooms and cocaine and had to be evacuated from the party on a stretcher. "It was total chaos," one partygoer told the site. Paris Hilton's recent jail sentence has reportedly left Richie terrified that she will also wind up in jail. "When Nicole heard about Paris' sentence, she broke down," an insider said. "She's been eating less. She's only sleeping three hours a night. She has nightmares about being in prison and wakes up in cold sweats." Richie is reportedly doing outpatient rehab treatment with Beau Monde Programs.

http://www.huffingtonpost.com/danny-miller/laughing-with-charles-nel_b_49681.html&cid Danny Miller: Laughing with Charles Nelson Reilly | The Huffington Post Laughing with Charles Nelson Reilly Posted May 28, 2007 I was lucky enough to know Charles Nelson Reilly, one of the funniest people on the planet. Reilly died this weekend after a very long illness, and today is being mourned by his showbiz colleagues, the public at large, and his legions of former acting students. Charles' oft-stated concern that when he died the headlines would read "Game Show Fixture Passes Away" has come true in part (I saw that exact headline on several news sites) but plenty of people also remember his Tony Award-winning performances in the theatre and his amazing work as a director of plays and opera. My wife Kendall Hailey was a close friend of Charles and his partner Patrick. He jokingly called her his fiancÃ©e during much of their friendship and somewhere there is a fake prom photo that Charles staged in the 1980s with Kendall in a ghastly taffeta dress and Charles wearing a frilly tuxedo and a purposely bad toupee. Kendall used it as her Christmas card that year and her conservative Texas grandparents were concerned about her "boyfriend" who seemed so much older. Kendall could almost be considered a Love Child of "The Match Game." Charles' sparring partner, Brett Somers, is Kendall's godmother, and as far as I'm concerned, her biggest claim to fame was when Brett wrote "Happy Birthday Kendall" on one of her "Match Game" cards when Kendall was a kid and held it up to the camera, prompting a discussion about her birthday with host Gene Rayburn. I still love watching the old "Match Game" episodes on the Game Show Network. In my opinion some of the best comedy ever seen on television came from the impromptu antics of Charles and Brett on that show. They got away with a ribald, wicked repartee that would never be allowed on network television today--at least not without massive FCC fines. As anyone who met him knows, from his celebrity friends to the fans on the street to his nurses in the hospital, being in Charles' presence was like being a willing victim of a high energy tsunami. Hearing him tell anecdotes about his crazy life was irresistible and you never wanted him to stop, he was so much fun to be around. He seemed to know everyone in showbiz, from the sublime to the ridiculous, and he spoke reverentially of many of his talented friends, including Uta Hagen and Julie Harris. He directed Miss Harris in "The Belle of Amherst" and an acclaimed revival of "The Gin Game," after starring with her decades earlier in the musical "Skyscraper." As a child I was most familiar with Charles as Claymore Gregg in the TV series, "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir," as well as the villainous magician Horatio J. HooDoo in the freaky Sid and Marty Krofft series "Lidsville" from the early 70s. The writers of this show may not have consciously been making drug references in the scripts but it's hard to believe that the person who created this land of living hats wasn't smoking something! Reading some of the accolades today, I am struck by the diversity of the people from all walks of life who loved him. Charles was one of the first openly gay men on television, and probably did more to promote gay rights than many activists marching in the street. My brother-in-law, Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, was a huge Charles fan. A few years ago, when Jeff was in town mixing the Wilco CD "Summerteeth," we brought Charles to the recording studio for a visit. Charles immediately had the entire rock crowd under his spell. They all wanted to pose for pictures with him and they seemed more excited to see Charles than if a member of the Rolling Stones had wandered in. Someone handed him a CD by a band called the Didjits called "Full Nelson Reilly" and Charles signed it to Jeff, "From one rock star to another." Kendall's favorite Charles story takes place when he was appearing in New York and staying at the Wyndham Hotel. Charles found himself riding in the elevator alone with Sir Laurence Olivier. He said nothing to Olivier on the way up but as the elevator door opened, Charles turned to the renowned actor and deadpanned, "If I'd known this was a theatrical establishment, I would have booked elsewhere." Charles had a great sense of humor about all things, including himself. Has there ever been anyone more parodied than he was? Remember Alec Baldwin's killer impersonation on "Saturday Night Live?" Charles didn't stop working until he got sick, and he was known to more recent audiences as Jose Chung on "The X Files" and "Millennium" and the voice of the Dirty Bubble on "SpongeBob SquarePants." I wish I could have seen Charles in his early plays which included "Bye, Bye Birdie," "Hello, Dolly," and "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." But we loved seeing Charles perform his moving autobiographical show, "Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly," which, thank God, has been turned into a documentary by Barry Poltermann that debuted last year at the SXSW Festival and is winning awards at film festivals all over the country. Here's the trailer and a poignant glimpse at the genius that is Charles Nelson Reilly: Read All Posts by The Mollycoddling of Rosie O'Donnell Arianna Huffington: Notes from the D Conference: An iPhone Tip from Steve Jobs and Genetic Info from 23andMe Philip Giraldi: No New 9/11?

Michael Lohan says his daughter Lindsay is in a detox program to kick multiple addictions to alcohol and drugs including the prescription painkiller OxyContin. "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay because I want to make sure she is getting the right care," Michael Lohan told E! Online's The Planet Gossip co-host Tina Dirmann. "And I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from painkillers and things. That's a very important step." Michael Lohan, who was released from New York's Collins Correctional Facility in March after serving nearly two years on attempted assault and other charges, has had his own battles with addiction. He went to bible college while behind bars and became a minister with the Assemblies of God Ministry. Photos: Livin' La Vida Lohan That's why he's pleased that there's a spiritual aspect to the recovery program his daughter will undergo. "I learned they use the 12-step program, which includes a lot of lessons bases on God's teachings, so I was satisfied with that," he said. "First she needs to get clean, then she needs to let God in her life." Meanwhile, authorities conducting undercover operations at trendy celebrity watering holes in recent weeks want to know if Lindsay Lohan, who's still underage, was served alcohol before a weekend car crash. California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control investigators also want to know if Lohan or others were served after hours, agency spokesman John Carr said. Videos show Lohan leaving Hollywood's Les Deux club at 3:30 a.m. Alcohol cannot be served in California after 2 a.m. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control told the Beverly Hills Police Department it wants to review witness reports and other evidence to determine if a formal investigation is warranted, Carr said. Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore said Lohan had dinner and wasn't drinking. "Because of the enormous paparazzi presence outside of Les Deux that night, we allowed her to stay late and wait for her friends," according to a statement released by Moore. Lindsay Lohan, right, shown here partying with her pal DJ Samantha Ronson, at Tokyo's Warehouse nightclub on April 12, 2007. Authorities are investigating whether the 20-year-old was served drinks at a Los Angeles nightclub before her car crash last weekend. Lohan, who turns 21 on July 2, was behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz that was heavily damaged when it crashed into a curb and bushes on Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills early Saturday. Lohan was arrested for investigation of driving under the influence. Her publicist announced the actress entered a rehabilitation facility on Monday. "We have a duty to check on these things whenever there's a report of a minor involved in a crash," Carr said, noting "underage drinking is a huge problem in the state of California." Some 1,574 people were killed in alcohol-related vehicle crashes last year and about 200 involved underage drinking. There have been 10 recent enforcement operations involving Alcoholic Beverage Control and Los Angeles police officers checking Los Angeles-area clubs, Carr said. The agency has four investigators in Los Angeles. Club Teddy's at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood paid a $3,000 fine on May 4 for accusations last year that it sold contaminated beverages and sold alcohol after hours, Carr said. Photos: Celebrity Mug Shots There's also a pending investigation now in the hearing process against Hollywood Boulevard's Club Mood, another popular nightspot for young Hollywood, Carr said. There are no pending ABC enforcement actions against Les Deux. "We do investigate any time we get complaints when someone underage is being served. Anyone under the age of 21 cannot be sold alcohol in California." If they do, Carr said it can result in a fine, suspension of the club's ABC license to sell liquor or revocation of its liquor license. © MMVII, CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Now she's catching heat over a joke party invitation she sent out. Nicole, whose anorexia and drunken driving are famous, asked pals to come "celebrate our country" on Memorial Day "by drinking massive amounts of beer." The invite instructs female guests to "start starving yourself" because "There will be a scale at the front door. No girls over 100 pounds allowed in." In Touch Weekly got hold of the invitation, and got boring old "experts" like Dr. to shake their heads and say "tsk, tsk." (This was, we now know, the party from which had to be rushed to a hospital, perhaps for celebrating her country too vigorously.) Now Richie's publicist is trying to save face, telling Us Weekly: "This invitation was sent via e-mail to her friends who understand that she was responding in a joking manner to the constant untruths printed about her in the media." WE SHOULD LOOK WHERE, DEAR? and other guests at a Dolce & Gabbana party in Cannes the other day. After some seriously funky dance moves, she told everyone to "look at my butt. I've got a great black girl's butt, kinda like I may be from Australia but I think I must have some blackness in me." Make Us Your Home Page © Copyright 2007 Sun-Times News Group |

Well the latest news is that Universal Studios have named it The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. This Harry Potter Theme Park will become part of Universalâs Islands of Adventure theme park and in the press release they said âThe fully immersive, themed land will enable guests to visit some of the most iconic locations found in the books and the films including the village of Hogsmeade, the mysterious Forbidden Forest, and even Hogwarts castle itselfâ. This is great news for all the Harry Potter fans around (that includes me), the J.K. Rowling books and films have inspired the Wizarding World of Harry Potter to happen because of such a big following that the series has gained. It will be late in 2009 when the new Harry Potter world will launch and it will feature interactive attractions (3D Like Attractions) and immersive rides, restaurants and experiential shops.

Go to a Section: 11:52AM EDT, Thu 31 May 2007 Messing magnificent in "Starter Wife" Wed May 30, 2007 9:25AM EDT Female action pics need heroes of their own It's "Happening" for Deschanel in Shyamalan movie Waitress set for stardom after Clooney sing-song Thompson says he'll run for U.S. president LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Debra Messing reportedly was determined to exorcise any trace of her "Will & Grace" character Grace Adler from her persona while shooting her mostly inspired (if a bit transparently shallow) new six-hour USA Network miniseries "The Starter Wife," and darned if she doesn't pull it off. Messing is magnetic and alluring in the adaptation of Gigi Levangie Grazer's best-selling novel inspired by her split -- temporary, as it turned out -- from high-powered Hollywood hubby Brian Grazer. The mini is about being shunted aside for a newer, blonder piece of eye candy and having to dig deep to find one's essence once the parties stop and the high-powered life itself divorces you. Messing is more than up to the task of bringing this social death to life, effectively erasing any memory of that job she used to have on that NBC comedy, whatever it was called. "Wife" is entertaining and bitingly irreverent, at once sweet and sour. It ropes you in because Messing is so adept at making us like her neurotic personage. If there is an abiding problem with the mini (and this isn't insignificant), it's that it actually is based on something of a flawed premise. It isn't a riches-to-rags story so much as a riches-to-riches. See, after Molly Kagan's (Messing) little weasel of a husband, Kenny (nice work from Peter Jacobson), dumps her to take up with young blonde bimbette Shoshanna (Trilby Glover), she isn't forced to take her daughter and share a one-bedroom apartment in Alhambra. She's allowed to stay in the beachfront Malibu Colony estate of a friend in secret rehab. So forget down-and-out; this is down-and-up. That friend, Joan McAllister (a spectacularly over-the-top turn by the exquisite Judy Davis), is seen as one of only two who doesn't abandon Molly in her hour of need. The other is her gay designer pal Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos). The message, apparently, is that one need be an alcoholic or a homosexual to be fully human -- though we know it's only a matter of time before Molly's best pal, Cricket Stewart (Miranda Otto), comes to her senses and stops shunning her. Than again, trying to scrutinize motives is fairly futile in "Wife." As demonstrated in the sassy, somewhat stereotype-riddled teleplay by Josann McGibbon and Sara Parriott, the five-parter (it kicks off with a two-hour and then plays for an hour over four subsequent Thursdays in June) is far more interested in being a lighthearted romp than a serious character study. Sometimes, however, those themes clash, the outrageous moments sometimes awkwardly intertwining with far more weighty themes. One of those is embodied in a big-time Hollywood mogul named Lou Manahan (smartly played by dependable Joe Mantegna), whose charismatic overtures draw Molly's romantic interest but whose demons lead him down a tragic path. This side journey is dismissed in an almost perfunctory way. Veteran director/exec producer Jon Avnet brings all of his lensing skills to bear here, shooting the project with assured flair and making his leading lady look ravishing even when she's dressing down. (To Messing's immense credit, she allows herself to appear frumpy at times and pokes fun at the whole concept of actress body-image issues.) This is like a good page-turner in that it's never less than energetic, witty and a kick to watch, though the depiction of Hollywood superficiality and excess is too broad and cartoony to make much of a larger point about female empowerment. It's more like, "I am woman, hear me whine." &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

On his second day as prosecution witness, Deputy Coroner Louis Pena reasserted the jury that the death was a homicide. When cross questioned by defense lawyer, Pena reaffirmed that presence of gun residue on the victimâs hand does not necessarily mean that she shot herself. He even explained how gun residue could drop on a person when heâs being shot by somebody, by putting his hands around his face and chest. "There are two ways to look at it. It implies the person could have been holding the weapon or been in the vicinity when the weapon was discharged," Pena said. He also told the defense lawyer that even the person who has the gun in hand may not have traces of gun powder after the shot. The prosecution witness disclosed that after examining Clarksonâs body he discovered bruises on her tongue, her right arm and hand which brings out a possibility that she was being threatened with a gun in her mouth and was under the pressure of her murderer. When cross questioned by the defense lawyer about the possibility of the presence of the bruise on the tongue due to the gunshot, the doctor answered that such occurrence was ânot normally seenâ. He also added that there was no way to confirm how fresh the bruises were considering the fact that Lana took a lot of pain medications. He also said that while collecting evidence they found large amount of Clarksonâs blood in the left pocket of Spectorâs pants which suggests that the gun had been placed in the pocket and was also wiped. Being asked to analyze the entire situation, Pena disclosed that he had a different picture of Clarkson in mind. All that he could gather from various sources about her is that she was a hopeful person and had no records of suicide attempts or depression. He also added that a suicide with purse on one shoulder at a strangerâs place was a rare possibility and it is a simple case of murder. "It bothered me a lot that she had her purse on her right shoulder," Pena said yesterday. "It's difficult for someone to take a weapon and shoot herself with the purse staying on her shoulder. It should be off." Defense attorney Christopher Plourd also asked him if there was a possibility that the handbag stayed on her shoulder due to a self inflicted wound. Pena confirmed the possibility but added that the circumstantial and physical analysis made him reach the conclusion that the death was a homicide. The defense attorney tried to shoot down the witnesses stand by saying that it was only once in the court that the forensic expert mentioned the significance of the purse and it was not mentioned anywhere in his reports or notes to which the doctor agreed but insisted that he mentioned it in a meeting once before. When asked about any mistakes that Penaâs team made during the investigation, he answered that one of his dental investigators lost one of Clarksonâs teeth which was kept in a vial. Pena was given a taped vial, which seemed to have been assembled after breakage and wasnât told about the incident for several months. "There were three vials collected to be examined by the odontologist," Pena said. "What happened is on review in meeting with the odontologist he admitted he broke one of the vials and the tooth fragment was lost. It flew around the room somewhere." He also told the jury that the dental investigator sealed the vial again but the fragment was never found. He also conceded that Clarksonâs body was moved in a wrong manner which caused blood to flow out of her mouth making it difficult to evaluate her dress for blood spatter. Forensic expert Henry Lee, was also under the doubt umbrella as a retired sheriff's investigator who worked for Spector's initial attorney told the court he saw Lee hold a piece of fingernail in a handkerchief at the time of inspection of the scene in an earlier hearing. The prosecutor confirmed the incident by showing the jury a photograph of the actressâs bloodstained right hand, which showed that part of her acrylic thumbnail was missing. According to prosecution this finding directly pointed towards a rift that must have happened between Spector and Lana before the killing. They also hinted that the defense hid the evidence to save their case. The defense lawyer cross questioned the doctor all morning and also asked a lot of questions on defense experts Vincent DiMaio and Werner Spitz, whose textbook Pena was consulting during the investigation. The testimony will resume tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Harvey Phillip Spector, 67, is accused of shooting actress Lana Clarkson, 40, through the mouth on 03 February 2003 early morning in his mansion. Spector who is presently free on $1-million bail, on the other hand claims that Lana committed suicide. Spector, 67, the American musician songwriter and record producer will face 15 years of life imprisonment if convicted of murder. Actress Lana Clarkson was famous for her notable performance in the movie Barbarian Queen. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

We&#39;re referring to Monday&#39;s competition, of course. Where usually a Miss Universe competition is an excuse for the world&#39;s most dumbly pretty bubbleheads to trot up and down a walkway and pretend that they&#39;ve ever had a single thought that wasn&#39;t exclusively about themselves in an attempt to win a big piece of ribbon, this year things were different. That&#39;s because this year , America&#39;s contestant in Miss Universe, fell over and was then booed relentlessly when she had to try and address the Mexican audience. The Miss Universe booing incident is now being played off as a political matter, based on the USA&#39;s draconian immigration policy - but that&#39;s missing the real point here. The real point, should you need telling, is that booing people who are prettier than you is probably the best thing in all the world. There must have been a point in time where a beauty queen was a genuinely aspirational thing to become. Not any more, though - the majority of women have either realised that beauty contests are nothing more than outmoded efforts to undermine female accomplishments in an ultimately patriarchal society, or they&#39;ve worked out that they can totally get a bunch more money if they fuck blokes on the internet for a living. That has left the beauty queen talent pool so shallow that even drunk nymphomaniac drug abusers like Miss USA Tara Conner can have a real shot at winning. Or, alternatively, people who can&#39;t walk down a simple piece of floor without falling over like a ninny, like Miss USA Rachel Smith. Rachel Smith represented the USA in Monday&#39;s Miss Universe contest. Obviously the biggest news about Miss Universe was that it was won by yet another Earth girl - Miss Japan - following last year&#39;s win by But while we&#39;d usually be taking this time to pass on our commiserations to all the other planets in the universe who have been cruelly shut out of the Miss Universe title again, this year we&#39;ve decided it&#39;d be much more fun to look at all the abuse that Miss USA Rachel Smith got from the crowd of Mexicans she was trying to impress. Rachel Smith&#39;s Miss Universe woes were twofold on Monday; not only did she fall over in front of everyone, but she also attempted to give a speech to an auditorium of angrily booing Mexicans. The treatment of Miss USA has kicked off a huge debate in America about whether Smith was booed because she&#39;s an idiot who can&#39;t even stand up properly or because she represents a country with strongly anti-Mexican immigration policy. Miss Universe co-owner thinks he knows the answer: "I don&#39;t think they are booing because of Rachel. They are booing because of the immigration policy." Following his statement Donald Trump then went into a 45-minute-long abusive rant about Rosie O&#39;Donnell because there was a camera there and that&#39;s what he just assumes people wants to hear these days. But, for all the ensuing arguments and self-exploration that the Miss Universe booing of Miss USA has started, perhaps the people of Mexico are onto something with this method of protest. We can&#39;t be alone in thinking that all international disputes would be better solved if pretty girls in bikinis from each country walked up and down a catwalk until everything was sorted out. Also, we think that Rosie O&#39;Donnell would probably be more in favour of the Iraq War if this was the case.

Maybe the soccer players were prettier than the fans in Mexico City when the chanted May 31st, 2007 at 2:08 pm You&#8217;re a fuckin loser dude!! Commenting on such a stupid event!! May 31st, 2007 at 2:17 pm This is old news. Show me a mexican that pays taxes and I&#8217;ll listen to his argument. Otherwise, go rake my lawn and plant my pagonias. Riyo Mori is smokin hot, go Asian! May 31st, 2007 at 2:20 pm What a cruel person you are, you so-called writer. Just because you can type and put some words together, doesn&#8217;t mean you should use them in order to put down another person, especially a person who is trying to do something in this world. There is absolutely no excuse for being lousy to people and that fact is lost on this writer, and those crummy Mexicans in the audience. We should not let those Mex&#8217;s into our country at all, let them wallow in their own feces. May 31st, 2007 at 2:20 pm The writer of this article is as anti-american as those in the Mexican audience booing Miss Universe. Regarding &#8220;bubble headedness&#8221; the writer should look in the mirror. May 31st, 2007 at 2:21 pm Ugly women,nasty men and shity beer,what would you expect form a bunch of low life third world idiots.fuck i say May 31st, 2007 at 2:28 pm Don&#8217;t mistake me for being anti-U.S., and I understand that a lot of Mexico is unfriendly to the U.S., but the problem wasn&#8217;t just political. The contest was in Mexico, but it was obvious that the show was a U.S. production. Ms. Mexico was excluded from the final five, yet Ms. USA, who had fallen on stage and was nowhere near as good looking as Ms. Mexico was advanced. The Mexican crowd saw a problem with the judges. Anyone who watched had to be scratching their heads&#8230; or booing. May 31st, 2007 at 2:54 pm &#8220;Draconian immigration policy&#8221;? What planet are you from? The US has the most liberal immigration policy of any nation on this planet! We accept more legal immigrants and tolerate more illegal immigrants than any other nation. You want draconian, look at f**king Mexico&#8217;s immigration laws. May 31st, 2007 at 3:07 pm Well, I for one was happy to read this. I&#8217;m SICK of Bush and his gang getting their own corrupt way in everything. I live in Okinawa where Americans are about as popular as a dead cat in a wedding. Why? Individual Americans are fine. Their politics is reminiscent of the 3rd Reich. In my opinion, the animosity has less to do with immigration policy than Herr Bush and his gang running over everything. Why does the &#8220;World Bank&#8221; have to have an American at the top? Americans invaded Iraq. Let&#8217;s not forget that. They started this war on what has since proved to be a pack of lies. I&#8217;m happy they didn&#8217;t win the beauty contest. There is no beauty there. May 31st, 2007 at 3:12 pm Obviously you have no concept of U.S. immigration policy nor what illegal immigration has done to the U.S. It is clear that you hate the U.S. May 31st, 2007 at 3:17 pm Your article is funny. I suspect you&#8217;re not intending this to be some grand discussion of US immigration policy, or foreign policy generally. It&#8217;s just meant be funny, and the responses make it even more amusing. Beauty contests and the U.S. are both ridiculous. May 31st, 2007 at 3:18 pm This article is perfect example of the bias in our media today. They try to make it appear that we are in the wrong about our immigration policy. They talk about all these poor mexican families. What they don&#8217;t tell you is the 33,000 gang mexican gang members that are illegally in the country, the California prisons that are bursting with illegal immigrants that have committed crimes or the fact the mexico promotes these people to come to our country so that they don&#8217;t have to provide social services for them. Instead we can pick up the bill! America is a country of laws and yet we provide get out of jail cards for people who arenât event citizens of this country? Your are anti-American. If you like Mexico then go live there! Wake up America!!!!! May 31st, 2007 at 3:22 pm its sad that people are still so ethnocentric. we believe that we as americans are so much higher than everyone including mexicans&#8230;and then we wonder why people around the world hate us so much&#8230;.. May 31st, 2007 at 3:26 pm Your obvious lack of knowledge, about the problems illegal immigaration are causing in the United States, is appaling. Please get a clue before you write anymore about things you obviously know nothing about. May 31st, 2007 at 3:34 pm Isn&#8217;t Rachel Smith part Mexican? I know she&#8217;s mixed, but don&#8217;t know what of. At any rate, &#8220;USA&#8217;s draconian immigration policy&#8221;,&#8221;strongly anti-Mexican immigration policy&#8221;???! Huh? What the heck are they talking about? They&#8217;re practically our special guests here in America. Sure, now that we&#8217;ve moaned and groaned about illegals they are doing some sort of token border patrol but it&#8217;s no where near where it should be. What about Mexicans immigration policy? Could I goto Mexico illegally and collect welfare, vote, deal drugs and demand citizenship? I don&#8217;t think so. Maybe we should have booed Miss Mexico for their draconian immigration policy. May 31st, 2007 at 3:45 pm The author, Stuart Heritage, seemed to miss his own point about the Miss Universe pagent. He shows contempt for the pagent, the contestants (especially Miss USA), Donald Trump, and the USA. For some reason thought he showed no contempt for the country that hosted the event, Mexico, or the people that payed money to be in the audience, mostly Mexicans. Mr. Heritage seems to have a problem with the objectification of women yet he feels no compashion for the women being objectified. I have always felt that the Mexicans in the USA are just here to earn a decent living and provide for there families and I have absolutly nothing against that. I have also believed that imigration is good for the USA, historically spikes in imigration have caused spikes in the economy. But this isn&#8217;t so for Mexican imagrants because they use and abuse our system and our generosity. I know why President Bush wants to keep the status quo but why is it that liberals want to maiintain Illegal imigration. Do they truly believe we should open our borders to anyone that wants to come into the USA. Is there a single country in the world that does that, I don&#8217;t think so? Since this debate has started I have been shocked at the hateful comments of Mexicans and it is they that have formed my new opinion. Screw them they are ungreatful America haters and all illegals should be tossed out and required to come back legally. Or maybe they should clean up there own house first. If it wasn&#8217;t for the rampant corruption in Mexico it wouldn&#8217;t be a third world country anymore. That says something about the Mexican people and it isn&#8217;t good. I was in Mexico once and had to bribe the immigration officer to get in the country because he ripped up my perfectly good visa and demanded a bribe. I had to bribe a cop to leave me and my wife alone when all we were doing was having a meal in the same restuarant that these DRUNK police officers decided to come into. The owner also gave them a case of beer so that they would leave. Then I had to bribe another immigration officer to let me out of Mexico. They have made their country a shit hole and I think they should have to live in it.

May 31st, 2007 at 3:51 pm I aggree with Paul - I&#8217;m not anti-american, but don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s fishy how the USA alwyas happens to run in the top 5 ?? out of how many other women?? PLEASE!!! and they saw how the AMreICAN pageant, put our USA lady in the top 5 after she tripped yet MISS MEXICO didn&#8217;t make it and she walked without falling. So, if they booed because it&#8217;s political, then i say, why not? i don&#8217;t blame them. May 31st, 2007 at 4:00 pm Typical liberal ranting is all i got out of this little piece of crap article.And as far as the guy from Okinowa is concerned, you really should do a little checking of history in lets say the last 60 years. You do know that the Japanese have a history as some of the most brutal and racist people to ever walk this planet. I think all you have to do is look at what they did throughout asia and the south pacific prior to ww2. Brutal to say the least.As far as your histrionics about the Bush administration are concerned the &#8220;lies you speak of were accepted as factual by the world and the united nations. Do your homework and try to operate withsome intellect and not so much on emotions. People will take you allittle more seriosly May 31st, 2007 at 4:05 pm Great article/column, especially for its ability to bring out so much political rancor from so many of your readers! I agree with &#8220;Paul&#8221; that the audience was booing the judges&#8217; decision to allow a less pretty (and pretty clumsy) Miss USA into the finals while excluding Miss Mexico. I also agree with Julia Goulia that your column was very funny; I laughed out loud a few times. It&#8217;s too bad so many of your readers can&#8217;t recognize sarcasm & satire.

The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, sold Wednesday to a private European buyer at Christie&#039;s sale of film and entertainment memorabilia. The auction house said it had expected the dress to sell for up to $30,000 (&#8364;22,000). "The sale was filled with iconic pieces," said Helen Hall, Christie&#039;s head of entertainment memorabilia. "It captured people&#039;s imagination." Hall said the auction house was pleased with the results of the sale, which brought in $1.2 million (&#8364;890,000). Other items on the block included Marilyn Monroe&#039;s script for "Something&#039;s Got To Give," with the actress&#039; handwritten notes, which sold for $19,200 (&#8364;14,300). A program from President John F. Kennedy&#039;s birthday celebration that featured the actress at Madison Square Garden went for $66,000 (&#8364;49,000).

Reilly, one of the few openly gay performers of his generation, died of complications from pneumonia at a Los Angeles hospital overnight on Friday, Dawn Altyn, a spokeswoman for the actor's one-man show said. Reilly's health had been declining for about a year, Altyn said. He was 76. He last performed his autobiographical show, "Save It For the Stage: The Life of Reilly" in 2004, and a filmed version of the show is due to be released to theaters in October. Reilly won a Tony Award in 1962 for his role in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" and was nominated again in 1964 for "Hello, Dolly!" and in 1997 for directing "The Gin Game." He also received multiple Emmy Award nominations over his five-decade television career, but it was his lengthy turn as a game show panelist on "The Match Game" and "Hollywood Squares" that made him a pop culture fixture. The bespectacled, pipe-smoking actor cruised the edge of 1970s TV propriety with his double-entendres about his openly gay persona. He later speculated that being a game show panelist had hurt his acting career. He also was known for his roles in the 1970s in two children's programs, "Lidsville" and "Uncle Croc's Block" and the TV series "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir." In the early 1990s, he directed several episodes of the TV series "Evening Shade," and in the past few years performed the voice of The Dirty Bubble for the hit cartoon series "SpongeBob SquarePants." The Bronx-born Reilly is survived by his longtime partner, Patrick Hughes. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

The split screen pushed her over the top - what kind of lame ass excuse is that ?? Oh and by the way Ro - did Joy defend your "who are the terrorist" comment ?? I don't remember that... why didn't you call her a coward ?? Because she is your Democrat buddy, huh??? You have truly gone over the edge and I hope I never see your mug on TV again.

The agreement, announced Wednesday, came after an extensive auction attracted interest from private equity investors and Universal Music Group, The New York Times reported. Sony-ATV is a partnership between Sony and the singer Michael Jackson. Famous Music, Viacom's worldwide music publishing division, is a publishing catalog with rights to roughly 125,000 songs, ranging from "Moon River" to " Hips Don't Lie." Its stable of songwriters include Akron and Shakier. Viacom, which operates cable channels such as MTV and Nickelodeon, put it up for auction after concluding the catalog wasn't a core asset. Famous' catalog also includes film scores, such as themes from "The Godfather" and "Beverly Hills Cop." Viacom took over the business as part of its acquisition of the Paramount movie studio. Sony has been in the market for publishing catalogs, which generate income when their songs are used in television shows or films, played on the radio or recorded.

But I love the movie so much, I decided to do a couple of follow-up questions with him during the recent junket MGM held in honor of the film. In the movie, Costner plays a man addicted to killing. He even goes to AA meetings to curb his appetite for destruction. Here's what else he had to say about his character... Why the decision to do something so dark and sinister? : The decision was pretty simple. I thought the writing was the star of the movie. And while I didn't see myself like that person, I thought, "I could do this." Even though you have to professionally cover movies, I'm sure deep down you love movies and probably love movies when they surprise you. On paper, I thought this movie had all of those moments if we embraced them and went for them. I understood that it would be seen as a departure. I understood all of the things that would come with it, but I still felt like, "If I'm going to make a life of making movies, then I should try to make different movies." And this seemed to fit in a positive way. Did you ever think about directing : I thought about that, but when I realized what the pedigree of the project was, and that the writers who wrote it wanted to direct it, we had a discussion about that. I could've done that, but in this instance it was important for Evans to direct. I've worked with a lot of first-time directors and writer-directors, and I thought, "I'll give this a chance". You always knew that you were going to be a producer? : I knew that. I knew that without a doubt I would have [to produce]. I also knew that I would have to have final cut on it because the... odd things about the movie I knew would be the things that would be cut first. If you don't like blood, blood would be gone. If you don't like "this", "this" would be gone. They ask audiences, "What do you like?" "I don't like this." But I thought that this piece was dark. It's insidious, even though we find ourselves laughing at some moments - the oddity of it. I felt that it needed to be true to itself. And if no one else wanted to make this movie and I wanted to make it, why would I let anybody try to flatten in out and make it more generic? So while I know some longtime [fans] who've enjoyed my movies might be offended by this, might think it's too harsh... I get that, and I accept that. But I don't want to cater to my audience; I just want to feed it. Take it or not take it. It's an honest effort. Were you familiar with Dane Cook's standup before working with him in this? : I wasn't familiar with his standup, and I'm actually glad because I don't completely understand his standup. (Laughter) But I understand him, and I understand his desire to not be pigeonholed or be conformed. He read for me. He read for this movie. He did all the things that someone who has a bigger idea about their career does. That's why he got the part. And he was sensational in it. Do you think there's a little bit of Mr. Brooks in yourself? : The things that we all see in Mr. Brooks are that we would all go defend our daughter, that we would go kill for them. Mr. Brooks isn't looking for forgiveness. "Don't you see that I'm a nice guy?" No, he's not. He has a disease. When that disease isn't working, he is a nice guy. But the families that he's dismantled, both the ones that have died and the boat wake that comes after, that kind of thing where families are destroyed forever... we don't really deal with that. That's why we can't ever forgive him. But where Mr. Brooks is successful, I think, is that it creates a certain kind of empathy. And empathy always comes in our life when we have a level of understanding. You may not like the serial killer, may never forgive him, he destroyed your girlfriend's life forever. You might know him, and know that he was assaulted and abused since he was three-years-old. You can't forgive him then either, and you can't say anything to her, but in your heart you go, "That poor fucker never had a chance". You have empathy because you have a level of understanding of him. In movies, we can create a level of understanding if we choose to invest in the character, and that's what made Mr. Brooks stand out to me as a serial killer movie. Because I don't like serial killer movies; I don't like scary movies. I get scared. I don't like roller coasters and shit like that. I don't like being scared. It's not an adrenaline rush for me. So Mr. Brooks really had to pass a lot of things for me to even want to be a part of it. And it did. Were you ever afraid that the character of Marshall would dominate the movie? : I knew it was a really flashy role, and I very often take movies that have scene-stealing roles all around me. And I relish that. I think it's important for movies, and I don't get scared by that stuff. I encourage the actors to be really good around me. I want that to happen, and I want them to do it inside the lines of the movie. So when I see a great role, I want to go after a great actor. A great actor recognizes a great role. It raises the level of the whole movie. William Hurt has a pleasing role, and sometime the temptation in American movies now, the conventional wisdom is that they'll ask you what scenes you hated the most. Then they'll ask you what scenes you liked the most. In modern day filmmaking, that scene that you hated the most will go flying out of the movie, but that doesn't mean it should've. It gives the movie a balance. They might ask you about characters, and you'll say, "Well, I really like Marshall the most." Then the executives go, "Let's write some more scenes for Marshall!" I think Marshall is in there just perfectly. Just perfectly. How was it playing opposite William Hurt. : It was fun. I've known William because of . We're both rehearsal oriented actors, and writer-driven actors. It fit into our game really nicely. Is Marshall based on a person from Mr. Brooks' past? : Yes. I found Marshall when I was twelve-years-old in a book of children's dreams, and he would play the black knight, an evil person. But I liked him in the book because he was kind of cool. I liked him so much that I was afraid he was going to die in the book, so I never finished it. And my father used to discipline me with the idea that, if I wasn't good, the black knight would come and get me, that he actually hid in my closet. And like any young man, I eventually challenged my dad's theory and opened that closet, and there was my imaginary friend. And he was not scary at all to me. So he's been with me as my alter-ego. Bruce Evans had directed only one film prior to . What did he do to convince you that he could accomplish this visually? : Well, I didn't look at his other movie. I didn't want to because, once I committed to him as a director, I wanted to try to support him, and I didn't want to get panicked. I mean, I'd heard different things, but I didn't want to jade that. Once I gave him my word that he would get a chance to direct it, I wanted to back that up. But I also wanted to protect the movie with final cut. What do you look for when you're reading scripts? : Just fresh air. Just something that seems highly original. I would never do this movie it was pitched to me. But I would never have done if it was pitched to me. It takes a writer that really has his muse working on his shoulder, and you go, "Wow, this is an incredible window they've found into this subject." For instance, I thought was great. The window into that story was Kenny O'Donnell, not Jack's point of view or Bobby's point of view. It's hard to write. It's an art form. When you write, where do you look for inspiration? : It just comes to me. I don't consider myself a great writer, but I feel like I recognize a great idea, and I feel like I protect great writing. I think that's my talent. In that sense, do you think great writing isn't respected in Hollywood? : I don't think it is. The minute you're willing to ask an audience what they think about the movie, then nobody cares about the writing; you care what [the audience] thinks. But unlike conventional wisdom, I don't go out and make a movie when the script is sixty-percent just because I got the actor and the director and I think the job's done. I'm anal. I don't go out to actors until my script is 100% done because I don't want anybody changing it. Annette Bening and Robert Duvall didn't change a line on . Why? Because I was sure that it worked. William Hurt, Dane Cook and I... we didn't change any lines in our half of the movie because I was positive it worked. Yeah, there's blood. There's a lot of blood. That's what this movie was about. But there's a lot of tenderness, too. What is everybody so afraid of? Not being number one at the box office? Well, we aren't going to be. We're not even going to be close. But we can be a movie that's so true to itself that you might want to take a friend back to it. Or you might never want to see it again because of what it is. But it might speak so loudly to somebody, they'll tell a friend "I want you to see this movie." And I'm proud that those elements are in there that would drive you back to it. I think it has classiness. Can you say anything about the western you're working on now, and will you be using the same editor from : I'll probably use the same guy. It's just a good cowboy movie. It's about friendship. There's a code. It's written; it's 100-percent done. I'm not sure... people aren't dying to make westerns. I'll just have to figure out how to make it. I'll have to mortgage something else. (Laughs) Do you think there's a killer gene as posited in this movie? : I don't really know. You hear about alcoholism being passed on, and genes and stuff like that. I think we're a generation that's just learning about what gets passed on. Our eyes are opening every day as to what... I mean, just about the time we think a protein diet is the right one, somebody goes, "So wrong!" Every diet, somebody's like "Wrong!" four years later. There's too many of us in the city. There's too many of us... look, it's weird out there. We're all like some number. One out of somebody gets assaulted, and women have it worse. It's like, "What the fuck?" We're like a percentage of something going bad somewhere. It's terrible. Are you surprised that Brian De Palma is going back to make an prequel, and do you have any thoughts on Nicolas Cage playing Al Capone or who should play Malone? : No. I don't think about it at all. I think about it now because you brought it up. It was a seminal film for you. : It was a very important film to me, and it was very important to Brian. I'm not surprised that they've circled back to it to squeeze some more out of it. opens nationwide on June 1st.

( Paramount Pictures France) &#039;Knocked Up&#039;: Rowdy, sad and very funny By A. O. Scott Published: May 31, 2007 Directed by Judd Apatow (U.S.) It may be a bit, um, premature to say so, but Judd Apatow&#039;s "Knocked Up" strikes me as an instant classic, a comedy that captures the sexual confusion and moral ambivalence of our moment without straining, pandering or preaching. Like "The 40 Year Old Virgin," Apatow&#039;s earlier film, it attaches dirty humor to a basically upright premise. While this movie&#039;s barrage of gynecology-inspired jokes would have driven the prudes at the old Hays Office mad, its story, about a young man trying to do what used to be the very definition of the Right Thing, might equally have brought a smile of approval to the lips of the starchiest old-Hollywood censor. The wonder of "Knocked Up" - which is being released Friday in the United States and in Asia and Europe beginning in July - is that it never scolds or sneers. It is sharp but not mean, sweet but not soft, and for all its rowdy obscenity, it rarely feels coarse. What it does feel is honest - about love, about sex, and above all about the built-in discrepancies between what men and women expect from one another and what they are likely to get. Starting, as he did in "Virgin," from a default position of anti-romantic cynicism, Apatow finds an unlikely route back into romance, a road that passes through failure and humiliation on its way toward comic bliss. This improbable - and improbably persuasive - love story is embedded in what looks at first glance like a nest of sitcom clich&#233;s. The central would-be couple, Ben and Allison, represents the kind of schlub-babe pairing seen more frequently on television than anywhere else. Tall, blond and lovely, Allison (Katherine Heigl) has just been promoted to an on-air job at the E! cable network when she meets Ben (Seth Rogen) at a nightclub. He is a pudgy, unkempt stoner who lives with a group of goofball pals. Their ratty communal apartment doubles as the headquarters of their nascent Internet enterprise, a Web site that will collect and catalogue movie scenes in which famous actresses appear naked. But Ben is friendly and unpretentious, and it does not entirely defy belief when Allison, beer goggles firmly in place, takes him home to bed. Or, rather, to her sister&#039;s house, where she sleeps in a spare room. The sister, Debbie (played by the brilliant Leslie Mann, Apatow&#039;s wife), is on hand to send darts of envy and disapproval in Alison&#039;s direction, and also, along with her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), to incarnate both the ideal and the nightmare of heterosexual domesticity. Debbie is relentlessly critical, Pete is emotionally withdrawn, and together they dwell in a paradoxical state in which fulfillment - two charming young daughters, a big house with a pool, each other - seems indistinguishable from disappointment. A rare glimpse of 19th-century Iran For Lohan, a mix of sympathy and scorn Kiefer: An artist with monumental force There is, as I&#039;ve suggested, a certain familiarity to much of this. But Apatow has a sly way of subverting these familiar touchstones. When one of Ben&#039;s sperm hits the reproductive jackpot, the stage seems to be set for a comedy of male panic. But that&#039;s not quite how "Knocked Up" plays. Rather than being afraid of commitment, Ben appears fascinated by the idea. When he learns that Alison has decided to keep the baby, he seems genuinely delighted. Alison is somewhat more hesitant, not about the incipient child, but about staying with Seth, whose hold on maturity is less sure than his grip on his favorite bong. What Alison doesn&#039;t realize - partly because he doesn&#039;t quite either - is that Seth wouldn&#039;t mind changing, if only he could figure out how. At a moment of crisis, Seth calls his father, played by Harold Ramis, to ask for advice, but no help is forthcoming. ("I&#039;ve been divorced three times. Why are you asking me?"). The absence of a credible model of male adulthood is clearly one of the forces trapping Seth and his friends in their state of blithe immaturity. Apatow&#039;s critique of contemporary mores is easy to miss but it is nonetheless severe, and directed at the young men who make up the core of this film&#039;s likely audience. The culture of sexual entitlement and compulsive consumption encourages men to remain boys, for whom women serve as bedmates and babysitters. I realize that much of what I have said about it makes "Knocked Up" sound like a pretty heavy picture, pregnant (sorry!) with seriousness and social significance. But since the birth of the talkies, the best American movie comedies have always managed both to confront grave matters and to defy their own gravity. In this case the buoyant hilarity never feels weighed down by moral earnestness. Apatow lingers in his scenes long enough to show that what is funny can also be sad, and vice versa. "Knocked Up" made me smile and wince; it made me laugh and almost cry. Above all, it made me happy.

Fox's unscripted Hollywood competish "On the Lot" bowed in its regular timeslot Monday night to a fifth-place finish among the broadcasters. After failing to ignite much interest with a pair of preview episodes last week -- including one following the final "American Idol" performance show of the season -- the search for the next great film director settled for fewer than 3 million viewers. Of course, Memorial Day isn't a great night to kick off a series, and Fox can hope that its audience grows from here. But the net could be forced to yell "Cut!" if numbers remain at this level -- which are low even by summer standards. Based on preliminary same-day Nielsen nationals for Monday, "On the Lot" averaged a 1.3 rating/4 share in adults 18-49 and 2.9 million viewers overall from 8 to 10 p.m., peaking with about 3.1 million from 8:30 to 9. Those numbers left the net behind repeats on CBS as well as firstrun programming on ABC, NBC and Univision; Fox also may have trailed a cabler or two in the 9 o'clock hour. Show's regular airing pattern is an hour on Monday, followed by a "box office" results show Tuesday. Elsewhere Monday, ABC's new limited-run series "Ex-Wives Club" (prelim 2.0/5 in 18-49, 5.3 million viewers overall) placed third at 9 o'clock, airing behind a slot-leading original episode of "Wife Swap" (prelim 2.3/7, 6.3 million). This repped a slight improvement over last year's "How to Get the Guy," which bowed on a Monday in June. NBC's coverage of "The Miss Universe Pageant" settled for a prelim 2.4/7 in 18-49, and 7.1 million viewers overall from 9 to 11 p.m. -- down 25% from last year's July airing and believed to be the pageant's lowest numbers in at least 20 years. It didn't get much help from its lackluster lead-in -- an original episode of reality series "The Real Wedding Crashers" (prelim 1.5/5 in 18-49, 4.1 million). With firstrun fare struggling on other nets, CBS cleaned up by claiming the top three programs of the night with repeats of "Two and a Half Men" (prelim 3.4/9 in 18-49, 10.7 million), "The King of Queens" (3.0/8, 8.8 million) and "CSI: Miami" (2.9/8, 9.4 million). Due to the Monday holiday, the primetime ratings report and charts for the week of May 21-27 will appear in Thursday's edition.

http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117965939.html%3Fcategoryid%3D13&cid Variety.com - 'Pirates' treasure grows overseas Blog: Wilshire & Washington Blog: The Down Low Cynthia Littleton On The Air Variety On The Town Smith: In New York Posted: Tue., May 29, 2007, 4:37pm PT 'Pirates' treasure grows overseas Film's domestic tally dipped by $2.2 million 'Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End' The treasure chest for Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" turned out to be fuller than expected when actual receipts from the Memorial Day holiday weekend were counted Tuesday. But while international B.O. edged up -- by $6 million, or 2% -- the pic's domestic tally dipped by $2.2 million. All told, global figures eked up 0.8% higher than the Mouse House had estimated, bringing the latest entry in the "Pirates" franchise to $404 million over six days rather than the $401 million the studio reported Monday. Mark Zoradi, prexy of Walt Disney Studios Motion Picture marketing and distribution, said the uptick showed "Pirates" has "truly becoming a cultural phenomenon all over the world." "The global box office returns have continued to exceed our expectations and estimates," he added. Pic's perf has been particularly pumped by its overseas grosses, which account for 62% of the worldwide total. With that figure at $404 million, "Pirates" beat out the $382 million that "Spider-Man 3" earned over its first six days in release. But back here at home, "Pirates" numbers didn't completely live up to some of the outsized expectations of B.O. watchers handicapping Memorial Day weekend. Domestically, the movie's actual take was somewhat less than studio estimates: "Pirates" played to $139.8 million over the four days of Memorial weekend, Disney said, rather than $142 million. Pic still handily set the record for the Memorial Day frame, beating Fox's "X-Men: The Last Stand," which cracked $122.8 million last year. Overall domestic cume -- including limited Thursday runs of "Pirates" -- was $153 million, rather than the $156 million Disney estimated Monday. By comparison, "Spider-Man 3" opened to a three-day record of more than $151 million and has captured $307.6 million after a month in theaters. Internationally, "Pirates" set an overseas launch record with $251 million over six days, $19 million ahead of "Spider-Man 3" and up notably from Disney's $245 million estimate. Pic posted record-breaking openings in 17 territories, including Argentina, Ecuador, Holland, Iceland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, Panama, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine and Venezuela. Germany contributed significantly more than had been estimated Monday, with an increase of nearly $3 million to $22.9 million, trailing only the U.K. with $34.5 million. Other top hauls abroad came from France ($22 million), South Korea ($19.3 million), Japan ($18.4 million), Russia ($15.4 million), Spain ($13.2 million) and Australia ($10.5 million). "At World's End" still hasn't opened in two key markets -- India, where it launches Friday, and China, where it opens June 10. Sony took issue Tuesday with Disney's claim of a six-day record, asserting it should be counted as seven days, since BVI opened "At World's End" a day earlier than reported in France and Italy on May 22. BVI said in response that its "Pirates" biz on that day consisted of $1.2 million at 251 playdates from evening showings in France and $200,000 from previews in Italy. Still, Sony asserted "Spider-Man 3" should be given the record for grossing $418.1 million in its first seven days.

Sifting through the Lohan gossip may be kind of difficult, especially with her dad Michael Lohan's recent reports about his daughter's habits. But throughout all of dad's remarks, there may be some valuable information, especially regarding the exact drugs that are hurting Lindsay. Michael Lohan, in a discussion with today, said that Lindsay's addictions are primarily for alcohol and the painkiller OxyContin, surprising information given the recent media attention on the 20-year-old's cocaine and ecstacy binges. "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care," he said. "I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things." In the wake of Lindsay's car accident, the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is now investigating whether Lindsay, still underage to legally consume alcohol in the U.S., was served by bartenders. Perhaps the investigation is a little late, given the notorious underage drinking problem in America, but better late than never to start enforcing the law. Talk to other readers about this story.

News - Silver Surfer Coin Not So Fantastic - Jessica Alba Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News rise of the silver surfer Silver Surfer Coin Not So Wed, 30 May 2007 10:57:23 AM PDT They wanted unique. They got illegal. Not content to simply resign their promotions for Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer to the usual breakfast cereal and skywriting variety, the marketing brains at 20th Century Fox went outside the box&mdash;and, as it turns out, the law&mdash;and ingratiated the Silver Surfer onto some 40,000 U.S. quarters. Unfortunately, they forgot to tell the U.S. Mint. Fox first announced the unprecedented marketing move last week and unveiled the limited-edition coins to the press. While the front of the quarters, and George Washington&#39;s visage, remained unaltered, the reverse featured a full-color image of the Silver Surfer character, with the URL for the film&#39;s Website. The coins, which were distributed 800 per state prior to the Memorial Day weekend, were meant to encourage fans who found the quarters to log on to the site and enter to win prizes, including a trip for four to the film&#39;s London premiere. Unfortunately, the illegal tender&#39;s artwork, while creative, was carried out by the Franklin Mint without the cooperation, or even awareness, of the government, a point the U.S. Mint was quick to lambaste. "The promotion is in no way approved, authorized, endorsed, or sponsored by the United States Mint, nor is it in any way associated or affiliated with the United States Mint," the government said in a statement. The feds said they didn&#39;t know about the promotion until contacted by the media. While Fox has copped to launching the campaign without government approval, the studio maintains that it was unaware such sign-off was necessary. The studio released its own statement saying it did not intend to break the law or "suggest that there was any approval from the U.S. Mint or the U.S. government." The Franklin Mint, too, said it didn&#39;t mean any harm, calling the Silver Surfer quarters "commemorative coins like many the Franklin Mint creates on a regular basis for various properties. We were confident this coin followed the same procedures and guidelines but will certainly take any necessary steps if advised otherwise." It is a federal crime to turn any form of legal tender into a form of advertising, and violators can face a fine. Then again, the $10,000 in Silver Surfer coins that were distributed throughout the country, along with whatever fine may be assessed, will no doubt be less than what it would cost to generate the same amount of headline-grabbing publicity that the criminal coins have.

http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_6022447&cid Press-Telegram - Starting over By David Kronke, Staff Writer Article Launched: 05/31/2007 12:00:00 AM PDT GIGI LEVANGIE Grazer, the wife of Oscar-winning ber-producer Brian Grazer, knows a little bit about the pretensions and snippy mores of the privileged Brentwood crowd and has shared them with the world in her three novels about Hollywood. Her latest, "The Starter Wife," has now been made into a miniseries premiering tonight on the USA Network. In it, Debra Messing stars as Molly (the character was named Gracie in Grazer's novel, but Messing had already played a fairly iconic character named Grace), whose oily studio-executive husband dumps her for a newer model, spouses serving essentially as status accessories in Hollywood. He also gets custody of most of her friends - those who want to work in the industry again, that is. Decamped to a pal's home in Malibu, Molly must figure out how to reinvent herself and start a new life. Despite airing Tinseltown laundry, Grazer says, "I've somehow managed to stay friends with everyone. I'm not looking to destroy anyone. I do it with affection, by telling the truth, and believing people can improve ..." She pauses, a beat worthy of a comedian. "Much to my eternal disappointment." In fact, after each book, Grazer says acquaintances seek her out to share anecdotes potentially worthy of being incorporated in future works. "After my last book, a woman came up to me, scandalized - her husband was dating a 40-year-old woman from the Valley!" she reports with a mock shudder, then laughs. "That was the worst thing she could say about her." Jon Avnet, who directed "The Starter Wife," says, "Gigi has written a very good book that makes fun of people that I like and people that I don't like - and myself, as well." Grazer conceived "The Starter Wife" when she spied a woman recently divorced from a big star on a beach in Malibu, flirting with a hunky guy that Grazer knew was homeless. "I thought, `That's a novel.' " "It was sophisticated and the comedy was subversive, a little perverse, a little mocking of, you know, the Hollywood culture," notes Messing, who adds that there's something rather precise about the Hollywood wife. "I encounter them every single day in Los Angeles. There are high expectations for the wives of the power brokers, and there is a kind of look to the starter wife. There's the polished hair and the beautiful nails and the designer clothing and the white teeth and the, you know, very trim body." Of her character, Messing observes, "There's something very universal about what Molly goes through. It's incredibly painful seeing a woman who was so successful in her life as a partner and wife to this incredibly successful man and everything she contributed to his success, to be just discarded and to have all of the respect that had been hers with him sort of walk away with him. All the issues of identity and choices made - `Where am I going, and am I going to have a chance to do it again?' " Sad reality Grazer agrees that although the book and miniseries are set in Hollywood, their emotional core has a wide appeal. "I don't want to keep it just to Hollywood wives," she says. "It's a very real thing that women can go through - being dependent on the man they're with, financially dependent, socially dependent. There's a very real fear. I see it in my own life with people I know. It's a terrible thing to have to live with." Though Grazer receives an executive producer's credit on "The Starter Wife," she did not seek to work on the screenplay (that task went to Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon, whose big-screen credits include "Runaway Bride" and "Chicken Little"). Grazer, who reportedly wasn't enthused about her own foray into screenwriting ("Stepmom"), jokes about the devotion needed for such an enterprise. "Six hours of television - do you know how many meetings that translates into? How many trips on the 405?" she says, with a laugh. "Also, I have small children. You have to work too hard. I'm working on my next novel. I like my three-hour workdays." More seriously, she says, "Handing over your baby is fine if you hand over to people qualified to take care of it. And they were uniquely qualified. My ego was beaten out of me a long time ago in terms of protecting my writing. "I wasn't worried - and had good reason not to be. When I got the first draft of the first hour, I was immediately on board. They got the tone, and it's a difficult tone - it's light, it's airy, it's feminine, but the undertone is dark and questioning of the world we live in. And there are satirical bits and pieces - well, they're not satirical if you live in my neighborhood. I'm happy with the outcome. There'll be no lawsuits coming from me." Grazer's next book, due next spring, is titled "Queen Takes King," about another power couple divorcing. But her friends hoping - or fearing - to see themselves as doppelgangers in her next novel can rest easy - this one is set in New York. As for Messing's next project, well, after eight years on "Will & Grace," she's not anxious to be nailed down to another TV series anytime soon. "I just knew I needed some time to be a gypsy, as much as I absolutely loved having that job. I really am enjoying being able to wake up in the morning and not having to be anywhere and not having to do anything. Having that freedom is really wonderful, and it's revitalizing for me right now."

"The plans I have seen look incredibly exciting and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed," Rowling said of the Orlando park that is scheduled to open in 2009. The park is a joint venture between Warner Bros Entertainment, whose Potter films have so far grossed more than $3.5 billion (1.77 billion pounds) worldwide, and Universal Orlando Resort. In a statement rich in entertainment hyperbole, the builders of "The Wizarding World of Harry Potter" said they planned to "create the world's first immersive Harry Potter themed environment." Barry Meyer, chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment, said: "Over the years we've received thousands of letters from fans around the world wishing they could visit Hogwarts (School) and the wonderful locations described in each of J.K. Rowling's beloved stories." The park's opening could help to quell the withdrawal symptoms of Potter fans around the globe who have bought 320 million copies of her wizard tales and turned every one of the films into a box office hit. Pottermania is set to scale new heights in July with the last novel hitting the bookstands and the latest film being launched in a deluge of global publicity. "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," the final instalment in her hugely successful series, is being released on July 21. &copy; Reuters 2007.

And if you're one of that select segment of Hollywood society known as "wife of," the primary accouterment is your powerful husband -- preferably a producer, though a director may have to suffice. These are women who tweeze, squeeze and wax themselves into submission in order to marry into money, fame, power -- and, apparently, the mean girls' table at the best lunchrooms in town. Debra Messing, with Joe Mantegna, plays a Hollywood woman scorned in USA network's sudsy summer miniseries. (By Paul A. Broben -- Usa Network) Tune in to the shows coming to airwaves this summer with our premiere calendar. Save & Share Article But it's a precarious existence. Lose that man, and you might as well stop flat-ironing your hair. Fortysomething Molly Kagan (played by Debra Messing) learns this after she gets dumped by her power-producer husband via speakerphone and finds out that divorce, Hollywood-style, comes with a lot more than property settlements and custody battles. Suddenly, she's being shunned at six-figure children's birthday parties, can't get a table at the right restaurants and is no longer welcome at charity event-planning powwows. The twist behind "Starter Wife" is that it's based on a novel by a woman clearly poking fun at her own universe: Gigi Levangie Grazer, "wife of" Hollywood titan Brian Grazer. She somehow managed to satirize those around her, get a bestseller out of it, and not end up a starter wife herself. With Messing as the lead and the fabulous Judy Davis, martini glass in hand, playing one of her inner circle, the casting far exceeds the bar for a summer cable miniseries. And the slick skewering of Hollywood's foibles is quite fun . . . for a while. Alas, the story takes a quick detour and becomes something akin to "Desperate Housewives" living in "The O.C." Molly flees to a borrowed Malibu manse for the summer. From that point on, the plotlines head straight for the suds. A potential murder! A wacky attempt to spring a friend from rehab! A new potential love interest with a murky past and no platinum credit cards (to put it mildly)! Peter Jacobson plays Molly's soon-to-be-ex, the kind of guy who thinks it's perfectly fine to screen "Jaws" for his 5-year-old right before she goes to live at the beach. He's already replaced Molly with pop-tart Shoshanna (Trilby Glover), much to his starter wife's horror. Besides Davis, Molly's pals include Miranda Otto as Cricket, who truly has a heart of gold (a fact we're supposed to know from the start because she has a Brangelina-like brood of adopted children). Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos), a gay interior designer, completes the foursome. Diamantopoulos isn't great, but then again, when your subplot involves trying to unload a set of ugly chairs, there isn't much to work with. It's talents like Messing (who is more likable and less shrill here than she was in "Will & Grace") and Davis who save this six-hour miniseries from disaster. Not that the network doesn't do its best to drive viewers away with abundant (and abundantly annoying) product placement. A drinking game that required viewers to take a shot every time a brand-name item is blatantly mentioned would be lethal. We'd list some of the offenders here, but they're already getting their two seconds of fame. And the major tie-in with a particular line of beauty products that are supposed to keep us looking younger? Talk about a reverse effect. All that cringing it induces can't be good for the crow's feet. Then again, it's kind of nice to see a summer beach cast with a few crow's feet of their own. airs its first two hours tonight at 9 on USA Network. It continues over the next four Thursday nights.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Fri, May. 25, 2007 Boy Bags Hog Said Bigger Than 'Hogzilla' In this photo released by Melynne Stone, Jamison Stone, 11, poses with a wild pig he killed near Delta, Ala., May 3, 2007. Stone's father says the hog weighed a staggering 1,051 pounds and measured 9-feet-4 from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. If claims of the animal's size are true, it would be larger than ``Hogzilla,'' the huge hog killed in Georgia in 2004. (AP Photo/Melynne Stone) MONTGOMERY, Ala. - Hogzilla is being made into a horror movie. But the sequel may be even bigger: Meet Monster Pig. An 11-year-old boy used a pistol to kill a wild hog his father says weighed a staggering 1,051 pounds and measured 9 feet 4, from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. Think hams as big as car tires. If the claims are accurate, Jamison Stone's trophy boar would be bigger than Hogzilla, the famed wild hog that grew to seemingly mythical proportions after being killed in south Georgia in 2004. Hogzilla originally was thought to weigh 1,000 pounds and measure 12 feet long. National Geographic experts who unearthed its remains believe the animal actually weighed about 800 pounds and was 8 feet long. Regardless of the comparison, Jamison is reveling in the attention over his pig. "It feels really good," Jamison said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. "It's a good accomplishment. I probably won't ever kill anything else that big." Jamison, who killed his first deer at age 5, was hunting with father Mike Stone and two guides in east Alabama on May 3 when he bagged Monster Pig. He said he shot the huge animal eight times with a .50-caliber revolver and chased it for three hours through hilly woods before finishing it off with a point-blank shot. Through it all, there was the fear that the animal would turn and charge them, as wild boars have a reputation for doing. "I was a little bit scared, a little bit excited," said Jamison, who lives in Pickensville on the Mississippi border. He just finished the sixth grade on the honor roll at Christian Heritage Academy, a small, private school. His father said that, just to be extra safe, he and the guides had high-powered rifles aimed and ready to fire in case the beast, with 5-inch tusks, decided to charge. With the animal finally dead in a creek bed on the 2,500-acre Lost Creek Plantation, a commercial hunting preserve in Delta, trees had to be cut down and a backhoe brought in to bring Jamison's prize out of the woods. It was hauled on a truck to the Clay County Farmers Exchange in Lineville, where Jeff Kinder said they used his scale, recently calibrated, to weigh the hog. Kinder's scale measures only to the nearest 10, but Mike Stone said it balanced one notch past the 1,050-pound mark. "It probably weighed 1,060 pounds. We were just afraid to change it once the story was out," he said. The hog's head is being mounted by Jerry Cunningham of Jerry's Taxidermy. Cunningham said the animal measured 54 inches around the head, 74 inches around the shoulders and 11 inches from the eyes to the end of its snout. "It's huge," he said. "It's just the biggest thing I've ever seen." Mike Stone is having sausage made from the rest of the animal. "We'll probably get 500 to 700 pounds," he said. Jamison, meanwhile, has been offered a small part in "The Legend of Hogzilla," a small-time horror flick based on the tale of the Georgia boar. The movie is holding casting calls with plans to begin filming in Georgia. Jamison is enjoying the newfound celebrity generated by the hog hunt, but he said he prefers hunting pheasants to monster pigs: "They are a little less dangerous."

Annina Ulrich admits that since childhood she has been obsessed with enhancing her assets, but claims her boss did not understand that. According to the buxom 29-year-old her boss told her that "breast implants were not an asset and were damaging the company's image," even though customers apparently thought they were "great."

The centuries old tradition attracted participants from around the world, many of whom sustained injuries while in pursuit of a 7-8 pound Double Gloucester. According to three-time champion Jason Crowther, of West Wales, "[i]t was a bit slippery and I heard something crack, which I think was my knee ." Winners take home the wheel of cheese they were chasing, with $20 and $10 going to second and third place respectively. Softer conditions may have been responsible for the low number of serious injuries this year, with volunteer EMTs treating only 20 wounded chasers, compared to 34 last year. eBay Steal of the Week : For those of you in the market for a car with a really great story eBay is offering the actual hearse that carried President John F.

It is also interesting that you feel the need to take a direct slam against Christianity. Then again, maybe you are not aware that Muslims, Buddhists, Hebrews, ... well just about all religions worship "God". You need to be a little more careful. Either your bias or your stupidity is showing.

Posted by: Mort | May 30, 2007 06:27 AM SoMD you're right. Randy Jo, you're wrong. If you want to be really technical about it, Christians believe in the Trinity - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit - nowhere is the word God found in there. Also, read this definition of God: 1 capitalized : the supreme or ultimate reality That pretty well seems to cover any belief, whether associated with religion or not, that can exist. God does not mean Christian. It's merely the English word for a concept that has existed in every civilization since the dawn of time. Mort - you're just plain stupid. Allah, Yahwe, Adonai, Krishna...etc. - they ALL mean God, just in different languages. God, the word by itself, as I showed above, carries no connotation of Christianity, merely an understanding that there is something greater than ourselves. Hell, you can even believe in God by the name of God if you don't belong to any religion at all. SoMD supported what he said, while you just throw a meaningless comment out there with no explanation as to your bitterness and religious affront to the word God. Posted by: Little Bull | May 30, 2007 09:58 AM I cant believe you guys are arguing about the god reference ... im pissed that there was no picture of the German chick with huge boobs. Posted by: Ned Mark | May 30, 2007 10:04 AM Actually Little Bull, your full of it. "God" is English for a Christian entity, that is why it is capitalized. It specifically refers to God, not Allah, or Krishna or Yaweh or, as it should, the concept of god generally, but the God of the Holy Bible. Judaism, for instance expressly prohibts the writing of Yahew's name, therefore it is at the very least anti-semetic. Further, no other faith calls the entity they worship God, therefore are dictionaries are slanted by a Christian interpretation. In order for the phrase to be religiously sensitive to all (except of course atheists) it should read: "In a higher power we trust" Posted by: Squatting Bear | May 30, 2007 10:48 AM This is so funny. I'm unsure how anyone who is from the United States of America can question whether or not God when capitalized refers to a Christian God. This country was certainly a haven for extreme or different versions of Christianity from our onset. We have always been majority Christian (argue whether catholics or mormons or mennonites or whomever is Christian later) and therefore the conscious acceptance of God as a reference to the Christian God can only be the correct assumption. Personal politics cannot change facts as they are seen by the majority. The Framers were Christians, and they believed in "God" so think about it for a few minutes and I'm sure you will realize what the coinage is actually implying.

"On the Lot," the new Fox reality series executive-produced by Spielberg and reality show guru Mark Burnett, is proving to be a bust for the network. It debuted May 22 with an audience of 7.6 million, despite the 25-million-viewer lead-in provided by the final performance show of "American Idol." Its second airing on Thursday dropped to 5.2 million, losing nearly half of its lead-in. Steven Spielberg wants to give aspiring filmmakers the chance of a lifetime through "On the Lot," which is far from a blockbuster in the ratings game. (By Gerard Burkhart For The Washington Post) Save & Share Article This week, things got worse for the series in which aspiring filmmakers try to impress celebrity judges with their self-directed mini-movies in hopes of winning a development deal at Spielberg's DreamWorks studio. Monday's and Tuesday's shows averaged just 3.5 million viewers. Despite the low numbers for "On the Lot," Fox claimed victory in last week's Nielsen ratings race thanks to the final two episodes of "American Idol." Although the series lost viewers overall from past seasons, the final performance and result shows averaged 25.3 million and 30.7 million viewers, respectively. Fox also debuted the third season of the dance competition series "So You Think You Can Dance" last Thursday. Its audience of 9.5 million won the 8 p.m. time slot, but was down more than 1 million from last May's premiere. Some notable season finales last week: ABC's "The Bachelor," in which Andy Baldwin chose Washington native Tessa Horst, drew 12.7 million viewers, its most watched telecast since the May 2004 finale; Fox's "24" drew 10.3 million, its second smallest finale in six seasons; NBC's "Heroes" audience of 13.4 million was off about 1 million from the show's season average; and ABC's "Lost" on Wednesday garnered 13.9 million, 4 million below last year's finale. Meanwhile, no one seemed to notice that the Aaron Sorkin drama "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip" was back on the air. Only 3.9 million viewers caught Thursday night's return episode on NBC. But, Tom Selleck still has it. His Tuesday night movie "Jesse Stone: Sea Change" on CBS managed to pull in nearly 14 million viewers despite competition from the "Dancing With the Stars" finale, with an audience of 23 million. The top 10 programs, in order, were: Fox's Wednesday and Tuesday "American Idol"; ABC's Tuesday and Monday "Dancing With the Stars"; CBS's "NCIS"; ABC's "Lost"; CBS's "CSI"; NBC's "Heroes"; CBS's "Jesse Stone: Sea Change"; and ABC's "The Bachelor."

So what glamorous indulgence is this member of the industry elite, married to hotshot producer Brian Grazer, interrupting for an interview about the TV adaptation of her book "The Starter Wife" that's airing this week? Turns out Grazer is on her cellphone and in her car, parked down the street from a home where one of her two sons, the seven-year-old, is enjoying a play date. This undated photo, provided by USA Network, shows actress Debra Messing as Molly Kagan in the six-part miniseries "The Starter Wife," debuting on USA at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday, May 24. (AP Photo/USA Network, Paul A Broben) Email to a friend "I'm like skulking around, making sure he's OK. It's ridiculous," she says, with a laugh. "This is the most well-adjusted kid .... Obviously, the mother's not so well-adjusted." A relentless satirist, Grazer doesn't cut anyone - herself included - any slack. And she delights in brushing shoulders with the grasping, self-absorbed types who are part of the entertainment capital and her work. "Hey, I don't mind those people because I get to write about them. Bring on the bad behaviour!" Grazer said. Her printed candour hasn't led to tense confrontations, she said; quite the opposite. "I actually had more people coming up to me, especially after this book, because they saw people that they knew in it." Grazer said. "And I'd think, 'But you're on page 32.' They would give me more information that I didn't ask for, like who their husband was sleeping with." "It just comes down to people want attention, and they'll take positive attention or negative attention," she said, adding with a laugh: "I feel like God put me here." "The Starter Wife," her 2005 bestseller, is the basis of a six-part miniseries debuting 9 p.m. EDT Thursday on USA Network. It runs through June 30. Debra Messing ("Will & Grace") stars as a studio boss' wife who is abruptly edited out for a younger woman and, in turn, is shunned by her social circle. Lose your status, lose your life, Molly Kagan learns - and maybe find yourself. It's a realistic depiction of the industry's social mores, said writers and executive producers Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon. The longtime writing team's movie credits include "Runaway Bride." "We knew two people who were in a Hollywood marriage that broke up and knew she was off the list," McGibbon said. "Only one of them was going to (top agent) Ed Limato's Oscar party and it was the more famous person, even though she herself was a producer." Grazer's novel has a caustically comic edge that was eased for the miniseries, the pair said. Characters and subplots also were added to expand the story. "The book is more cynical, and when we tried to put that in the screenplay it wasn't likable: A billionaire woman becoming a millionaire," McGibbon said. "We had to make her more identifiable to any woman who was dumped because she's no longer what the guy wants and she has to start her life over again." John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

The young hunter is not accused of doing anything illegal, but the head enforcement officer for Alabama's wildlife agency said agents are trying to determine if anyone broke a state law prohibiting the transportation and release of live feral swine. "There are some questions about where the animal came from, how he got there, how long he'd been there," said Allan Andress, enforcement chief for the Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division. Andress said officials also will review whether the hunt complied with the state's "fair chase" law, which requires that prey at hunting plantations have a reasonable chance of escape. Eddy Borden, the owner of the spread where the hunt occurred, declined comment on how the hog got into the 150-acre fenced-in area where it was killed last month by Jamison Stone of Pickensville. Borden said he was getting tired of questions about the hog, which Jamison's father said weighed 1,051 pounds and measured 9 feet, 4 inches from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. The kill drew international attention. "I didn't ask for the publicity. I just want it to all go away," said Borden, whose Lost Creek Plantation is located in east Alabama. Keith O'Neal, one of the guides who accompanied Jamison and father Mike Stone on the paid hunt, said he was unsure if the super swine was placed in the enclosure or grew up it. Jamison was hunting with his father and the guides on May 3 when he killed the giant pig. He said he shot the huge animal eight times with a .50-caliber revolver and chased it for three hours through hilly woods before finishing it off with a point-blank shot. Mike Stone said neither he nor his son did anything wrong. "It's an 11-year-old boy who went hunting," said Mike Stone. "He was enjoying all the attention at first, but it's all getting old." Andress said there is nothing illegal about a child hunting in Alabama.

Famous Music was founded in 1928 to publish music from movies and owns the themes to many films including "The Godfather" and "Beverly Hills Cop." Earlier information had indicated the deal would involve assumed debt, but Sony/ATV spokeswoman Lisa Gerphardt said that would not be the case. Famous Music is being acquired by Sony/ATV Music Publishing, a joint venture formed in 1995 between Sony and trusts set up by Michael Jackson. It is not part of Sony BMG Music Entertainment, a business that combines the music operations of Sony and BMG, a unit of the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann AG. Sony/ATV Music Publishing owns or administers more than 500,000 copyrights by artists including The Beatles, Beck, Joni Mitchell and Roy Orbison. Viacom owns cable networks such as MTV and VH1 and the Paramount movie studio. Famous Music was its only property in the music business. Famous Music's roster of songwriters includes Shakira, Akon, Linda Perry and others. Through its Extreme division, Famous Music also supplies recordings and musical compositions for use in television and radio advertisements, film and television productions, trailers, and major network and cable broadcast promos.

The agreement, announced Wednesday, came after an extensive auction attracted interest from private equity investors and Universal Music Group, The New York Times reported. Sony-ATV is a partnership between Sony and the singer Michael Jackson. Famous Music, Viacom's worldwide music publishing division, is a publishing catalog with rights to roughly 125,000 songs, ranging from "Moon River" to " Hips Don't Lie." Its stable of songwriters include Akron and Shakier. Viacom, which operates cable channels such as MTV and Nickelodeon, put it up for auction after concluding the catalog wasn't a core asset. Famous' catalog also includes film scores, such as themes from "The Godfather" and "Beverly Hills Cop." Viacom took over the business as part of its acquisition of the Paramount movie studio. Sony has been in the market for publishing catalogs, which generate income when their songs are used in television shows or films, played on the radio or recorded.

Showbiz | Thursday, 31 May 2007 SKIN THIN: Nicole Richie told friends that no one who weighed over 45kg would be allowed into her Memorial Day party in an email her publicist called 'a joke'. What the Kiwi gossip mags say Richie refuses to visit sick mum Nicole Richie told friends no girls who weighed more than 45kg would be admitted to her Memorial Day party. The Simple Life star emailed pals inviting them to a party on Sunday, May 28, urging them to starve themselves because there would be weighing scales outside. But a representative for Richie says the email was "a joke". Nicole - who has been plagued by eating disorder rumours - wrote: "My fellow Americans it's that time of year - to celebrate our country by drinking massive amounts of beer. "Let's stand together as one, live the American dream. Take shots, pass out, and wake up with our pants ripped open at the seams. "Let's glorify this day in your sluttiest tops and your tightest pair of Tsubi jeans. Even though we have no f***ing clue what Memorial Day really means!! "There will be a scale at the front door. No girls over 100lbs (45kg) allowed in. Start starving yourself now. See you all then!!!" One guest, Mischa Barton collapsed at the party and was hospitalised after mixing alcohol with antibiotics. The bash was held at "Masha's" house - a pseudonym for Nicole's friend Paris Hilton. However, Nicole's representative has insisted she was joking in the email and didn't want anyone to not eat. The rep' said: "This invitation was sent via email to her friends who understand that she was responding in a joking manner to the constant untruths printed about her in the media. "Her reference to Memorial Day was in no way meant to offend anyone but was simply an expression of her distaste for the current situation." On her way home from the party, Nicole was involved in a minor car accident while driving rocker boyfriend Joel Madden's BMW. The 25-year-old - who is currently awaiting a court hearing on a charge of DUI (driving under the influence) - stopped at a gas station on the corner of La Cienega Boulevard and Holloway Drive in Los Angeles, where she backed into another customer's Honda convertible. Witnesses said Nicole was mortified and went to "hug it out" with the other car owner.

Jamison Stone and his prized pig. An 11-year-old Alabama boy caught in the center of a humongous hog controversy denied his monster kill was staged Wednesday in an interview with FOXNews.com. "I just want to say it&#8217;s not fake," said Stone made news last week when the world learned of his massive kill, a 1,051-pound feral hog, which he shot eight times with a pistol on a hunting preserve in eastern Alabama. But the young man soon found himself in a media maelstrom when some Web sites questioned the veracity of the photographs. "He did kill that pig," the boy's father, Mike Stone, told FOXNews.com. "Those pictures are not doctored." Jamison, who recently completed the sixth grade at Christian Heritage Academy in Carrollton, Ala., shot the pig on a hunt May 3 at the in Delta, Ala., with a .50-caliber revolver. His story made national news and the family traveled to New York to talk about their adventure, but blogs soon claimed to be able to prove the photos were faked. Photo of Monster Hog Called Into Question; Web Site Claims It Was Doctored Alabama Boy Kills 1,051-Pound Monster Pig, Bigger Than 'Hogzilla' "No pictures have been touched," the 11-year-old said. "They first were saying I couldn&#8217;t shoot the gun, but I could and I did." What should have been a moment of fun in the spotlight for a middle schooler became a nightmare, with some bloggers asking Mike Stone to take measurements of his son's skull to prove his claims, he said. "Before we got to New York this was a feel good story, everybody was excited about it," Mike Stone said. "And now all of a sudden my family is suffering because people are making fun of it and thinking that it's not real." After Jamison bagged his pig May 3, the Stones took their prize to the Clay County Farmers Exchange in Lineville, Ala., where it weighed in at 1,051 and measured approximately 9 feet 4 inches. In the heat of the moment, Mike Stone said, they snapped a few photographs for family and friends to share Jamison's moment of pride. "We would have took pictures of the scales, we would have took pictures of us measuring it, we would have took pictures of all the stuff if we would have thought this was going to be some big deal," Mike Stone said. Jerry Cunningham, owner of Jerry's Taxidermy in Oxford, Ala., said the feral hog was one of the largest he'd seen. "They&#8217;re about as twice as big as the normal pig," Cunningham told FOXNews.com. "Five-hundred pounds is big, giant. Most of them that come in to be mounted are between 150 and 250." On Tuesday night, Cunningham showed Jamison the hog's mounted skull. Mike Stone, who stresses to his family the importance of hunting for food, had the rest of the humongous hog made into breakfast sausage. &#8220;We gave a lot of it away ... some of them are going to use it at church fundraising breakfasts, some of them are going to use it for school fundraising breakfasts," Mike Stone said. "We actually do have two big freezers completely full." The boy's pig adventure is documented on , where the response from the public has been about 85 percent positive, Mike Stone said. "Regardless of what the negative e-mails say, we're not ashamed of the fact that we actually hunt," Mike Stone said.

Tell a friend by email Tell a friend by AOL Instant Messenger This Ain't No Jive This Ain't No Jive Is Justin Timberlake going out on a limb forming a new label at Interscope, instead of his recording home Jive, or is Interscope taking the real risk by creating a costly new venture in the face of declining record sales? Says JC Chasez: ''&#91;Timberlake's&#93; going to bring a lot of heat, because the world is staring at him right now.'' Justin Timberlake considered partnering with any number of major labels while shopping for a home for his Tennman Records imprint. So why did he ultimately go with Interscope Records and not, for instance, Jive, where Timberlake has been signed as an artist since his teen years in 'Nsync? ''The thing that ultimately made the decision for him,'' Timberlake's longtime manager Johnny Wright explains to EW.com, ''was the labels that &#91;Interscope&#93; already had and the people who were running them. Timbaland has a label there, Pharrell has a label there, will.i.am has a label there. If &#91;Justin has&#93; a synergy with these producers and writers, why not be there?'' (A representative for Jive confirmed that Timberlake is still on their roster but declined further comment.) Still, with profits from CD sales continuing to plummet industry-wide, there are clear risks for any label that decides to launch a costly new project like Tennman. Wright declined to discuss the deal's financial terms, but as one top industry insider comments: ''To be in business with Justin Timberlake, one of the biggest stars in the world, isn't cheap. It puts too much pressure on the deal.'' Tennman president Ken Komisar &#151; former VP of A&R for Sony BMG &#151; concedes that any start-up imprint faces steep challenges, but he believes Timberlake's successful track record as an artist and, more recently, as a writer and producer for other acts, can bring success to the new label. ''Someone who has the creative vision that he has &#151; it doesn't take all the risk away, but it certainly helps to make the odds a little better.'' Former *NSync bandmate JC Chasez, who enlisted Timberlake's production and songwriting skills for several tracks on his forthcoming sophomore album, , points out that Timberlake's status as an international megastar doesn't hurt either. ''Obviously, he's going to bring a lot of heat, because the world is staring at him right now,'' Chasez says. ''He brings free press with him wherever he goes.'' But does the 26 year-old have the business acumen to run a label? Nate ''Danjahandz'' Hills, Timbaland protégé and co-producer of number-one Timberlake singles ''SexyBack'' and ''My Love,'' says he witnessed the star's marketing savvy first-hand. '' 'SexyBack', he knew it was risky for him,'' Hills says. ''He knew he didn't sound like himself and he'd been gone for a while.'' Nevertheless, Timberlake fought to have the song released as 's first single. As Jive CEO Barry Weiss told EW back in February, ''It was an unusual record, but it was a risk that clearly paid off.'' It remains to be seen whether Timberlake will sign artists that will approach his level of success, and it might be a while before we find out. ''We're in a short-term business right now,'' says the insider. ''He wasn't walking in with an exciting, brand-new artist. It could be another two years before a record comes out &#91;on Tennman&#93;.'' A senior executive at another label is cautiously optimistic about any new venture headed by a recording artist: ''Justin himself is a tremendous musical force, so there's no better person to get in business with. But it's tougher than ever now to break an act. The key ends up being, can he pick and identify great talent? We've all known superstar artists who've gotten labels and not been able to pick talent and others who could.'' Timberlake has yet to announce any signees to Tennman (the name's a nod to his Tennessee roots). Says Wright, ''He just doesn't want artists that are sitting around waiting for Justin to come in and write a song or Justin to tell them what direction to go in. He wants artists that he's proud to do a duet with &#91;or&#93; put on his stage.'' Recent Internet speculation suggests his first artist could be Dutch teen and online sensation magazine reported that Denters' popular YouTube performances had attracted frantic attention from a host of major labels. In her most , Denters covers Timberlake's ''What Goes Around... Comes Around'' &#151; complete with a surprise cameo from Timberlake himself. Though no one in Timberlake's camp would confirm or deny any plans to sign Denters, Wright confirms that the star has talked with the teen and is ''definitely interested'' in working with her. Hills recalls, ''&#91;Justin&#93; was like, `She's crazy! I definitely want to get in the studio.' '' He was just excited about getting in with her and doing some music.'' Adds Komisar: ''&#91;Denters&#93; is hugely talented. We've all seen &#91;her talent&#93; unveil itself on YouTube, and you see the strength and power she has on her own. We'd be very lucky to work with her.'' If Timberlake can bring his Midas touch to Tennman, it's Denters who'd be the lucky one.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/30/entertainment/e111253D54.DTL&cid Judd Apatow: Comedian Behind the Camera Judd Apatow: Comedian Behind the Camera By JAKE COYLE, AP Entertainment Writer Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (05-30) 18:44 PDT New York (AP) -- At a recent Q&A following an advance screening of the riotous comedy "Superbad," a woman in the audience asked the film's producer Judd Apatow if he makes "romantic comedies for men." "That sounds like product &#8212; or a lube," replied the 39-year-old filmmaker. Apatow, the director of "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" and the new "Knocked Up," acknowledged such a label wasn't far off the mark, but said he doesn't think much about categorizing what he does. Besides, he said, "Isn't there love in every movie?" A classification like "romantic comedies for men" also doesn't do justice to other staples of Apatow's work &#8212; namely, an endless barrage of filthy jokes, cleverly delivered. And yet Apatow's comedy always maintains &#8212; as Seth Rogen, the star of "Knocked Up" and a frequent collaborator of Apatow's, says &#8212; an "oddly sweet" quality. Thanks to the huge success of 2005's "The 40 Year-Old Virgin," Apatow has broken through to the mainstream after a career that has spanned contributions to some of the most critically acclaimed comedies of the past 15 years &#8212; from "The Ben Stiller Show" to "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy." With the Friday release of the eagerly awaited "Knocked Up," it's clear he's become a behind-the-scenes ringleader to a thriving era of comedy that revels in mixing the dumb with the smart, the bawdy with the sincere. "I'm trying to figure out how to get gigantic laughs without losing my reality level," the wry, bearded Apatow explained over lunch at a recent interview in New York. "That's always the dance." Even as a teenager, Apatow was at the center of comedy. For his high-school radio show on Long Island in the mid-`80s, he managed to interview Jerry Seinfeld, Howard Stern, the original writers of "Saturday Night Live" and many others. "I really met EVERYBODY over the course of two years," Apatow recalls. "I would just ask them how they did it. It was an excuse to spend an hour asking: How do you write a joke?" Apatow later moved West to study screenwriting at USC, where he dropped out within two years thanks, in part, to a free trip won on "The Dating Game" &#8212; a comic twist in Apatow's biography worthy of one of his films. As a struggling standup, he lived with Adam Sandler and began writing jokes for other comedians, eventually writing for Roseanne Barr. His first and only attempt to work in front of the camera was quickly scuttled after a trip to an acting coach. "It was the worst acting anyone has ever done," says Apatow. "At that moment, the dream of comedian becoming actor died. I folded my cards immediately." Rejections by "Saturday Night Live" and "In Living Color" followed, but then he met Ben Stiller. Apatow executive-produced "The Ben Stiller Show" (1992), the short-lived but acclaimed Fox sketch show that spawned the careers of a myriad of comedians, including Stiller, David Cross, Bob Odenkirk and Andy Dick. "In a lot of ways, that's where everything started," says Apatow. "People connect the dots and see all the people I've worked with, but really, it all comes from Stiller." He then wrote for five years on HBO's "The Larry Sanders Show," eventually becoming an executive producer. The show's star, Garry Shandling remains a mentor. Like the dialogue of "Knocked Up," Apatow's speech is riddled with pop-culture references. He grew up obsessed with the Marx Brothers and Steve Martin, watched Woody Allen films endlessly, considers Harold Ramis' movies ("Caddyshack,""Groundhog Day") "a gigantic influence" and found inspiration in the mix of humor and realism in films like "Terms of Endearment" and "Fast Times at Ridgemont High." To Apatow, his greatest achievement is "Freaks and Geeks," the beloved cult favorite hour-long TV series that ran for only one season in 1999-2000. The show, created by Paul Feig and executive produced by Apatow, was followed by another acclaimed but canceled series: "Undeclared." "In a way, the movies are an extension of those TV shows," says Apatow. "Some people have been saying, `Do you feel like the reason these movies ("Virgin,""Knocked Up") are doing OK is because your work is getting better?' And I'm always like, `No, I don't think I'll ever make anything as good as "Freaks and Geeks."'" The lack of commercial success on the small screen led Apatow to concentrate on producing film projects, including a number of Will Ferrell films: "Anchorman,""Kicking and Screaming" and "Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky and Bobby." "He obviously has this unique talent of someone who can make what would probably be classified as a broad comedy, but yet he's finding ways to deal with these real issues that we all face," says Ferrell. "He's tackling them in ways we haven't seen before." The box-office success of "Anchorman" helped Apatow get backing for "Virgin," his directorial debut, which he co-wrote with Steve Carell. "It gave me a career path," he says. "The beginning of my career was mainly about helping my friends execute their ideas, which was really fun but it wasn't based on my personal point of view." "Knocked Up," also written by Apatow, is very personal for him. Though the film &#8212; in which Rogen plays an immature pothead who has parenthood thrust upon him after a one-night stand with a far more professional woman (Katherine Heigl) &#8212; isn't directly autobiographical, the issues of facing adulthood are familiar to the director. Further, much of Apatow's life can be seen on screen. His wife, actress Leslie Mann, co-stars; their two young daughters play her character's children; Ramis symbolically plays a wise father to Rogen; and a good number of the actors from his past TV shows and movies have notable parts or make cameos. Mann, whom Apatow met while working on the Jim Carrey movie "The Cable Guy," says that while everything in "Knocked Up" has been reflected against a "funhouse mirror," much of it is culled from their relationship. For example, the scene where Allison (Heigl) boots Ben (Rogen) from the car while driving to the gynecologist was taken directly from an argument of theirs. Frequently working with his close-knit troupe of friends and actors, Apatow's style is heavy on improvisation and collaboration. The famous "You know why I know you're gay?" running bit in "Virgin" was improvised, and "Knocked Up" provides a similar gag based on a setup of "You look like..." to describe an extremely hairy character (Martin Starr). A recently released two-disc DVD edition of "Virgin" includes footage of Apatow relentlessly shouting new lines to his actors as they riff their way through a scene &#8212; a method he calls "rewriting while the cameras are rolling." Apatow also holds numerous screenings of early cuts of his films for filmmaker friends in hopes of garnering feedback. "What really sets him apart is just how collaborative he is, and how confident in yourself you have to be in order to be collaborative and take ideas from your actors and your friends," says Rogen, who was a teenager when Apatow cast him in "Freaks and Geeks." "Knocked Up," which was completed in February, arrives in theaters on a sizable wave of buzz, aided by very early screenings to critics and press. As a relatively low-budget film starring the little-known Rogen, it's a film that needs substantial word-of-mouth to compete with summer blockbusters. The low-cost, laugh-heavy approach has proven appealing to studios; "Virgin" grossed $109 million at the box office on a production budget of $26 million. "Knocked Up," rated-R like "Virgin," is also in the same budget range and was well received by Universal Pictures, Apatow says. "They may have just been happy that I didn't ask for triple the budget and robots," he deadpans. Another key to his success is that he's largely been able to keep creative control of his films. Mann says he passed on numerous films before making "Virgin." Now, after years of unsold scripts pilling up, Apatow's projects are getting the green light. Besides "Superbad," this year will also see the release of another Apatow production, "The Pineapple Express," which was written by Rogen. Next year will be "Walk Hard," a mock biopic in the style of "Ray" starring John C. Reilly and "You Don't Mess with the Zohan," which Apatow co-wrote with Sandler. "It's almost more than a Jew from Long Island can handle," Apatow says of his good fortune. "All my assumptions about myself are confused when people like the work. On some level, it's almost more comfortable for it to go the other way." Get up to 50% off home delivery of the Chronicle for 12 weeks!

Click to view a larger picture On the Tube / By Alan Pergament Pergament: First-class casts elevate two female-centric series Updated: 05/31/07 8:10 AM It&#8217;s the time of year that the networks trot out laughable, uplifting reality series like ABC&#8217;s &#8220;The Ex-Wives Club&#8221; that belong on cable while cable trots out scripted shows like &#8220;The Starter Wife&#8221; and &#8220;Army Wives&#8221; that belong on network television. &#8220;The Starter Wife&#8221; premieres at 9 tonight with a two-hour movie on USA Network, one of the cable channels owned by NBC&#8217;s parent company. The six-hour series has subsequent hour episodes on four straight Thursdays. It stars and is narrated by Debra Messing (&#8220;Will & Grace&#8221;). She plays a desperate, thin housewife, Molly Kagan, whose life is shaken after her powerful Hollywood husband, Kenny Kagan (Peter Jacobson) &#8212; a small man in more ways than one &#8212; coldly tells her via a phone message that he wants a divorce. Needless to say, it&#8217;s a comedy about pain and superficiality that is based on a best-seller by Gigi Levangie Grazer, the wife of Hollywood producer Brian Grazer. Molly not only loses her husband, but also her entree into the Hollywood scene. She also loses friends who are more worried about their husbands&#8217; career mobility than helping an old friend deal with a lifechanging crisis that makes Molly question whether she should have enjoyed life by eating more for the past 12 years. &#8220;I am so stopping for a burger and fries on the way home,&#8221; she says after learning she is on the road to divorce. The cast includes Judy Davis as one of Molly&#8217;s true friends, Joan, an alcoholic who lets Molly live in a beach house while she is off in detox playing a therapist for a fool. Chris Diamantopoulos is Molly&#8217;s gay friend, Rodney, who also stands by her. Joe Mantegna is a thrice-divorced Hollywood executive, Lou Manahan, who is tired of making movies for 14- year-olds and of dealing with all the fake characters he&#8217;s met over the years. Supportive of Molly, he tells her: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure how your story ends.&#8221; Molly also has some new struggling friends. Anika Noni Rose stars as Lavender, a goodhearted security guard with financial problems who takes care of her mother. Stephen Moyer is Sam, a hunk with a mysterious past who lights Molly&#8217;s fire even after she discovers a secret about him that makes him considerably less than a big catch. But at least he&#8217;s true to himself while living an unglamorous life, which makes him practically unique in Hollywood. In the first four episodes made available for review, the name-dropping script by Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon takes advantage of Messing&#8217;s appeal and ability to do zany. Davis could do her dryly comic role in her sleep and Mantegna is his usual solid self. Directed by Jon Avnet, the series also has several increasingly annoying fantasy scenes in which Molly imagines herself in old movies like &#8220;The Wizard of Oz.&#8221; Hollywood cliches abound and the material becomes so repetitive that I&#8217;m not even sure I care to find out how Molly&#8217;s story ends in the final two episodes. Check that. If it means avoiding one of NBC&#8217;s endless reality shows this summer, then I&#8217;m all for finishing &#8220;The Starter Wife.&#8221; The new Lifetime series &#8220;Army Wives,&#8221; which premieres at 10 p.m. Sunday, also has a network pedigree. It is produced by the ABC Television Studio. Lifetime also is partially owned by ABC. Mark Gordon of &#8220;Grey&#8217;s Anatomy&#8221; serves as one of the executive producers. &#8220;Wives&#8221; has some similarities to &#8220;Grey&#8217;s&#8221; in that it focuses on the love lives of mostly traditional married couples, often set to melancholy music. The couples live on an Army post while the Iraq War is going on, giving it some of the same resonance of &#8220;Over There,&#8221; the Steven Bochco series that aired on FX. The casting also is of network quality. Kim Delaney (&#8220;NYPD Blue&#8221;) stars as Claudia Joy Holden, the loving wife of a Col. Michael Holden (Brian Mc- Namara). Catherine Bell (&#8220;JAG&#8221;) also is aboard as Denise Sherwood, the devoted wife of a major (Frank Serpico) who keeps a secret from him. Brigid Brannagh plays Pamela Moran, a wife who tries to keep a family secret from everyone. However, the most compelling character &#8212; Roxy LeBlanc, a sexy, naive and street-smart Southern mother of two who is married to an enthusiastic paratrooper &#8212; is played by a lesser known actress, Sally Pressman. This being Lifetime, it isn&#8217;t surprising that the female characters make a stronger impression than the male ones. The men include Sterling K. Brown as Roland Burton, a psychiatrist unsure how to deal with his wife, Lt. Col. Joan Burton (Wendy Davis), when she struggles after returning from a tour in Afghanistan. Drew Fuller also stars as Roxy&#8217;s romantic and principled husband, Trevor. The first three episodes of the series, based on a book by Tanya Biank, introduce the characters and the difficulties they face &#8212; post-traumatic stress, domestic abuse, financial stress and the anxiety of having loved ones whose lives are in danger daily. There also are political games being played by some wives and some dissent from the teenage children who are being raised in a judgmental world where it is &#8220;my way or the highway.&#8221; Thankfully, there also is some humor, because at times the plots are a little heavy-handed.

An MGM release of an Element Films and Relativity Media presentation, in association with Eden Rock Media, of a TIG production. Produced by Jim Wilson, Kevin Costner, Raynold Gideon. Executive producers, Sam Nazarian, Adam Rosenfelt, Marc Shaberg, Thomas Augsberger. Co-executive producer, Malcolm Petal. Directed by Bruce A. Evans. Screenplay, Evans, Raynold Gideon. Mr. Brooks - Kevin Costner Tracy Atwood - Demi Moore Mr. Smith - Dane Cook Marshall - William Hurt Emma Brooks - Marg Helgenberger Hawkins - Ruben Santiago-Hudson Jane Brooks - Danielle Panabaker In this ogre-ridden, ocean-going summer of sequels, "Mr. Brooks" reps a classic case of counter-programming. Original, adult and starring Kevin Costner as a serial killer, this suspense thriller with a smirk may not break any B.O. records, but it should provide discriminating audiences the antidote they seek to Clooneys-and-Caribbean fever, while giving Costner's career a considerable kick in the credibility department. Costner's mere presence in this noirish Bruce A. Evans-helmed psycho-drama -- which Costner also produced, with longtime partner Jim Wilson and co-writer Raynold Gideon -- is an attention grabber. Although one of the actor's best performances was as murderer Butch Haynes in Clint Eastwood's "A Perfect World," "Mr. Brooks" takes a tongue-in-cheek attitude toward murder and portrays its serial killer as an addicted personality, who tries 12-stepping his way to a less-murderous lifestyle. It would have been an entirely different movie with a more conventional star -- Anthony Hopkins springs to mind (as does "Silence of the Lambs''). But Costner delivers a complex cocktail of aloofness, insecurity and reluctant threat, which makes a novel script into something even more unusual. Add Demi Moore as the detective on the killer's trail -- another case of mid-career adjustment -- and "Mr. Brooks" becomes as much about perception as it is a peculiar take on reality. By all appearances, Earl Brooks is a pillar of his community. He even receives Man of the Year honors from an unnamed group in his unnamed city, as his wife, Emma (Marg Helgenberger) looks on adoringly. What none of the town folk--including Emma--know is that Earl has been murdering people for years -- expertly, strategically, cold-bloodedly. Although he's been keeping his homicidal demons at bay by attending AA meetings, his conscience -- which has a name, Marshall, and is played by William Hurt -- is prodding him to break his tenuous self-imposed sobriety and spill fresh blood. Enter the subplots: Tracy Atwood (Moore) is a predictably hard-as-nails detective who lost the so-called "Thumbprint Killer's" trail two years earlier and has other things on her mind -- for one, a gold digging, soon-to-be-ex-husband (Jason Lewis). Earl, too, has tangential concerns: A daughter (Danielle Panabaker), who may or may not have inherited his serial-killer gene (the science of "Mr. Brooks" may leave some viewers bewildered). And once he falls off the wagon, killing a pair of dancers in their uncurtained bedroom, Mr. Brooks acquires a kind of apprentice, Mr. Smith (Dane Cook), who saw what Earl did and wants to go along for the thrill ride. There are also a pair of crystal-meth freaks out to avenge themselves on Tracy, which provides the film its few shoot-'em-up moments and a car crash or two. But "Mr. Brooks" is most effective when it's dealing with Earl and his conscience. Hurt and Costner are terrific together as two sides of the same personality and, again, the casting is what it's all about. Marshall could have been portrayed as a grotesque monster, but instead, he's a very close complement to Earl -- similar in age, temperament and physique. John Lindley's subtle cinematography superbly delivers a morally dark film. Production values in general are topnotch.

Marvel Comics superhero the Silver Surfer, as featured in the forthcoming sequel "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer," found planets for his boss Galactus to consume until he turned to the good side. To promote the movie, 20th Century Fox got the Franklin Mint to "consume" 40,000 U.S. quarters and add a promotional image of the Surfer on the back. (If you found a quarter, you would be a trip to the world premiere of "Silver Surfer" in London). Cool? Debatable. Legal tender? Not so much. Actually, we were relieved that the U.S. Mint said Fox because it confirmed what we learned on our tour of the U.S. Mint. You can't take the tour in Washington D.C. like we did lo these many years ago (read: before 9/11), but the mints are open to visitors year-round. (If you're in D.C. already, you could see the , but they don't actually make the money there.) Maybe the execs at Fox, who claim they had no idea altering currency is something only the government can do, ought to treat themselves to a tour. & Login To Post A Comment Silver Surfer Angers U.S. Mint Not yet a member?

Jamison Stone, 11, claimed he shot and killed a massive wild pig that weighed more than 1,000 pounds earlier this month. He said the animal measured more than 9 feet from tail to snout. Jamison said he bagged the boar on a hunting preserve in eastern Alabama. However, the animal's size had some wondering if the whole thing was tall tale, despite pictures provided by his father. Now he has the swine's skull and some backup from a taxidermist. "Jerry (Cunningham), the taxidermist, brought me this bleached skull of my hog and this is a 1,051-pound hog skull and that's a ... 250-pound hog skull," the boy said, pointing to the skull of a smaller animal, placed next to his monster's hog for comparison. Cunningham agreed with Jamison on the size of the boar. "I actually skinned this pig out," Cunningham said. "And I know it was a 1,000-pound hog. It was that big. No doubt."

Maroon 5 debuts at No. 1 on album chart LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Are the movies running out of heroes and is this why lovable Kevin Costner, the perfect guy to play a washed-up baseball player, is now playing a sympathetic serial killer? Costner in an interview emphatically denies that is the reason he took the role of businessman Earl Brooks, the hero or villain depending on your point of view of "Mr Brooks," a reworking of both the Hannibal Lecter and Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde sagas which opens on Friday. Prissy Mr. Brooks is such a nice guy in his day job that he is named Portland, Oregon's "Man of the Year." And he is so personally embarrassed by his penchant for killing others that he goes to 12-step meetings and keeps imploring the higher power to make him a good person. "Hi," he says, "I am an addict." But he doesn't say what he is addicted to. The executive producer Sam Nazarian of the film released by MGM film is so impressed with Costner's performance that he asked recently, "How many actors can give you a serial killer you can root for?" And for some people that is the trouble with the film -- should you root for a serial killer or not? There are also some critics who say Costner grabbed the role of "Mr Brooks" as a change of pace, that he was tired of playing "Mr. Nice Guys," a notion he dismisses after a long and distinguished career that includes the controversial film "JFK." He also played a washed-up baseball player in 1998's "Bull Durham." "I've played killers before," he told Reuters in an interview in which he stressed that as nice as Mr Brooks might seem to be on the surface, he really isn't nice at all. "He is evil. There is no doubt about that," said Costner, who won Oscars for producing and directing 1990's "Dancing with Wolves." &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni Would you believe Costner as killer? LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Are the movies running out of heroes and is this why lovable Kevin Costner, the perfect guy to play a washed-up baseball player, is now playing a sympathetic serial killer? Costner in an interview emphatically denies that is the reason he took the role of businessman Earl Brooks, the hero or villain depending on your point of view of "Mr Brooks," a reworking of both the Hannibal Lecter and Dr. Jekyll and Mr Hyde sagas which opens on Friday. Prissy Mr. Brooks is such a nice guy in his day job that he is named Portland, Oregon's "Man of the Year." And he is so personally embarrassed by his penchant for killing others that he goes to 12-step meetings and keeps imploring the higher power to make him a good person.

The executive producer Sam Nazarian of the film released by MGM film is so impressed with Costner's performance that he asked recently, "How many actors can give you a serial killer you can root for?" And for some people that is the trouble with the film -- should you root for a serial killer or not? There are also some critics who say Costner grabbed the role of "Mr Brooks" as a change of pace, that he was tired of playing "Mr. Nice Guys," a notion he dismisses after a long and distinguished career that includes the controversial film "JFK." He also played a washed-up baseball player in 1998's "Bull Durham." "I've played killers before," he told Reuters in an interview in which he stressed that as nice as Mr Brooks might seem to be on the surface, he really isn't nice at all. "He is evil. There is no doubt about that," said Costner, who won Oscars for producing and directing 1990's "Dancing with Wolves." But he added, "I think the film breaks new ground. This is a genre that is not comfortable with a lot of humanity or a real sense of humour. I think the film has a chance to become a classic." He also expects the modestly budgeted film to build an audience by word of mouth rather than hit instant success. The film has a first-class cast with William Hurt as the demon egging Mr Brooks to keep on killing and Demi Moore as the police woman who is in pursuit of him. Bruce A. Evans, who directed and co-wrote the film, said he sees it as almost a Shakespearean tragedy. "This is about a very good man who has a disease .... The audience is asked to understand him." "We wanted to do the total opposite of Hannibal Lecter. We wanted the neighbours to say Mr Brooks was a wonderful man." The studios told Evans he got the idea of serial killers wrong, that they are loners and sociopaths and don't fit into society. "We took the opposite point of view .... If we make money on this film, we will do a sequel," Evans said. The reviews have been mixed with New York Magazine calling it a "holy mess" and Victoria Alexander of FilmsInReview.com saying it was "Costner's best performance ever! An intelligent, terrific thriller with twists and kinky characters." (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Chairman and controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone lauded his management team's track record to-date and the 29% stock increase it has overseen in less than a year. The stock went as high as $44.59 before closing up 1.5% at $44.53. The stock's previous year-high stood at $44.16. Shareholders at the meeting defeated a proposal by three investors that Viacom sell the Paramount studio, with the plan only attracting 0.4% approval. The event started just after Viacom announced an agreement to sell Famous Music -- for an estimated and better-than-expected $370 million -- to Sony/ATV, which is co-owned by Sony and trusts formed by singer Michael Jackson. Top Viacom brass had a strong presence at the meeting, with Dauman welcoming Paramount Motion Picture Group chairman and CEO Brad Grey, MTV Networks chairman and CEO Judy McGrath, BET Networks chairman and CEO Debra Lee and Tom Dooley, Viacom's senior executive vp and CFO. Dauman lauded these executives' combined Viacom experience of nearly a century, earning laughs when starting to add: "And if you throw in Sumner ... ." Redstone on Wednesday lauded Dauman and his team for their strategic vision, financial discipline and creative excellence, saying it was "one of the wisest decisions I've ever made" to make Dauman CEO. Overall, the chairman said he is "really confident" about the company's long-term outlook. More specifically, Redstone added that the firm is "truly hitting its stride in the digital world." Viacom's continued push into the digital space indeed was one key theme of the investor gathering. Asked by a young shareholder about possible original content creations in the digital world, CEO Dauman reiterated that Viacom is planning to roll out some new virtual worlds that are music related and not based on existing Viacom brands. As far as Paramount goes, Dauman lauded its "tremendous progress," adding: "we are enthusiastic about its short-term and long-term (outlook)." The shareholders proposing the Paramount sale had argued past weakness at the studio had held back Viacom's stock and also criticized its films' depiction of smokers. Dauman, however, touted his firm's upcoming films, including "Transformers," "Stardust" and "Beowulf," adding that the 2008 slate is "shaping up quite nicely" as well. The Viacom CEO also said there is a good opportunity in a direct-to-DVD business for Paramount and in creating more film labels based on Viacom cable networks, with BET Pictures launching this year. Dauman did not comment on one shareholder's proposal that Viacom launch a Paramount Movie Channel based on the example of the Fox Movie Channel. Officials weren't available to comment on whether such a channel has been considered. Ahead of Dauman and Redstone's bullish comments Wednesday, Miller Tabak + Co. analyst David Joyce also lauded the recent stock price appreciation at Viacom, raising his price target on the shares by $6 to $51 "to reflect a mix of cable network and studio entertainment businesses that are demonstrating the turnaround investors have started hoping for, reflected in the stock's price improvement, over the past six-plus months." The Famous Music deal, meanwhile, comes after a sales process started a few months ago. "The Famous Music catalog is a world-class asset filled with evergreen songs that people know and love," said Martin Bandier, who recently left his post as head of music publishing at EMI Group Plc. to become chairman and CEO of Sony/ATV. "The addition of the Famous catalog and its songwriters to Sony/ATV is another step in our long-range growth plans." Together with last month's acquisition of the Leiber Stoller music catalog, which includes hits like "Love Potion #9," the Famous deal "further enhances Sony/ATV's position in the global music publishing industry," added Sony Corporation of America CFO Rob Wiesenthal. Jackson, who owns 50% of Sony/ATV Music Publishing, called the transaction "a milestone event," saying "the diverse collection of songs in this (Famous) catalog range from timeless classics to contemporary hits." Founded in 1928, the Famous Music catalog includes 125,000 songs and sound cues, including such classics as "Footloose" and "Moon River," as well as popular themes from such films as "The Godfather," "Forrest Gump," "Mission: Impossible" and "Braveheart," as well as the "Axel F" theme from "Beverly Hills Cop." In addition, the catalog includes such contemporary hits as "Bad Day" by Daniel Powter, Shakira's "Hips Don't Lie" Eminem's "The Real Slim Shady." As for the stock-buyback program, Viacom said it has used up about $2.7 billion of an existing $3 billion repurchase plan, which will be completed. After that, it will buy back up to $4 billion of Viacom Class A and Class B common stock. "We view this as a modest positive for Viacom as we believe that share repurchase is the best capital allocation strategy for Viacom currently," Bear Stearns analyst Spencer Wang said. Also at the shareholder meeting, investors raised concerns about Redstone's high salary, which he defended as "probably too low," and derogative rap lyrics, with Viacom executives saying BET is committed to not allowing offensive lyrics on its air. Rap lyric protesters were joined outside the midtown Manhattan meeting by WGA representatives, who passed out leaflets as part of the guild's current campaign to organize six major shows on Comedy Central, including "Mind of Mencia," "The Sarah Silverman Program," "Reno 911!" and "The Showbiz Show With David Spade."

The dress went under the hammer at a sale of film and entertainment memorabilia at Christie's in New York. The auction house said it had expected the dress to fetch $30,000 (£15,192). In December, a black Givenchy dress created for Hepburn as Holly Golightly in the 1961 film caused an auction frenzy, selling for £467,200. The pink cocktail dress is believed to have been a late addition to the film and was used in the scene where Golightly learns of her brother's death and smashes crockery in a fit of grief. Hepburn was nominated for a best actress Oscar for the role, but lost out to Sophia Loren in Two Women (La Ciociara). Also in the auction was a programme from John F Kennedy's Birthday Celebration in Madison Square Garden, New York, on May 19, 1962 - famous for Marilyn Monroe's birthday serenade - which sold for $66,000 (£33,420). Items from the estate of comedian Stan Laurel made over $100,000 (£50,600). These included his trademark bowler hats, a set of bow ties and a folder with joke ideas: "Rather be pregnant than have tooth pulled? Make up your mind lady, so I'll know which way to tilt the chair," he wrote.

Medical Examiner Testimony Aids In Phil Spector Murder Trial This post was written by Laura Smith on 31 May, 2007 (06:07) | On a night in February 2003, 67-year-old music producer Phil Spector was accompanied by 40-year-old B-movie actress Lana Clarkson back to his home in Alhambra, California. She had been working as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. That night, she was killed by a bullet wound to the mouth. Spector is now on trial for her murder, but he claims that she committed suicide. Medical examiner Dr. Louis Pena recently testified that he believes that Clarkson was murdered that night and has evidence to prove it. He believes the barrel of the gun that was shot into the actressâs mouth was forced into her as indicated by bruising on her tongue and on Clarksonâs hands as well, indicating that blunt force trauma was present. When the trigger was pulled, she was killed instantly as the bullet blew out her top front teeth and severed her spine. The victimâs family was not present in the room when these graphic images were shown to the jury, and at least one jury member looked away. This medical testimony helps aid in some evidence that was unexplainable in the suicide argument that the defense has maintained throughout the trial. Along with this evidence, there are some details about the gruesome scene that donât match up with a suicide execution. For one, Clarkson was found dead in the foyer of Spectorâs mansion with a purse around her shoulder as if she were about to leave. She was said to have no signs of depression as stated by her personal writings. She had not put any of her affairs in order prior to her death to show that any suicide attempt was planned. Clarkson had been taking two drugs that are said to be given to sufferers of depression, but her neurologist has stated that he prescribed them to her for her complaints of chronic headaches. Things are not looking good for Spector at this point. He is credited for developing the âWall of Soundâ recording technique used when mixing pop music in the 1960âs. Several women who have been in relationships with Spector say he had a tendency to be violent, and he sometimes threatened them with a gun. Perhaps Clarkson, whose most famous role was in the 1985 film âBarbarian Queen,â angered Spector enough that night to make his threats a reality.

Steve Tilley looks at Gadgets. Check out his last Gadgets column here. Thu, May 31, 2007 Rogen on a high Canadian causing quite a buzz LOS ANGELES -- The most unlikely leading man of the summer is a deep-voiced young Canadian, somewhat less bulky than Shrek, and possessed of a fine, curly head of hair (a "Jewfro" as he calls it). And his take on his first on-screen love scene -- with the lovely Katherine Heigl -- is not exactly what you'd hear from Brad Pitt. "It's really kind of nerve-racking," Seth Rogen says of his onscreen lovemaking in the hilarious Knocked Up. "If I was 18-years-old, that would literally be as far as I ever went with a girl. "You're essentially dry-humping a girl -- I don't know if I can say that or not, but I'm going to say it -- who you don't know very well. And I was just afraid I was going to sweat on her, a great gob of sweat on to her forehead." There, in that amiably provocative, utterly honest statement, is the essence of Rogen's character, both onscreen and off. It's how he came off in his scene-stealing role as the pot-smoking, porn-fan buddy in The 40 Year Old Virgin (directed by his best friend and mentor, Judd Apatow, who convinced him to move from Vancouver at age 16 to join the cast of his TV series, Freaks And Geeks). And it's Rogen in spades in Knocked Up, which he co-wrote with Apatow, a comedy about a beautiful, ambitious TV entertainment reporter (Heigl) who becomes pregnant from a drunken one-night-stand with a pot-smoking slacker and tries to salvage the situation and give the guy a chance. In a summer of overblown sequels, it's being tagged as another sleeper hit a la The 40 Year Old Virgin. In Knocked Up, Rogen even plays a Jewish twentysomething from Vancouver named Seth. "Having no real skills, I always try to play characters close to myself," Rogen says, "(as for being cast as Canadian), I still say 'sorry' instead of 'saw-ry' and Judd is just tired of editing around it." The slacker part, however, is just acting. In fact, the preternaturally-talented Rogen began performing standup in Vancouver at 13, and with a friend at 14 began writing Superbad, the comedy about his high school that's finally being released in August. (In a classy touch of verisimilitude, he's had many of his old schoolmates at Vancouver's Point Grey Secondary sign releases so he could use their actual names in the film). "Someone gave me a tape of actors reading generic scenes for Freaks And Geeks, and Seth was really funny and seemed real," Apatow said. "You could just see the light was on him. He'd think things only a great comic would think of, even at 16-years-old. It was like he was born a fully-formed comedic personality. So when that got cancelled we did (the short-lived series) Undeclared, and I made him a writer." More importantly, Rogen joined the gang of Apatow-related actors and writers known as the Frat Pack (whose ranks include Will Ferrell, Jack Black, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell, etc. and Freaks And Geeks veterans like James Franco). "Looking back, it was just a great show and we all got along really well," Rogen says. "I think that's why we all want to keep working together." (Other F And G alumnus in Knocked Up include Jason Segel and Martin Starr, real-life best friends playing Seth's best friends). "I just finished a movie with James Franco (The Pineapple Express, which Rogen wrote and in which he co-stars), and we just kept looking at each other and said, 'If you told us eight years ago they'd allow us to be in a movie that we're the stars of, I'd never have believed it."

Lindsay Lohan's latest round of trouble has reportedly ended with her checking into rehab again. "Lindsay admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility on Memorial Day," a representative for the singer/actress said in a statement published on TMZ.com Tuesday afternoon (May 29). "Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation and respect the privacy of Lindsay as well as the other patients receiving treatment at the facility." Various reports put Lohan &#8212; who made a seemingly failed attempt to get sober during a stint in rehab earlier this year &#8212; packing off to Malibu, California's Promises facility, the same place where Britney Spears completed a program several months ago (see "Britney Back In Rehab Yet Again" ). Lohan's publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnick, did not return several calls and e-mails to MTV News seeking confirmation on Lohan's whereabouts. Early Saturday morning, Lohan was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence after smashing her car into a tree and a curb while speeding down Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles (see "Lindsay Lohan Arrested On Suspicion Of Driving Under Influence" Then on Tuesday, prior to TMZ.com posting the statement from Lohan's representative, New York's ran photos of the star seemingly passed out Monday in a friends' car after another night of partying. The photos depict Lohan &#8212; who reportedly spent Sunday night barhopping with friends &#8212; alternately with her eyes closed, mouth hanging open and slumped in the front seat of a car wearing a hooded sweatshirt. In one she is seen kneeling on the pavement outside the car. Also on Tuesday, Beverly Hills Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Mitch McCann told MTV News that the toxicology tests on Lohan could take four to eight weeks to complete, but that in addition to the misdemeanor driving under the influence charge, possible felony charges could be added if it is determined that the substance believed to be cocaine found in the smashed vehicle belonged to Lohan. Additionally, because Lohan is still a month away from her 21st birthday, if it is determined that she was intoxicated while driving, she could also face charges for underage drinking, McCann said. Police believe Lohan was driving at a "high rate of speed" when the accident occurred, but McCann said a reconstruction of the scene has not yet definitely determined how fast she was traveling.

See a photo you want? Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Thursday, May 31, 2007 Posted on Wed, May. 30, 2007 reprint or license this Young lady, go to your room So I wasn&#0039;t going to go there, but there she was again, Lindsay Lohan, the human SUV-wreck, crashing her way literally through the holiday weekend, honoring our brave soldiers in her inimitable fashion. Lohan is now more famous for her appearances in the tabloids than for those on screen. When a celebrity becomes identified for consistently bad behavior rather than good acting, the work dries up at precisely the time the paparazzi leap into overdrive. Lohan turns out to take a tremendous tab photo in all hair colors, though the weekend snaps (blond) aren&#0039;t headed for any keepsake album. Lohan was cited for a DUI - the tart&#0039;s diploma of choice - after crashing her Mercedes in Beverly Hills on Saturday. Traces of cocaine were found in the car though not, as yet, in her. Not providing the tabloids quite enough fodder for a traditionally slow news cycle, Lohan gave a command performance Memorial Day, falling outside a club before passing out in her SUV while forgoing a seat belt, clearly the preferred form of safety negligence for the famous. In a sad, ironic twist, three medallions claiming 30-days sobriety swung from the vehicle&#0039;s rear-view mirror. Lohan reportedly checked into rehab Tuesday. Promises - sounds like a feminine-hygiene spray - is dubbed "the Ritz of Rehab." It promotes "healing and luxury," ideal in a spa but counterproductive for detox. This marks five months since Lohan&#0039;s last rehab tour and four months after pal Britney Spears spent time at the $48,000-a-month Malibu facility. LiLo turns 21 on July 2. Understandably, Svedka Vodka pulled out as a sponsor of a planned two-day party extravaganza in Las Vegas celebrating her legal right to drink, an achievement for which Lohan appears to have been studying as assiduously as her peers might prep for the LSAT. Meanwhile, Paris Hilton, the third "Bimbo of the Apocalpyse," as the New York Post dubs them ("No clues, no cares, no underwear"), is scheduled to check into the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood Tuesday for 23 days, after violating terms of her DUI probation. The correctional institution promises neither healing nor luxury. Hilton is scheduled for release in time to f&#0234;te Lohan - that is, if they&#0039;re friends at that moment. OK, so they&#0039;re wrecks and gossip fodder, but the problem is they seem to be aspirational models for young women who would be better off without them. Over the holiday weekend, it was possible to see an endless parade of teenagers and tweeners aping the Bimbos of the Apocalypse slatternly attire at the shore. Bimb-Apo style favors low baby-doll tops, obvious strappage, tight shorts, occasional thong eruptions and those egregious, oversized bug sunglasses, usually white or metallic, which I thought experienced their sad moment in the sun two years ago, although clearly I was wrong. The glasses have the misguided effect of making the head, and its contents, appear very, very small while the vanity of the affectation seems too grand and important for the wearer. Only Jacqueline Onassis and Audrey Hepburn could get away with such an emphatic sartorial gesture. Meanwhile, I am sorry to report, that cryptic messages posted on posteriors have not gone away. I don&#0039;t know why people want strangers reading their chests, let alone "Princess" on their rears. Four summers ago, when "your ad here" shorts first appeared, I thought it would amount to but a blip in bad taste. Here, I am sorry to report, I was wrong, too. Bad taste is like a cockroach. You can&#0039;t kill it, and it will just multiply. It&#0039;s unclear to me why lovely girls want to mimic vapid strumpets whose greatest talents are for trashy behavior, tabloid portraiture, rehab and perp walks. I thought Paris would go away. And she will, but only for 23 days. I thought Lindsay would go away, and she will, too, but only promises to go to Promises and then she&#0039;ll be back. I was smart enough to know that Britney is never, ever, ever going away. I miss the plucky redhead Lindsay of before she found a misguided calling of creating 48-hour news cycles of continued crack-ups.

"I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on `American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. Paula Abdul poses for photographers before the Thrive Fall 2007 fashion show during the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week at Smashbox Studios in Culver City, Calif., in a Thursday, March 22, 2007 photo.

Save & Share Article Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of `American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul _ who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s _ says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of `American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer."

News - Spector Trial: Coroner Reasserts Homicide Ruling Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Spector Trial: Coroner Reasserts Homicide Ruling Wed, 30 May 2007 09:13:55 PM PDT It was another busy day for Phil Spector&#39;s defense team as it tried to take the prosecution&#39;s latest witness down a notch. The Los Angeles doctor who performed Lana Clarkson&#39;s autopsy wasn&#39;t biting, however. In his second day on the stand, deputy county coroner Louis Pena, who testified yesterday that Clarkson&#39;s death was a homicide, said under cross-examination that gunshot residue found on the alleged victim&#39;s hands does not necessarily indicate that she shot herself. Spector&#39;s camp is maintaining that the gunshot wound to the mouth that killed the actress was self-inflicted. Clarkson died in the hallway of Spector&#39;s Alhambra mansion in the early morning of Feb. 3, 2003. "It implies the person could have been holding the weapon or been in the vicinity when the weapon was discharged," Pena said, demonstrating how this is possible by placing his hands around his face and chest to show how gunshot residue could land on a person even if someone else pulled the trigger. Additionally, when defense attorney Christopher Plourd asked Pena if, in his experience, one could always find gunshot residue on the hands of a person who has just fired a gun, the coroner answered, "Not always." Pena testified Tuesday that a combination of physical and circumstantial evidence led to his ruling the death a homicide, including his impression that Clarkson was a "hopeful" person who did not seem as if she were considering suicide. One of the circumstances that contributed to his decision, he said, was that the right-handed Clarkson&#39;s body was found with her leopard-skin handbag draped over her right shoulder. "It bothered me a lot that she had her purse on her right shoulder," Pena said yesterday. "It&#39;s difficult for someone to take a weapon and shoot herself with the purse staying on her shoulder. It should be off." "She could have had a self-inflicted wound and the purse could have stayed on her shoulder, is that true?" Plourd asked Wednesday. "Yes, that&#39;s possible," Pena replied, but again said that the "totality of the circumstances" pointed toward her death being a homicide. "The only time you talked on the record about the purse being significant was yesterday, is that correct?" Plourd pressed. "Yes," Pena said, adding that, although it wasn&#39;t included in his notes or official reports, he had also brought it up briefly at a meeting once. Plourd then questioned the coroner about any mistakes his office may have made during the investigation. Pena said that one dental investigator did, indeed, drop a vial containing one of Clarkson&#39;s teeth, breaking the vial and losing the tooth in the process. The vial was taped up and returned to Pena, but the investigator didn&#39;t tell him about the incident until several months later. Tackling Pena&#39;s statements about the bruising found on Clarkson&#39;s arm, her hand and on the side of her tongue, indicating that the gun had been forced into her mouth, Plourd asked whether the bruise in her mouth could have been caused by a bullet. The doctor said that such an occurrence was "not normally seen." Pena did admit, however, that there was no real way to tell how fresh the bruises on Clarkson&#39;s arms, hands and legs were, especially considering the pain medications she had been taking at the time could cause a person to bruise easily. Prosecutors also showed the jury a photograph of Clarkson&#39;s bloodstained right hand, which showed that part of her acrylic thumbnail was missing. The Los Angeles District Attorney&#39;s Office has alleged that defense expert Henry Lee found a piece of nail&mdash;which could mean that a struggle took place&mdash;at the scene of the alleged crime and that the defense never shared the evidence with the prosecution. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler ruled last week that Lee did withhold something from prosecutors, although he couldn&#39;t say for sure if it was a fingernail or not. After the jury was excused today, Fidler rejected the defense&#39;s motion to limit testimony about this allegedly lost piece of fingernail. Plourd&#39;s cross-examination lasted all morning and is scheduled to resume tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. He also asked Pena a lot of questions about his seemingly high regard for defense experts Vincent DiMaio and Werner Spitz, the latter of whom authored a textbook that Pena had consulted during his investigation. Meanwhile, the usual horde of reporters covering the trial thinned out today, perhaps taking a breather while the two sides rehash the forensic minutiae of the case.

(AP Photo/Katsumi Kasahara) By DAVID GERMAIN AP Movie Writer LOS ANGELES May 28, 2007 (AP) "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" hauled in $142.1 million to commandeer the record for best Memorial Day weekend debut, capping a huge month that puts Hollywood on track for record summer business. Disney's third "Pirates" adventure fell far short of breaking the best three-day opening ever, the $151.1 million haul for Sony's "Spider-Man 3" three weeks earlier, according to studio estimates Monday. Movie Buff? Talk To Joel Siegel Yet "At World's End" cruised past last year's record for best four-day Memorial Day opening, $122.9 million for "X-Men: The Last Stand." Compared to its predecessor in the "Pirates of the Caribbean" movies, the $115.1 million that "At World's End" drew from Friday to Sunday was well behind the $135.6 million premiere last summer of "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," the second-biggest debut ever. Chuck Viane, Disney's head of distribution, said "At World's End" had been a longshot to break top box-office records. The movie runs two hours, 47 minutes, about 15 minutes longer than "Dead Man's Chest" and almost half an hour longer than "Spider-Man 3." That limited the number of screenings theaters could fit in. "Dead Man's Chest" and "Spider-Man 3" also opened amid lighter competition, while "At World's End" was up against "Spider-Man 3" and DreamWorks Animation's "Shrek the Third." "This is probably the most competitive Memorial weekend ever if not one of the most competitive weekends all time. It speaks volumes for how well we did," Viane said. "Obviously, we fell short of the three-day record of 'Spidey.' Everything's really obvious and really good." Adding in $14 million from Thursday night previews before its official Friday release, "At World's End" had taken in $156.1 million domestically. The movie also grossed $245 million internationally since Wednesday, putting its worldwide total at $401 million in a matter of days. The movie picks up where "Dead Man's Chest" left off, with Johnny Depp's wily pirate Jack Sparrow consigned to Davy Jones' locker and his old associates embarking on a rescue mission. `Pirates' Breaks Memorial Day Record Comment on This Story WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

"I couldn't stop smiling - I had such a ball being up there. "There were a few that were really devastated, which was a bit heartbreaking to see, but you just had to remind them that life's huge and this is just one little thing in their lives." The small-town girl from Queensland said she was shocked by the competitive nature of the South Americans and the round-the-clock, heavily made-up glamour of many of the contestants. "There was a lot of make-up, and the thing that amazed me is the fact that the girls can put up with the pain of wearing high heels all the time," Busteed said. "I couldn't wait to wear flats." Speaking before boarding a plane in Los Angeles for Australia, Busteed fobbed off criticism of her lifesaver-themed national costume.

Morning Mix: Woman Offers to Serve Time for Paris Queen? Bah. The Dutchess Visits Virginia Morning Mix: Lohan Checks Into Rehab Go Away, Lindsay Lohan chat each Thursday at 2 p.m. ET. Listen to Liz live Mon., Wed. and Fri. at 8:20 a.m. on Post Radio, 107.7 FM/1500 AM ( Have a tip or suggestion? Add This Blog To: Go Away, Lindsay Lohan Lindsay Lohan, she's got the whole world in her hands. (Reuters) The story of the day may well become the story of the year. Lindsay Lohan has acquired the dubious distinction of being the latest in a string of celebutantes to Paris Hilton was recently sentenced to an incredible-shrinking-jail-term for violating her DUI probation and Nicole Richie's fate will be decided in court on June 8 after her own for driving under the influence of alcohol, Vicodin and pot. Lohan's moment came in the wee hours of Saturday morning when the 20-year-old reportedly crashed her convertible Mercedes SL-65 into a curb around 5:30 a.m. Lohan was spirited away from the scene by friends. Cops later located the starlet at L.A.'s Century City Hospital and charged her with suspicion of DUI. They haven't yet decided who will face charges for the cocaine found in the vehicle. And, rather than keep a low profile in the wake of what is an undeniably sticky mess, a seemingly intoxicated (think buffalo tranquilizer) Lohan was spending her Memorial Day alternately incoherent and retching. Maybe it was Lohan's way of going out with a bang? If tabloid reports are to be believed, she may check herself in to Malibu's Promises rehab center by day's end (lately vacated by erstwhile sloppy drunk Britney Spears). Despite the tornadic vortex that is Lohan's nonstop party, she remains a working actress. A few weeks ago she walked the red carpet with Jane Fonda to promote their new movie "Georgia Rule." In late July, the actress stretches way out to play a stripper in the thriller "I Know Who Killed Me." Last week, Lohan said she'll spend the summer working on a new "urban pop" album and she's already lined up her next acting gig -- she'll continue with her serious actress/chick flick trajectory by co-starring with Olympia Dukakis and Shirley MacLaine in the dramedy " Is it naive that I'm mystified by Lohan's virus-like ability to attach herself to projects? Sure, perennial addict Robert Downey Jr. (now clean, by the way) got chance after chance after chance, but he was and is an incredible actor. And, in the age of celeb-reality, even some of Hollywood's biggest trainwrecks continue to pull a paycheck and our attention. Both Danny Bonaduce and Tom Sizemore scored reality shows based on their rapidly imploding lives. Maybe this "12,000 strikes and you're never out" policy sends the wrong message to young stars and those who emulate them. Maybe -- just maybe -- what Lohan needs is a cold shoulder, a little tough love that she's not likely to get from mom Dina (who "This [premieres and parties] is the fun part of the business. She'll be 21 in a few months. Regardless, of course, as a parents, you set boundaries and scold them. But there are these dark stories -- she is so misunderstood. All she wants to do is act and have a somewhat normal life. When you're 20, it's normal to want to go to The Ivy, to go to the hot stores. She can't live in a bubble.") or creepy dad Michael, who calls in his fatherly advice to the New York Daily News. Hollywood honchos -- who probably aren't reading this blog -- stop hiring this sick young woman. Not only will it give her an opportunity to heal herself and gain some much needed perspective, it will hammer home the lesson that if you behave like you, too, will share in his fate.

Posted by: methinks AM A few days in rehab is Hollywood's answer to anything. And we buy it. Posted by: A Few Days AM For the life of me I can't figure out why this girl is famous. She's an unremarkable actress, not spectacularly gorgeous, and can't sing that great. I guess she's pretty good at being a trainwreck. Posted by: boutros AM Lindsay needs to hang a picture of Anna Nicole Smith on her mirror so she can be constantly reminded what happened to that party girl. At the rate Lindsay is going she won't see 25, let alone 39. Since 12 steps seems a bit complicated for her, I got 3: 1. Get away from Mother -- NOW. 2. Stop going to clubs. Period. 3. Do not have an alcohol company sponsor your 21st Birthday Party. Posted by: ep AM I follow this trainwreck much too closely for my own good, but I'm always stumped on how these LA, NY, and Vegas "establishments" are not brought down for serving minors like Lohan...how is it we hear of her "partying late into the night" at X, yet she and some of her pals are under-age. Why is no one coming down on these bars and clubs? Posted by: Jay in DC AM I think we're all missing the real victim in this story: That car has been bent and dented. It will NEVER be the same. It will go through the rest of its life with an insurance claim on its record and anyone will be able to read about it on Carfax. Please, won't somebody think of the car? Posted by: byoolin AM boutros, my thoughts exactly. Posted by: st.louis AM she was in Mean Girls and then....? what has she done since then that was of any distinction? Herbie, Fully Loaded (should have been Lilo, Fully Loaded). I am baffled. Posted by: AM Maybe she can't live in a bubble, but she can call a cab or hire a driver when she's drunk. Her mother says she is "misunderstood". Maybe the right word is "exploited by parents." Posted by: POS AM "For the life of me I can't figure out why this girl is famous" She is famous because the Media made her famous. They follow her around all day long until she trips up then they got a story. She is what you call a cash-cow. If the media wasn't around the poor girl would probably straighten out her life. Posted by: Voted most famous AM I don't feel sorry for Lindsay. She is only going to rehab in hopes of getting probation for the DWI charge and possible felony cocaine charge. She and her enablers (aka Mom and Dad) do not take her drinking problem seriously. Posted by: Lisa1 AM LL, like her famous cohorts, are symbols of our declining popular culture. Young people admire and emulate this behavior. Its poisonous. Yet they avoid the natural consequences that others would expect. The behavior is tolerated in Hollywood, just as the negative behavior of professional athletes is tolerated by our society. Posted by: Renee AM I always find photos like those so disturbing... she's totally out of it and it is gross. I'm so sick and tired of all those stupid little rich girls who are famous because the media thinks they deserve to be. Oh poor them... rich and nothing to do with their time or money but get drunk and crash cars. Thank goodness I had actual real women to look up to while I was growing up and hope to steer my daughter in that direction as well. Posted by: Mama AM Shame on these celebrity rehab places that stress the former and not the latter. I know people without a dime who desperately need rehab but can't get in because there aren't any beds available, yet these stars walk in and out as if these centers were a Starbucks. Sure, Lindsay is free to leave, but if these rehab places are serious, they should do everything in their power to convince her to stay. Lohan's dad is too easy to make fun of, but he's right in that she needs extensive help for her problem. That she is a celebrity makes it no less so. Posted by: JD AM It's also amazing how much her partying is ageing her. In recent photos I've seen of Lindsay, she looks to be in her thirties; people think she and her mother are near the same age because Lindsay looks older as opposed to Dina looking younger. Posted by: Caprice AM It's hard to feel much sympathy for LiLo. She's been a working actress for much of her life-- an environment that promotes self-destructive behavior-- but seems to have a family that *facilitates* craziness rather than reining it in. I also don't feel that she's such a talent that her "star power" will outshine the clear drawbacks of hiring her (i.e., negative publicity, questionable professional behavior, etc.). If her ability to pull in tween audiences starts to fall (and I think it will, soon), she won't find as many offers coming across her agent's desk. Her best bet is to clean up and get professional about her career, and fast. Posted by: DB AM - I too am baffled by her ability to get jobs. You would think that since she doesn't have a trust fund and has to work for a living (that can be debated) she wouldn't sully her reputation. - Someone in her crew thought to move the car while a camera crew filmed the whole thing. There is dumb and then there's LiLo and her friends. Orange jumpsuits for all of them. Posted by: petal AM DUI? How about leaving the scene of an accident? That is against the law here in MD. How about in CA? The "drugs in the car" can be beat by a public attorney with wet ink on his diploma: No concrete evidence trail. Add in the fact the paparrazi was on the scene and LL can (and probably would) testify drunk to beat that charge. Her mom sure likes riding the gravy trail her daughter is providing, doesn't she? LL is going the route of ANS and LL's mom will be the first to write a book after the funeral. Heck, she probably has everything but the ending already written. Posted by: SoMD AM The thing about Lilo - similar to what DB said - is that she is really suffering from the child star syndrome somewhat. Since those cute little twin lindseys in parent trap to train wreck. And the actors she works with Do say she has some tallent. Maybe one of these days she'll clean up her act and we can see that side of her again. Posted by: sjcpeach AM What're the odds on her surviving the next six months? Posted by: bouttime PM I think that if some of these girls actually stayed the course and went through rehab that they would come out on the other end in a much better position. Unfortunately none of them actually do! The party seems to continue whether they are in or out of rehab. Someday movie producers will wise up and not hire them, unfortunately its people like us who keep reading about them that make the whole situation possible. I must admit that I love to read about it, so I am as much a part of the problem I guess. Personally, I would like her to really get the help she needs. I wish all of them would. Posted by: In DC PM this whole drug infestation is getting, OLD. Cops need to take their show to Hollywood, the DEA needs to wreak havoc in hollywood...come on its getting to ridiculous, itz either this girl needs to sober up or die. Posted by: me PM People can say what they will. The bottom line is that I do not support the work of people who cannot live a life of principles and decency. Fun is one thing, endagering the lives of others is another. Next time you support LL, think about the thousands of lives cut short by intoxicated drivers just like her. Posted by: Decency PM What's really unfortunate is that she doesn't seem to have anyone who is legitimately in her corner. Self-interested father and oblivious mommy don't seem capable of helping her to recognize that she's in the process of killing herself and needs help, now. She's on her own, and unless she takes hold of this opportunity to start coming to grips with her addiction--who else but an addict gets a DUI on Saturday and falls out drunk on Monday?--she may not see her 22nd birthday. Posted by: JanetK PM Is Lindsey like Anna Nicole Smith or more like Drew Barrymore? Drew was a total trainwreck in her teen years too - with a mom she had to divorce to get away from and it took her a long time to clean herself up. But all along, she too was touted as having some talent and look at her career now. Have things really changed in Hollywood or are we engaging in selective memory? Posted by: anonymous PM Daddy Lohan didn't call in his advice. He gave it in a face-to-face interview. Posted by: erouen PM I guess she is about one year away from doing pr0nz on the interwebs. Posted by: Bubbie PM when i said i felt sorry for her, it was because i know how difficult it is to stay sober. heck, it's difficult to realize you need help. janetk is absolutely correct, there appears to be no one willing to stand up and help her out of love for her rather than some sort of self interest. liz's assertion, that the hollywood types need to stop hiring her, is a sound one. she needs time, and maybe a loss of income and prestige, to get to the point where she's willing to make a significant life change. the sad thing is, she's likely to get much worse before she gets better. and, optimist that i am, then it might be too late.

Posted by: txgrandma PM On a slightly different subject, I'd like to know why the writer of this article calls LL's father "creepy". His comments seemed perfectly reasonable to me. Is it because he mentioned God? Is that what "creepy" means to Washington Post writers? Posted by: Burt PM Back to your boring lives, TV America. You are why Lohan's famous. Posted by: PM I don't care what Linsey Lohan does. She played a cute high school kid in Mean Girl's. That's it. Now if she wants to wrap her head around a telephone pole, that's entirely up to her. Go for it Lohan. The press would love that one. Posted by: Woodie PM Lindsay Lohan. Sexy hell yeah i'd hit it. Posted by: kevin PM it is so depressing on so many levels -- the mother posing in the back of a stretch limo for harpers & talking about how she takes ll's old clothes, the dad (& yeah - in jail for assault is "creepy", never mind the God part), & the endless stories, pictures, etc. - but what's worse is that even if lindsey were to disappear tomorrow, there would be ten thousand girls who'd be happy to take her place...she isn't an actress. she's a creation, a product. when she stops selling, she'll be dropped. Posted by: abd PM ya know what i'd like to see is somthing real happen. no matter how much celeberty and money thease people have just one of them get some serious concequences as a result of getting busted. 45 days??? I'd got at least a year. what happend to mandatory minimums?I want to see Paris or Lindsy serve like at least a year and a severe probation. I'd probablly lose my job. would Lindsy?? NO she'd work because her employer can't afford to just hire a talented undiscovered talent that would work better. nope gotta have Lohan! drunk or sober. and I also gotta say she is a "butterface" she has (or had) a kick ass body.....but her face??? so whats so gr8?? Beautiful people everywhere...and were stuck with her??? Yep it's a beautiful world!!! the law is so blind and unbiased. Hollywood, please hire somone fresh and new! give someone deserving a chance! Posted by: we are all DEVO PM Wasn't her father in prison for a good amount of time? Wasn't it for drinking and driving? And he's a real winner in the personality department, from what I recall. And Burt, I don't think mentioning God would cause anyone to consider you "creepy", but that was a good try to pigeonhole the WP as "evil, leftist, and anti-religion". Bonus points to you for being creative. ; ) Posted by: Maritza PM 1. We admiited we were powerless over alcohol--that our lives had become unmanageable. There is a way...may you find it (before you die) Posted by: Steve F. PM I'm feeling cynical today, so I'm just going to say it: I believe our CULTURE, not just celebrities, is suffering badly from the "12,000 strikes and your never out" policy. There are a lot of people who are never held accountable ... from the White House to the average kid. Posted by: It's depressing, but ... PM Posted by: bobo PM This girl is great. Let her figure stuff out and please pass the popcorn Posted by: ACP PM "Maybe this "12,000 strikes and your [sic] never out" policy sends the wrong message to young stars and those who emulate them." I think it's not just that they're never out, it's that because of this kind of drama, they're topping the list of Maxim's hottest 100. They're being glorified and simultaneously condemned for it. Talk about mixed signals. I'm so over LL. Posted by: Jagshemash PM Lindsey, Paris, Rosie, etl....It must be a "slow" news summer. Celebrity antics are rampant along with celebrity squabbles...not to mention everyone and his brother giving their "expert" advice and/or giving their "opinion" as expert advice...everyone should "take a breath"...Law breakers are law breakers. Opinions are...well you know... It seems that "any publicity is good publicity" is the only concern nowadays.. Sad for us....Sadder for them.. Posted by: EnoughAllReady PM I agree that enough is enough with these vulgar girls. She's obviously extremely desperate for attention or she wouldn't live her entire life in front of the cameras. You can tell she loves it because she constantly poses. She needs to be ignored - only then will she get help. What I can't understand is why an underage minor has been drinking all around town, photographed in an out of clubs that minors aren't allowed in, yet the police and authorities in Los Angeles aren't cracking down.

Posted by: hj PM If Liz Kelly really wanted Lindsay Lohan to disappear, she would stop writing about her. Let's face it, the drug-addled antics of today's celebrities are what keeps her fed. When is the media going to take any responsibility for perpetuating the decline of public discourse in the US? The Post should fire Kelly and use the money to hire another beat reporter. Posted by: the rza PM Is this really worth our time??? While we have a military stretched to the breaking point and a declining health car system, educational system (nearly 50% high school drop out rate), social security system, medicare care system, transportation system, a polarized congress and an administration that prefers to violate our rights rather than protect them (just to name a few of our problems), we consider Lohan, Hilton, Trump, O'Donnell etc. to be "newsworthy". I wonder if a couple of thousand years ago some Romans were sitting around and saying "What the hell went wrong?" Posted by: B L PM Lindsey L. is an extreme example of a very common problem in AA. Drunk tries to get sober for the wrong reasons, never hits bottom, never really sees their own drinking problem, doesn't address underlying issues (usually extreme self-hatred and fear), drinks until life-changing event occurs. That usually results in long stays in jails or hospitals. If she doesn't stop drinking then the diagnosis is usually death, slow and painful. What few people realize about alcoholism is that the people who suffer from it die from loss of blood. They poison their intestinal systems and it causes them to bleed from the inside out. Throwing up blood is common and bleeding rectally is an end stage symptom that signals death if the person is still mentally all there, which they usually are not. The good news for her is that this could be the beginning of the end of her active drinking, but the bad news is that she is probably going to spend some time behind bars. Celebrity or not, she can take herself out, but a judge will not continue to let her pose a risk to innocent drivers in LA. Good luck, Lyndsey. I hope to see you in an AA meeting someday. It would be inspiring to hear that you read this or someone close to you read it to you. I speak from experience and have been sober for over 17 years. Posted by: AAKen PM "Actress Lindsay Lohan continued to party over the holiday weekend, despite being arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. On Sunday she attended a Memorial Day pool party for 944 magazine at Hollywood's Roosevelt Hotel. She was also pictured apparently asleep or passed out in the passenger seat of her DJ friend Samantha Ronson's car later that morning. Miss Lohan dropped her sunglasses and cigarettes on her way out of the hotel, then collapsed when she bent to pick them up and a bouncer lifted her into the car, the New York Post reported" You go girl! Booze, Cocaine, Cancer Sticks, and who knows what else will have her dead before she hits 25. Posted by: lindsay coke_ho PM The key to Lindsay is the same as the key to all of us: look to the values and confidence instilled by parents and home life. Dina is a train wreck end every time she opens her mouth, it's more and more obvious why she's got a daughter spinning out of control. And Dad is so pathetic he's comical. There's no big mystery here. Keep following the tabloids - Lindsay has a younger sister and brother to be exploited, too.

Posted by: messykat PM I don't want to hear Lindsay say she's being target by cops either, (i.e. Paris Hilton style) because if you or I did what either of those two have done, we'd still be sitting in jail two weeks later. Posted by: Sarah PM If you are not such a great actor that people will simply wait for and go see your next movie, you have to have a gig that will keep you in the public's short memory. Not everyone has the commitment necessary to fly around the world adopting children, or the money to start up schools in Africa, or the bad judgement to issue political statements. It is just easier to keep your picture in paper when you drink til you vomit, dance til you pass out, toss out your dignity and self-esteem with your panties, and go to rehab for forgiveness. Posted by: Paul Garneau PM I don't understand why she isn't just removed from the Hollywood limelight. Why wouldn't my 20-year-old daughter try to get away with drinking/driving/drug-taking if all of these celebrities get to walk away without any serious consequences. In a country of "equality" why do we allow these people to live by different standards? Instead we inherit a newly ruined former child-star who will distract us on from more important daily news stories. Thanks Disney! Posted by: JB PM I think Drew Barrymore should open a clinic and give advice to these former teen and child stars as to how she was able to get on with her life, away from addiction, and forge a very successful Hollywood career. Posted by: Jim PM Jim, if you only knew how many celebritiesmo as famous or more famous than Drew B. are "doing the work" as we say in AA, then you would know that these clinics are held about 2,200 times a week in Los Angeles county. They are called AA meetings and are free to attend for anyone who thinks they may have a drinking problem.

Paris Hilton, Britney Spears, Nicole Richie and Lohan serve as endless fodder for my schadenfreude-entertainment. They are pathetic and miserable and bearing their angst for all the world to see. I can't WAIT till Lohan is found dead of a coke overdose, I can only hope it's from falling out of a 20-story building. Posted by: Xrys PM For my life I cannot understand Dina Lohan. She has been quoted quite a bit lately saying this is normal behavior for a girl this age. How can ANYONE standby and watch their daughter go down in flames like this. Lindsay has a serious problem, MOST parents would get their child help, not defend them, or assign blame. Linday = WORSE PARENTS EVER Posted by: Cherie PM When are the txgrandmas going to learn how to use the interwebs? And apostrophes? Also, wasn't LL a passenger? Maybe I heard wrong. Posted by: snotty lady PM 1. AA is for people who want it, not for people who need it. 2. There was a joke in AA making the rounds in the late 90's. A Hollywood producer was talking to a friend when she said she was late for her AA meeting. Her friend said, "I didn't know you were an alcoholic!!" The producer said, "I'm not. AA Meetings are where all the deals get done these days." 3. The celebrities aren't the problem, if you don't read about certain celebrities in the tabloids they probably go to AA. 4. AA saved my life. It is a hip place to hang. Posted by: AAKen PM AAKen I'm glad it worked for you & as you said, it's for those that want it. You can't force someone into it. Paul Petersen, of the Donna Reed show fame (showing my age but I saw the reruns on Nick @ Nite ages ago not in it's original run), started a group for kids like LiLo & the numerous others that have been victims of their parents greed & the machine that is Hollywood. It's called A Minor Consideration & I think the Lohans could use some of their help & I'm surprised they haven't yet commented anywhere on this whole mess. If they have I've missed it. Posted by: Bored @ work PM Doesn't LL have a little sister? Is she hiding out with the other normal relatives or will we soon also be seeing her demise into addiction? Save little lohan! Posted by: sjcpeach PM Why are any of you wasting your time blogging about Lindsay!!!! Save that to mourn for the poor victim who will be killed as a result of her driving under the influence because that's exactly what's going to happen if the court system continues to tap her on the wrist and send her back out with a bottle in her hand to drive away! She is set and ready to take somebody's life as a result of vehicular homicide. The police department and the court system -- along with her parents -- will share the blame along with her. It's just a matter of time before Nicole, Paris, Brittney or Lindsay kills somebody as a result of their DUI. My beloved uncle was killed that way and it makes me so angry that they are letting these girls get away with it. Check out the smirks on their faces. They're laughing at the system. Posted by: luv2laff11 PM You say "wasting time blogging about Lindsay," we say, "a pleasant afternoon baiting trolls." Posted by: byoolin PM To quote President Ronald Reagan, "Too bad spanking is out of fashion." In Ms. Lohan's case, she needs more of a mental "spanking" than a physical one, though both would do her good. I lost a wife and daughter at a very young age because of a drunk driver and that is the really sad part about the case of Ms. Lohan. It's not so much how she is destroying herself, but she may harm some innocent folks along her path of destruction; similar to a tornado out of control. She really needs help and in my opinion she is crying out for that help, but no one is listening. Most people are concentrating too much on "punishing" her instead of giving her the help she needs. The media is not focusing on what is CAUSING this girl to go to wild parties and feel she needs to drink until she is drunk. I hope someone or some people close to her can get her the help she needs to straighten out her life. She needs to be separated from the people surrounding her right now. They are not helping her, but encouraging her bad behavior. There are many rich girls in the world who do not behave in her manner and are responsible, law-abiding citizens. I don't buy this nonsense about bored, spoiled rich girls who don't know what to do with their money and go through phases of wild parties. Some women like Ivanka Trump have all the money they need and know how to act responsibly. Apparently Ms. Lohan has never had that guidance. I sure wish I could give her that guidance. We should be trying to help this girl more than ridiculing her and the first step is to get her off the streets. No more partying and hanging around with the wrong crowd is the first step. It's not just for her own life, but for the people around her as well. Posted by: Luca Brasi PM enough is enough it is time for all of us as people of this great sociaty to stop standing by and letting all this coruption continue to take place. Not just from the drunken celebrities,but from all the crime in our sociaty. We really need to take a hard look at all these law makers we have put into power. What have they done for the people lately. All of them are in bed together,money talks to money Posted by: Reggie of DC PM bwaaaaaa-hahahaha byoolin!! *sigh* my hero. Posted by: methinks PM Maybe my first sentence didn't come across well. I wasn't criticizing us bloggers because I wouldn't know about the blogging if I wasn't here myself. In essence I was saying all of our efforts are wasted on talking about Lindsay -- even though she's the subject -- because she's going to do what she wants to do anyway. She is surrounded by enablers who are afraid to speak up. I pray we never have to mourn her death or anyone else's, but if she insist on doing what she knows is wrong, somebody is going to pay a horrible, horrible price for it -- and all the money in the world will not bring that person back. Posted by: luv2laff11 PM Leave her alone. We are just watching Nature's way of proving Darwin's theory. Soon she will be culled from the breeding program and we all will be better for it. Posted by: pc PM Am I the only person that thinks she a good actress? Some very respected actors obviously think she's good - Meryl Streep, Felicity Huffman, Jane Fonda, etc. Posted by: pwa PM "Is it naive that I'm mystified by Lohan's virus-like ability to attach herself to projects? Sure, perennial addict Robert Downey Jr. (now clean, by the way) got chance after chance after chance, but he was and is an incredible actor." Lohan is also considered a very good actor--don't kid yourself, beyond all the tacky antics is some genuine talent. ROBERT ALTMAN cast her, for God's sake. And Meryl Streep sang her praises as well. It's frustrating as heck watching her drink away her talent, and her parents (although I don't doubt they love her) have not done right by her. The poster above who compared her to Drew Barrymore is dead on--let's hope she has the same trajectory. Posted by: NYC PM Let's face it, Lohan and Paris are what we've made them. We've stood back and chortled at this misfortune all the while feeding into it. Have you ever heard of negative reinforcement? Meanwhile, how many people get the fact that these girls are paid to attend parties. That's right, although they'd like you to believe that Paris makes her money on the runway and Lohan at the box office, they're actually paid large sums to go to parties (and bring the press with them) so they know exactly what they're doing and someone somewhere is paying them to vomit - always the sign of a good party, right? To see my solution (think Celebrity Drunk Tank) - read my blog today at http://www.somelikeitscott.com/2007.05.01_arch.html#1180455540163 And visit my site for more Scott at http://www.somelikeitscott.com/ Posted by: somelikeitscott PM Go away and stay away ........Not a good actress........ Posted by: los angeles PM I am at a loss for understanding what all the hub bub is about. Posted by: beautiful11 PM I am at a loss for understanding what all the hub bub is about. Posted by: beautiful11 PM i have to say, thats its a good thing what Happen TO LL, i myself got a DUI @the age of 20, now 24, i look back & think how dumb i was, time passes, people move on its nice to slow down, cause in the end no one is thier but you!! Posted by: EDDIE PM Make examples of all of them. Why is it that Joe Shmoe is kept out of a club for being underage but "celebrities" get a wink and a nod? Paris was a regular at LA, NYC and Miami clubs well before she was of legal age. I hope Lindsey gets professional help cause it sure isn't coming from her "parents". Posted by: Swankymodes PM Ms. Lohan has some serious problems but she is actually a talented actress. If you look at her early Disney work like "The Parent Trap" she clearly possesses great ability. Unfortunately she may be more like Bobby Driscoll than Paris Hilton. Driscoll was one of Walt Disney's favorite child actors, the voice of Peter Pan and actor in "Song of the South," "Treasure Island" and "The Window." He died penniless from drug abuse. Posted by: LAX PM I think I spotted a 'type O', don't you think it should be "urban pot"???? What a mess to come home to......... "Lohan said she'll spend the summer working on a new "urban pop" album and she's already lined up" Posted by: Copywriter PM this is the worst newspaper ever. congratulations! Posted by: bill PM She's a media pin-cushion and it will never go away. I looked up "Hollywood" in the dictionary: (2) A place where people bounce back and forth from rehab She needs to go to church, get saved, get real (funny how nobody says that anymore). Posted by: Aaron PM To all those thinking that rehab would help if they finish; I had a dear friend that had gone to rehab 8 times before the age of 25. What she needed wasn't just rehab to clean her out but family to be strong enough to say no to her. She started craving the drugs again and mom told her to go with her cousin because it would be safe if she "did it in her home." Guess what, she overdosed. Tough love could save so many people with addiction but society tells moms and dads that they can be their childs friend. Hells no. Posted by: Silver Springer PM thats whats its about, parents teach morals. America is in bad shape because parents are not parenting, not teaching morals. Parents teach you kids respect, spare the rod spoil the child. Posted by: morals PM I saw the pics. Lohan is just tired. Very VERY tired. And myopic. I know I always walk on all fours to find my glasses. Posted by: PM You got it right! Salvation got me permanently sober. Posted by: luv2laff11 PM Well, the real moral of this story is that the rich and famous DO live by a different set of rules than we do, and there is a huge industry feeding off their misbehavior. As "Jay in DC" asked, why aren't the cops going after the businesses who are publicly serving alcohol to minors? It's all about the money machine. Don't forget, every one of you just took the time to read this article, and eyeballs = money... Posted by: Steve PM You are absolutely right. If we stop adding fuel, the fire has to go out. Posted by: luv2laff11 PM God, so sad. She's got her 30-day chip around her neck. So sad. To the people posting glib comments about what she should or should not do. Addiction is far, far tougher than any of you are. It'll kick your ass from here to Mars and back. You have no idea. Posting comments is easy. Earning a 30-day chip is hard. Ask someone who's ever been an addict, or lived with one. I hope this apparent relapse turns out to be a milestone for her on her struggle to permanent sobriety. Posted by: Mark PM I'm sorry, but when the media - who report on this crap 24/7 instead of real news - tells Lindsay Lohan to "go away" ... well, that's just funny. You're the only ones who are keeping her in the spotlight. Posted by: Ed PM Alcoholics need to be trainwrecks before they are willing to stop drinking. They must hit bottom. How far down they fall is their own choice once they have been introduced to AA. a lot of ingnorance still exists about alcoholism. Please read the following carefully if you want to be part of the solution. Loss of family, loss of job, loss of business, loss of all support (emotional, physical, financial), and yes, even killing innocent bystanders in a tragic car accident or worse. For example, pilots flying commercial aircraft drunk, bus drivers, train engineers, ship captains. The Exxon Valdez disaster in Prince William Sound (worst ecological disaster in US history) was caused by a drunken ship captain. These jobs should be forbidden to anyone without weekly sobriety tests whether they are drunks or not. It averts major disasters because you can be sure that airlines will never admit they let a drunk fly an aircraft that crashed and killed hundreds of people. Think financial liability. You might be surprised to learn that pilot error is airline code for drunk while flying. I have heard some harrowing stories in AA ranging from a guy that got released from prison after serving 20 years for a crime he didn't remember committing to a guy that wiped out an entire family of four in an accident in a blackout. He spent 25 years in prison. The sad truth is that many newcomers to AA tell themselves that it will never happen to them until it does. Drunks are very ingenious at hiding their misdeeds and lying to people who care about them. Family members who are enablers thrive on the control that a sick alcoholic relinquishes to them. The drunk willing gives up responsibility for their own lives and then blames others for their problems. It is a common problem and the family member is as sick as the alcoholic. That is why Alanon (the family members 12 step program) exists. Once an alcoholic manifests drunken behavior, the progression of the disease gets worse until the drinking phase ends. Court-ordered in many cases. True statistic, 85% of prison offenders have drugs or alcohol involved in their crime. AA is the easier softer way out of trouble because courts respect AA's track record of helping drunks get sober. Churches don't usually welcome alcoholics and the courts are not sentencing criminals to church for that reason. If a drunk lives the principles of AA, they find a Supreme Being of their own understanding that solves their problem. Step 2: Came to believe in a Power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity. Many drunks are unable to admit they are insane. A good look at their behavior while drinking is proof enough for alkies who want to honestly stop drinking. Drunks don't like to be told what to do, but if they will listen to an alcoholic who has stopped drinking. They respect that and can't understand how a real drunk can stop drinking for good. It is the their only hope for a normal life, if they want a normal life. Shaming a drunk is like pouring gasoline on an open flame. They hate themselves for what they view as a weakness. Shame is what they get everytime they drink and act out. They are used to it and the shame actually helps them cope with their feelings of guilt. That is part of the negative reinforcement by the sick Alanon of bad behavior. The Alanon wants to believe them and the drunk gets relief from the guilt of their alcoholic actions because the shame feels like responsibility to them. They try to convince themselves it will be different next time. The media is not helping in that regard. The less they write about a specific alcoholic and the more they educate the public about AA, the more of a public service they perform. I hope that the editor of the Washington Post or someone at the Post is reading this blog. It is a moral responsibility for a story about a debilitating disease such as alcoholism to include at least one line about the solution, in this case it is AA. You can be part of the solution, not the problem. It is your choice. Posted by: AAKen PM Not sure if there's an AA problem here and think that the dissertation by the AA guy is warranted in this case. So many are speculating on the real situation with L.L. and it's good to hear that she is seeking help, although it's too bad she can't get help from her immediate family. Posted by: Paul PM Re these comments by AAKen: "Alcoholics need to be trainwrecks before they are willing to stop drinking. They must hit bottom.

This is one of the common conceptions which AA teaches about alcoholics, but as AA's Big Book shows, it's not necessarily always so. Many of the stories in Part II are by people who specifically did not "hit bottom", but were able to stop. I'm just pointing this out in case there are readers who are alcoholics and are thinking of seeking help. It's never too soon! Posted by: Mark | May 30, 2007 01:24 AM Liz Kelly, who peddles celebrity news for lack of any journalistic integrity is telling a celeb whose antics keep her in a job to go away. This is the woman who has a "Stories by Category" section on celebs whose antics are reported minute by minute. Lindsay and her ilk needs to go away and Liz Kelly and her ilk need to go look at their journalism degrees and ask themselves the last news of note they reported! Posted by: Amy | May 30, 2007 05:03 AM Liz has an ilk? Posted by: byoolin | May 30, 2007 08:17 AM I'm amused by the naivete of the people who've posted things like "the media have made her famous." Somelikeitscott (great name!) had it right when he wrote, "Let's face it, Lohan and Paris are what we've made them." The 9 movies released to date in the US in which Lindsay has appeared have sold just under $420,000,000 worth of tickets. If the media were making her famous there wouldn't be enough reporters left outside the theatres to publish a PennySaver. Posted by: byoolin | May 30, 2007 09:07 AM Mark is right. Not every Alcoholic hits rock bottom, but they do hit their own personal bottom. I did srite, "How far down they fall is their own choice once they have been introduced to AA." So, while life-changing events that limit certain people from ever rejoining society do happen. Some bottoms are not as extreme as others. Judge for yourself what your real situation is and know that alcoholism is a progressive disease, unfortunately. It gets worse, never better. Which means that even after 17 years without a drink, I would not start where I left off when I stopped. My disease progessed all those 17 years and it would be as though I never stopped at all once I took that first drink. I am a real alcoholic. I can never safely drink again, living the AA recovery one day at a time. AA rocks!! Posted by: AAKen | May 30, 2007 01:30 PM I'm personally sick and tired of these girls. They have no concept of what life is all about and can't wait until their next drug or drink because they can't handle the fame. Boo-Hoo. Go out everyday and work, earn a living then you have the right to complain. They are given every advantage and don't have the sense god gave them. Who cares??

Posted by: patti Escabi | May 30, 2007 01:36 PM Why is it never mentioned that she is underage to drink. How does she get served at apparently every bar in Los Angeles. I know, I know, she is a celebrity. Do the police turn the other way when an underage celebrity is served in every bar in town. Shouldn't she lose her drivers license for like 10 years for a DUI when you are underage? How come this is never mentioned? Posted by: Jim72344 | May 30, 2007 01:57 PM Arrest the bartender who served her. Posted by: Jeremiah | May 30, 2007 02:14 PM I have the same question as Jim72344. Why aren't the establishments that are illegally serving her being called on it? I'm sure that's going to be one of her excuses. Her talent in Parent Trap has faded. The media has nothing to do w/her bank account, she doesn't get paid everytime her name appears in print. The only way to get rid of her is not go see her movies or buy her pathetic albums. Posted by: Sharon | May 30, 2007 02:20 PM I got about halfway though the feedback when I thought that more people seem to care about LL than real news. Maybe we should do something about that. And I'm not blaming the media. Posted by: m | May 30, 2007 02:25 PM I heart Liz. She has no ilk. Posted by: erm | May 30, 2007 03:50 PM I actually am impressed by LL's ability to outsmart the legal system. By leaving the scene, she is easily able to deny she was driving under the influence, deny that she was driving at all, and deny that any drugs found belong to her or any member of her posse. Leaving the accident site was brilliant. Posted by: Reedman | May 30, 2007 04:01 PM This un-douched looking, sad, sloppy drunk drug addict is getting on my nerves, occupying precious editorial space with no constructive image to project for young, decent girls today.

Posted by: Nick McCord | May 30, 2007 04:16 PM Since so many of these little starlets are jail-bound, who will fill their tiny stilletos next? Where are the 16- and 17-year-olds who will next hop onto the party wagon? That's the way Hollywood has always rolled - only back in the day, this stuff was covered up and there were fewer "star watch" reports. It's where youth is glorified and indulged - everyone's a kid, everyone's cool, and parents - man, what are they doing here?! Rules are for suckers! Partying rocks! Always has, whenever you get so many pretty people, so much money, and so little judgment (the "easy road" of acting calls to thousands every year) all together in one place. They usually leave all their anchors far away - family, day jobs, self-respect - and they drift without support networks in L.A. And there's no "there" there. Either that, or they were just dense to begin with, and can't say no. Posted by: Maritza | May 31, 2007 10:59 AM But she won't go away as long as we keep talking about her!

TMZ spotted mega-lawyer Blair Berk driving Lohan to the facility on Monday. Sources tell TMZ this is "a serious medical treatment program," not the in-and-out ruse used by other starlets in the recent past. We're told Lohan will be a resident at the facility, possibly for 30 days, but her outpatient treatment will last much longer. It would seem Lohan's next movie project may be , at least temporarily. We were told shooting was expected to start the day after tomorrow, but that almost certainly will not happen. A rep for Lindsay Lohan issued TMZ the following statement: "Lindsay admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility on Memorial Day. Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation and respect the privacy of Lindsay as well as the other patients receiving treatment at the facility." Rosie &ndash; I Was "Foster Kid" on "View" Rosie O'Donnell -- always wanting to get the last word in -- says that she probably won't speak to "View" combatant Elisabeth Hasselbeck again after their on-air slugfest, and that being on "The View" for the past year made her feel like "a foster kid." "I haven't spoken to her, and I think it's just as well" said Rosie on her video blog at . "I wrote her an e-mail, and she wrote me back, and there you have it." What's more, said O'Donnell, she compared her stint on "The View" to being "just like a foster kid for a year ... I didn't really fit into the family and now it's time for the foster kid to go back home." Rosie also confessed that the moustache left on the photo of Elisabeth was the work of her chief writer, Janette Barber, calling it "a joke on the way out." Mini Brit and Mini K-Fed Square Off Mini Britney has her very own pint-sized PopoZao -- a little person version of K-Fed. in Las Vegas this weekend where Terra Jole, aka Mini Britney Spears, rocked out to two of Ms. Spears' biggest hits, "Toxic" and "Oops ... I Did it Again," in her Brit-inspired flight attendant and red latex uniforms. It truly Mid-performance, a gold-chain, wifebeater-wearing, thugged-out Fed-alike (played by Wee Matt) took over the stage, and just like the couple's colossal counterparts, they argued! Mini Brit even offered some tender parting words to the lil' guy -- "Get the f**k outta here!" Cam and Jess -- Bitchfight Brewing? Cameron Diaz and Jessica Biel -- the ex GF and current paramour of Justin Timberlake -- will both be presenting at the upcoming MTV Movie Awards, reports , and handlers are doing everything "to keep Cam and Jess far apart," admitting that the situation is creating "a mess." You'll remember that Diaz got all up in JT's face when she saw him flirting with Biel at a Hollywood party back in January. But now that Timberlake is very publicly bringing sexy back with Biel, the triangle of stars will have to be very carefully managed. Says the source, "Cameron's looking a little unstable lately." Party Favors: Posh to Becks -- No Head Tattoo for You! ... Eighties Rock Legends Rock Cirque du Soleil ... Will Keira Play Princess Diana? Victoria Beckham has always stood by as hubby David Beckham overhauled his hairdo about, oh, every three months. But she's apparently drawn the hair-line at a tattoo of St. George and the Dragon that Becks wants on the back of his head. David, apparently, wants to make a big splash for his US soccer debut. ... It was '80s hair-metal heaven on Memorial Day at Cirque du Soleil's Beatles' " " at The Mirage in Las Vegas, when Tommy Shaw of Styx and Jack Blades of Night Ranger turned up -- and then rocked out at the Beatles Revolution lounge later on. ... Keira Knightley is being courted to play the late Diana, Princess of Wales, in a planned movie about her life based on the book "Diana and the Paparazzi," which was being shopped at Cannes.

What's with the club owners serving her? on May 29th 2007 by Jane 3. Well goody for her. At least she has the money to go to a cozy rehab. After 34 years of drug abuse I ended up on my own sofa going cold turkey! If anyone really wants to quit try that. I guarantee that after ten days of vomiting, dirrahea,cold sweats and pure out HELL they will remember what it's like. I've got 3 years under my belt and if noone else is proud of me I AM! on May 29th 2007 by bluengold 4. i hope lindsay spends her 21st birthday in jail. ahaha or in rehab again on May 29th 2007 by amy 5. SHE IS A LOST CASE!!! she is not even 21 and they are giving her drinks, just cause she is who she is(((( that is very sad)))) Club owners should get ticketed for that ... on May 29th 2007 by suri 6. I think Lindsay is wasting her talent on drugs like most "teens" starlets do. It shouldn't be like, "Oh what a druggie!" These news should shock us...drugs are trully affecting every aspect of our lives. As for bluengold: I am proud of you! I totally agree with you. My sister ended up in our couch, hallucinating wildly, vomitting, and looking like she was about to die! I was there....I had to babysitt her and take care of her at home rehab. on May 29th 2007 by Corina 7.

To Bluengold - Good for you! My hat is truly off to you for putting yourself through misery to clean up your act. There are lots of regular people and stars out there who could learn a good lesson from someone like you. Bravo! on May 29th 2007 by Jai 9.

I would point fingers and call names like the next person, but there's a bigger issue here. You'd think people like Ms. Lohan, and Ms. Spears, and everyone else who landed in rehab lately could spare themselves all this embarrassment if they simply learned from other people's mistakes. We've seen celebrities wreck their own careers--and sometimes lives--because someone didn't educate them about the pitfalls of fame. After all this time, SOMEONE must have amassed loads of information about those pitfalls; why no one made that information public is beyond me. As a hopeful bestselling author, I would like to use my eventual celebrity status to raise awareness of these problems. I see no reason for people, like Ms. Lohan, to put themselves through the wringer when they can easily avoid it. This way, they can still do what they love without harming themselves in the process. Oh--and the papers can go back to reporting on more relevant things, like the war in Iraq, the shambles of this latest presidential campaign, etc., etc. on May 29th 2007 by Please keep your comments relevant to this blog entry.

Monika Rawal and Radhika Das With the frenzy of the Miss Universe 2007 pageant over and Miss Japan Riyo Mori finally taking home the coveted title, the question foremost in everyoneâs minds is: when will India bring home the crown? When Indian contender Puja Gupta reached the Top 10, an entire nation couldnât help but be hopeful that maybe this time it would relive the glory. And rightly so. After Lara Dutta won the Miss Universe crown in 2000, none of her successors have been able to make a mark at the international beauty pageants. Miss India 2006 Neha Kapur did not make it to the Top 10 and even before that Celina Jaitley, Neha Dhupia, Nikita Anand, Tanushree Dutta and Amrita Thapar, did not live up to expectations. While the contestants and trainers feel that reaching the Top 10 is no small feat, why is the crown eluding Indiaâs beauties? Are there flaws in the selection process or has the contest become tougher? Has the selection committee become lenient in selecting or are Indian beauties losing their charm? According to Sabira Merchant, speech and diction trainer, the competition has become really tough but an important reason she feels is the lack of âthe right kind of girls who are prepared to compete at such a big platform. âNot many beautiful girls are coming forward for the Miss India pageants because they fear rejection. They have everything in them but they are not ready to give it a try and this is where we need to get strong. India needs the hidden talent to come out and try their luck without the fear of being rejected,â she adds. Sabira also feels that another reason could be the fact that Indian girls are pre-occupied with many other things and that is why they do not come forward to participate in beauty contests. âWith more and more avenues opening up for the glamour industry, girls enter directly into modeling and go abroad for shows and so on, so they are not coming in large numbers,â she asserts. Referring to Laraâs win in 2000, fashion designer Hemant Trivedi adds - on a slightly different note though, âI believe that one cannot keep doing great again and again and there can be reasons like a physical and intellectual difference that decides the winner. Most importantly, the contestants coming in for this pageant need to be more serious and from our end, we need to give them a better helping hand through training.â (Pic courtesy:/Miss Universe L.P., LLLP) Why is the crown eluding Indian beauties?

RELATED STORIES & LINKS Kevin Costner Takes On A Killer Role In Addition To Playing A Murderer, The Actor-Director-Golfer Adds Another Hyphenate: Musician Kevin Costner's Wife Has A Boy Actor's Wife Gave Birth To Cayden Wyatt Costner On Sunday Night Costner Is 'The Old Guy' Now! Plays Veteran Coast Guard Rescue Swimmer Teacher In 'The Guardian' The Case Of Kutcher Vs. Kutcher Ashton Kutcher Goes Up Against Himself This Weekend At The Box Office NEW YORK, May 30, 2007 WHAT DO YOU THINK? Kevin Costner has been making movies for 25 years and his roles have ranged from everything to an aging ballplayer in "Bull Durham," a medieval hero in "Robin Hood" and a renegade former Union solider in "Dances with Wolves." But the psychological thriller "Mr. Brooks" shows us a Costner we've never seen before. Costner stars as Earl Brooks, a successful business and family-man who is able to keep his murderous alter ego, played by William Hurt, at bay until a photographer played by Dane Cook sees him commit a crime. Photos: Kevin Costner Makes An Impression Much of the film's dialogue goes on in Earl's head. He and his alter ego argue about killing and confessing. "It's a movie that's a perfect storm of pressure," Costner told . "Has an (alter)-ego banging on him. He has Dane Cook, kind of a wanna-be, who is, in a way, more insidious." Serial killer movies are not the usual kind of films Costner makes and he said he won't even go see them. He chose "Mr. Brooks," which also stars Demi Moore as a detective working the case, because he said it has "some interesting entertainment value." "This one had this weird thing where you found yourself, I think, laughing appropriately," he said. "And yet you understood why you were laughing. And I think you end up with a lot of empathy. And so, for me, this movie's not any different than 'Field of Dreams' in a way. It's just, hopefully, an American classic." Costner said the story was presented to him in three parts  setting the stage for a sequel, something he has never done before. He wanted to know what the premise of the second movie would be even before the first one was made to make sure a series would work. But in the first movie his character never meets Moore, so the stage is set for a dramatic encounter somewhere down the line. While Costner, 52, has been working harder than ever on his career, his personal life is also progressing. He and his wife of three years, Christine, just gave birth to a son, Caden Wyatt, two weeks ago. He is named after Costner's movie "Wyatt Erp." "It's sweet. He's sweet," Costner said. "I told a story today to somebody that I woke up this morning  or yesterday when we flew into New York  woke up, was with him, looking at him, and he's so needy and so close. And then I got on the plane and I brought my two daughters who are 23 and 20 and they're so needy  and they both fell asleep in my lap, too. So it was like I had Caden, who is 2 weeks old, and then the five hours coming out here, there was Annie and Lilly  both took their turns." Costner said Christine, who is much younger than him, made it clear she wanted to have a family. Being a father a second time around isn't much different, Costner said, because even when he was building his career, he said he made time for his three older kids. "I went to all their games and I made that work around the movies and they were with me," he said. "I don't have to look back and go, 'Gee, doggone it.' So if anything, I thought I need to be as good to Caden as I feel like I was to those three. I have friends who said, 'The second time, I am really enjoying it.' I'm just really quiet in those conversations." © MMVII, CBS Interactive, Inc. All Rights Reserved. Now you're in the public comment zone.

News - Paula Abdul Says No to Drugs, Alcohol - Paula Abdul Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Paula Abdul Says No to Drugs, Alcohol Wed, 30 May 2007 04:12:49 PM PDT doth protest too much, we thinks. judge has denied yet again that her often bizarre behavior on the Fox show stems from drug or alcohol use. "I&#39;m sick of it. I&#39;ve never been drunk. I don&#39;t do recreational drugs. It&#39;s defamation of character," Abdul told magazine in its latest issue. Abdul, 44, has said in the past that she suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a rare neurological disorder that causes chronic pain. She claims the condition often keeps her up at night, leaving her exhausted and therefore more prone to making nonsensical statements. "If I appear exhausted on television, it&#39;s because I am! I have a lot of sleepless nights because I&#39;m in so much pain," she said. "I try to say something and I stumble, and that&#39;s what people have picked up on. I&#39;m not polished." Abdul&#39;s chronic pain began with a cheerleading accident when she was 17, and was exacerbated by a car accident caused by a drunk driver in 1987 and a plane crash in 1992. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I&#39;ve had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first-season finale of She said she manages the pain with anti-inflammatory medications, massage therapy and acupuncture. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul first revealed that she suffered from the condition in 2005 while responding to rampant speculation from posters on the message boards about her erratic behavior on the show. "It was time to set the record straight. I want America to know that I have never been addicted to anything, no chemical dependency, nothing for recreational purposes," she told In January, she again spoke up in her own defense after raising eyebrows by conducting a series of television interviews in which she slurred her words and appeared generally confused. She blamed the incident on a combination of factors, including an audio glitch and lack of sleep, but firmly denied that alcohol or drugs had anything to do with it. "Fatigue and exhaustion just added to the whole thing looking so disoriented. But no alcohol and no drugs, absolutely no!" Abdul told Robin Leach&#39;s Vegas-based blog, Luxe Life, at the time. "I just can&#39;t explain it, but for me, no excuses and no apologies." Despite the occasionally unwanted attention her judgeship has brought upon her, Abdul said that appearing on the show has been the most rewarding experience of her life. "Being a judge on overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she said. As for being the "nice one," in contrast to her fellow panelists , the former Laker Girl said it comes naturally. "My purpose is bringing out everybody&#39;s best and being that cheerleader to other people&#39;s success," she said.

For those people who say that she is a drug addict and a drunk, you have no credibility. You don't personally know her and don't know what her day to day activities are. Paula Abdul should not have to endure her pain AND have to deal with people calling her a drunk. She does not have to justify herself to anyone but she opted to set the record straight. Hope everything goes well for her. evanettie on 05/31/2007 7:53AM You GO GIRL. Paula R... You GO GIRL. Paula Rocks. We love you on Idol. All 3 of the panelist together as a team make Idol what it is.

I've often wondered if she suffers from a medical condition. Possibly something even more debilitating in the long term than the pain issue she describes? IF she did have a drug / alcohol abuse problem, you'd think someone would have come up with the proof by now. Michael J Fox didn't go public as soon as he was diagnosed.

It's Seth Rogen's turn to be the star. After his supporting role in , Steve Carell got the lead in Judd Apatow's . Now for his follow-up, sidekick Rogen gets the lead. He plays a stoner trying to start a celebrity nudity website (unbeknownst of Mrskin.com) who hooks up with the beautiful Katherine Heigl one night. Thanks to a condom mishap, she gets pregnant and now the broke loser has to step up. Even fake movie sex scenes with Katherine Heigl must have been awesome. Were they as great to shoot as it looked? Yeah, it&rsquo;s really kind of nerve wracking, you know. If I was 18 years old, I&rsquo;d literally be as far as I&rsquo;ve ever been with a girl. Essentially you&rsquo;re dry humping. I don&rsquo;t know if you can say that, but I&rsquo;ll say it. You&rsquo;re dry humping a girl who you don&rsquo;t know very well and I was just afraid I was going to sweat on her. That was my major concern, that I was going to drip a big gob of sweat on her head. It&rsquo;s nerves, but luckily they&rsquo;re comedic sex scenes, supposedly. So that kind of helps. It&rsquo;s not like I&rsquo;m supposed to be acting sexy. There&rsquo;s lines like, "This is my new record" in there so that kind of alleviates some of the pressure that would be put on me to look attractive and sexy, which is nice. or any other sex comedy an influence on you when you were a kid? Porky&rsquo;s, you mean the highest grossing Canadian film of all time! Yes, that was. Porky&rsquo;s was one of those films. When they played it in Canada, I would tape bits of it, the nude scenes and compile them. So I&rsquo;ve seen the nine minutes of Porky&rsquo;s where people are naked 1000 times over and over. The rest I&rsquo;ve recently caught up on, but that introduced me to adulthood, Porky&rsquo;s. What about other sex comedies? was a movie I always liked. It&rsquo;s pretty dirty for a Tom Hanks movie. There&rsquo;s some bestiality jokes in there and stuff like that, that would always shock me. Kevin Smith was an inspiration language wise, I would say. His movies were the first that I saw that people were cursing up a storm and that was very amusing to me, so I think we took a nod from that, definitely when it comes to sexual language anyway. Are you ready to be the lead in another romantic comedy? We&rsquo;ll see. I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s a strange concept, I guess, that romance is what people want to see me do but I had fun, I&rsquo;d keep doing it, sure! Were you familiar with the site Mr. Skin before making this movie? No&hellip;(long pause). Yes, of course I was. Originally in the movie, there was no Mr. Skin. I can&rsquo;t remember how it actually played out, but the movie originally took place in a universe that Mr. Skin did not exist, and it really started to amuse us, the notion that Mr. Skin did exist and we just hadn&rsquo;t heard of it. It just made us laugh a lot as we were writing, so that&rsquo;s where that kind of came from. Yeah, definitely, the idea for our webpage came from Mr. Skin. Was there as much improv here as in 40-Year-Old Virgin? Yes, there was tons of improv in all the scenes, especially the ones with me and my friends. We hired my actual friends because we always hope for those dynamics to kind of show on film. Our hope was to be able to tell we were all friends and we actually all know each other really well and the best way to get that stuff out is just through improv'ing and letting loose. The actual dynamics play out of it. Generally, we shoot the script once or twice and then we just kind of go off. Harold Ramis put it well, he was talking about it, and he said when he did and stuff, he would always say, "The script is the worst case scenario. The script is what we have if we can&rsquo;t think of anything better." That&rsquo;s pretty much what we do, and it was a pretty good script to begin with, so it was a pretty good worse case scenario we all thought. But, we basically said whatever came up. The whole Munich thing, that wasn&rsquo;t even implied in the script at all. That stuff just comes up as you&rsquo;re shooting. You're a new star to a lot of people, so what was your background? As far as my past goes, I started doing stand-up in Vancouver around when I was thirteen and then I got cast for , by Judd, when I was 16 and I moved to LA, and sunk my claws into him and haven&rsquo;t let go ever since. How outrageous and R-rated were you at age 13 when you were doing stand up in Vancouver? I was not. I was clean. I didn&rsquo;t work blue back then. Mostly because my mother came to a lot of my shows I think. I was just embarrassed. My life wasn&rsquo;t that R-rated back then, I guess. I tried to be truthful to what was going on with my life and my friends and my experiences. Then, it was more about my grandparents and playing video games and my Bar Mitzvah and stuff like that. I hadn&rsquo;t delved into the filthy world I now occupy. Where was it where you first did your stand up? At a lesbian bar in Vancouver called The Lotus. I thought it was Ladies Night. I didn&rsquo;t really get what was happening. How did a 13-year-old get hooked up in a lesbian bar? You sign up. The first time, there&rsquo;s actually a workshop that was being held at the bar where you go and basically learn. They tell you the loose format for writing a stand-up joke, and then at the end, you go and perform it for everyone. Then, from there, you just start getting invited out, someone there would say, "I know this other guy who runs this other comedy room," and "why don&rsquo;t you come and do 5 minutes." After that, you kind of get invited to do ten minutes and then you&rsquo;re kind of making 50 bucks a week and you don&rsquo;t need to work at McDonalds. How often are you writing? Pretty much when I&rsquo;m not acting, which is often, I guess. Or doing press. Yeah, as soon as I finish doing the Knocked Up promotion, I will start writing again. And between movies, that&rsquo;s kind of my default mode is sitting in my underwear writing. That&rsquo;s where I want to be, if no one else expects me to be anywhere else. Which creative hat do you enjoy the most? I&rsquo;ve got to say, with movies like Knocked Up, where I have significant amount of input and , which we just did, I really love doing them both. It&rsquo;s hard to pick one. Ideally, I&rsquo;d just keep doing this and be able to wear both hats at once. I view them, they&rsquo;re kind of the same thing to me. They&rsquo;re both kind of making movies, it&rsquo;s not really compartmentalized in two separate halves of my brain, really. It&rsquo;s all part of the same goal and I like to be as involved as I can. How raunchy is Superbad? It's all involving teens, according to the MPAA. That was the big thing. Our prime directive with Superbad was to bring back, unaware of where we were bringing it back from, movies like Fast Times. That stuff we really like and has a really relatable feel to it, and the language feels true to life. We hadn&rsquo;t really seen that when we started writing Superbad. We were 14 years old when we started writing it. It was born out of a very pure desire to see kids acting as how we acted on film, and speak how we speak and spoke. It just happened to be very dirty. And it&rsquo;s also just what made us laugh. When me and my writing partner, Evan Goldberg were writing it, we were teenagers in Vancouver. There was no real implication that it would ever get made into something. It was just to amuse ourselves. And unfortunately, really, really filthy jokes is what amuses us, so that&rsquo;s what we wrote. But, yeah, it was just born out of a desire to see teen characters act like what we acted like when we were in high school. What do you play in As far as Fanboys, I haven&rsquo;t seen the final movie. I play several kind of characters throughout it. My good friend, Jay Baruchel is in it, who is here today.Yeah, I don&rsquo;t know ultimately what my roles in that are. I hope they&rsquo;re funny. It seemed funny when we did it. What&rsquo;s it like to have the Freaks and Geeks gang back together? It&rsquo;s amazing. I don&rsquo;t know, it&rsquo;s funny, I look back to Freaks and Geeks and I&rsquo;m terrified how little thought I put into it. I think I was just young and inexperienced and it never really dawned on me that at this time, this was a really great show we were doing and these actors were amazing. It really just seemed so there and given. Looking back, it&rsquo;s a great show with some really talented people involved, and we all got along really well, so I think that&rsquo;s why we all want to keep working together. I just finished a movie with James Franco a few days ago, and it was amazing to be able to work together again. We kept looking at each other saying, "If you told us 8 years ago that someone would allow us to be in a movie that we&rsquo;re the stars of, I would have never believed it." It&rsquo;s amazing to us. How dirty is the humor in Sexually speaking, Pineapple Express is not nearly as dirty as Superbad or maybe even Knocked Up. It&rsquo;s not really a sexual movie. It&rsquo;s more of a marijuana themed, buddy/buddy, comedy, more in the tone of say, How action packed is it? I mean, action wise, it&rsquo;s pretty jammed packed. We&rsquo;ve got car chases and shoot-outs and explosions and me holding many machine guns, which is amusing to me. I hope other people find it entertaining, but when you say you&rsquo;re making an action comedy, it&rsquo;s like anything else. We thought it really has to function as really both as an action and as a comedy; with a romantic comedy, it needs to function in those worlds as well. We took that very seriously.

Christie's set a world record last year when Audrey Hepburn's iconic black dress sold for $932,178. Today, Christies's puts another dress from "Breakfast at Tiffany's" on the auction block: the hot pink cocktail dress worn by actress Audrey Hepburn when she learns that her brother Fred has been killed. Hepburn, portraying bohemian Holly Golightly, breaks down in a fit during the scene, throwing dishes and smashing pillows. The dress, silk with small rhinestones, is estimated to fetch $20,000 to $30,000 today at the auction and was on display during a preview of Film and Entertainment Memorabilia at Christie's auction house in New York, left.

BROOKS Interview: KEVIN COSTER TAPS HIS DARK SIDE FOR 'MR. BROOKS' Actor hates horror films, and loves working with William Hurt Kevin Costner abandons the films that he is known for and tackles a much darker role in the psychological thriller . Costner plays a man who is prone to giving himself over to his darker, homicidal side and as a result is being pursued by the authorities. iF MAGAZINE chatted with Costner about what drew him to this project, his loathing of scary movies, and working with his dark side William Hurt. iF MAGAZINE: What made you want to take on this kind of dark role we haven't really seen you in before? The decision was pretty simple. The movie, I thought, was the star. I thought the writing was the star of the movie, and I thought that while I didn't see myself like that person, I thought I could do this, you know? And so when I make up my mind, first and foremost, is it a movie...Because even though you have to professionally cover movies, I&rsquo;m sure that deep down you do love movies, and probably love movies when they surprise you. And I think that this movie kind of, on paper, I thought it had all those moments. If we embraced them and went for them, I understood that it would be seen as a departure. [Laughs] I understood all the things that would come with it, but I still felt like, if I&rsquo;m going to make a life of making movies, then I should try to make different kind of movies. And this seemed to fit in a positive way. iF: Did you consider directing this? I thought about that, but when I realized what the pedigree of the project was, that the writers who wrote it wanted to direct it, then we had a discussion about that. I could have done that, but in this instance, this was important for him to direct. And I've worked with a lot of first-time directors, writer/directors, and I thought, "I'll give this a chance." iF: Did you decide right away that you wanted to produce it as well? I knew that without a doubt that I would have to do that. I knew that I would also have to have final cut on it. If you like the movie, the odd things about it I knew would be things that would be cut first. If you don't like blood, blood would be gone. If you don't like this, that would be gone. Because they ask audiences, "What do you like?" "I don&rsquo;t like this." But I thought that this piece was dark. It&rsquo;s insidious, what it is. Even though we ashamedly find ourselves laughing at some moments, the oddity of it, I felt that it needed to be true to itself, and I didn't want to see it...If no one else wanted to make this movie and I wanted to make it, why would I let anybody try to flatten it out and make it more generic? So while I know maybe some longtime people who&rsquo;ve enjoyed my movies might be offended by this, might think that it&rsquo;s too harsh, I get that, and I accept that. But I don't want to cater to my audience, I just want to feed it, you know? Take or not take it. It&rsquo;s an honest effort.

And were you familiar with his stand-up? I wasn't familiar with his stand-up. And I'm actually glad, because I don't completely understand his stand-up all the time. But I understand him, and I understand his desire to not be pigeonholed, be conformed. And he read for me. He read for this movie. He did all the things that someone who has a bigger idea about their career does. They want something that they see themselves being a part of something unique, and he did, and that's why he got the part. And he was sensational in it. iF: Do you see a little of Mr. Brooks in yourself? Well, the things that we all see in ourselves in Mr. Brooks are that we would all go defend our daughter. Mad as hell, but we would go kill for them. And so there are things that...Mr. Brooks isn't looking for forgiveness. "Oh, don't you see that I'm really a nice guy?" No, he&rsquo;s not. He has a disease. When that disease isn't working, he is a nice guy. But the families that he's dismantled&hellip;that kind of thing that families are destroyed forever--mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters...We don't really deal with that. We have to know in our hearts that that's what is...That's why we can't ever forgive him. But what Brooks is successful at, I think, is that it creates a certain kind of empathy. And empathy always comes in our life when we have a level of understanding. You may not like the serial killer, can never forgive him. He destroyed your girlfriend's life forever, blah blah blah, "I hate him, I wish he never was born,&rdquo; You might know him and know that he was assaulted and abused since he was 3 years old. And you can't forgive him either, and you can't say anything to her, but in your heart, you go, "That poor f**ker never had a chance." You have empathy because you have a level of understanding of him. And so in movies, we can create a level of understanding if we choose to invest in a character. And that's what made Mr. Brooks stand out to me as a serial killer movie. Because I don&rsquo;t like serial killer movies. I don't like scary movies. I get scared. I'm uncomfortable. I don't like roller coasters or sh** like that. I don't like being scared. It's not an adrenaline rush for me. So Mr. Brooks really had to pass a lot of things for me to want to even be a part of it. And it did. iF: Were you concerned that Marshall might overwhelm this movie? Well, I knew it was a really flashy role. And I very often take movies that have scene-stealing roles all around me, and I relish that. I think that's important for movies. I don't get scared by that stuff. I encourage the actors to be really good around me. I want that to happen. And I want them to do it inside the lines of the movie. And so when I see a great role, I want to go for a great actor. A great actor recognizes a great role. It just raises the whole level of the movie. I want to go to that for a second. It is a pleasing role. And you know, sometime the temptation is, in American movies now, conventional wisdom is they'll ask you, "What scene did you hate the most?" And you'll tell them. "What scene did you like the most?" In modern day filmmaking, that scene you hated the most goes flying out of the movie. But that doesn't mean it should have. It gives the movie a balance. And they might ask you about characters, and you say, "Well, I really like Marshall the most." Then an executive goes, "Let's write some more scenes for Marshall." I think Marshall was in there just perfectly. Just perfectly. iF: How was it playing those scenes opposite William Hurt? It was fun. I mean, I've known William because of , and we both are rehearsal-oriented actors, and writer-driven actors. So it fit into our game really nicely. iF: Was Marshall based on somebody? Yes. Marshall was based on a...I found Marshall when I was 12 years old in a book of children's dreams. And he would play basically a Black Knight, an evil person. But I liked him so much in the book because he was kind of cool. And I liked him so much; actually, I was afraid he was going to die in the book, so I never finished it. And my father used to discipline me with the idea that if I wasn't good, that the Black Knight would come and get me. That it would come and get me that it actually hid in my closet. And like any young man, eventually you challenge your dad's theory and you open that closet. And there was my imaginary friend, and he was not scary at all to me. And so he's been with me. Sort of my alter ego. And that began when I was 12 years old Bruce had only directed one film prior to Mr. Brooks. iF: What did he do to convince you that visually he could accomplish this? Well, I didn't look at his other movie. [Laughs] I didn't want to. Because once I committed to him as a director, I wanted to try to support him, and I didn't want to get panicked. I mean, I had heard different things. I didn't want to jade that. Once I gave him my word that he would get a chance to direct it, I wanted to back that up. But I wanted also to protect the movie by keeping final cut. Your Comments are always welcomed here Tell us what you think? Log In to leave your comments! You must be logged in to enter comments.

Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News dancing with the stars Wed, 30 May 2007 03:48:19 PM PDT That was no blockbuster opening for The reality show about aspiring filmmakers got squashed like going up against the new Pirates of the Caribbean movie, averaging just 6.4 million viewers in its first two broadcasts. In the case of Dancing with the Stars . In a head-to-head matchup last week, ABC&#39;s ballroom competition bested Fox&#39;s screening-room competition, 23 million viewers (third place) to 7.6 million (28th place), per the latest weekly Nielsen Media Research rankings released Wednesday. And while it&#39;s one thing to lose out to a hot property like &mdash;on its Apolo Anton Ohno-celebrating night, no less&mdash;it&#39;s another thing to lose out while airing after -Mark Burnett pedigree, both moguls are executive producers on the show, was picked to premiere following &#39;s penultimate episode. In the 8 p.m. Tuesday time slot, the Blake Lewis-Jordin Sparks sing-off averaged 25.3 million (second place). Then came along at 9 p.m., and there went Fox&#39;s audience&mdash;the show went on to lose 70 percent of its &#39;s results were worse: 5.2 million viewers (51st place). On the upside, Thursday&#39;s merely lost 45 percent of its lead-in, the season premiere of summer&#39;s typically sturdy So You Think You Can Dance (20th place, 9.5 million). was announced with much press-release fanfare in April 2006. The hook was not so much the concept&mdash;although its premiere was novel in that it eschewed the usual -celebrated funny/bad auditions&mdash;but the names: Spielberg, the Oscar-winning legend, and Burnett, the guru. Neither, however, was on hand for the opener, outside of their names in the end credits. and Garry Marshall supplied the recognizable faces&mdash;all were judges, none was a brutal . (Since last week&#39;s debut, there&#39;s been one switch: original host Chelsea Handler was swapped out for Adrianna Costa.) Set to air through the summer, says it&#39;ll give its winner a $1 million deal with DreamWorks. Maybe after, he or she can come up with a hit reality show. Elsewhere, in ratings highlights for the TV week ended Sunday: This is its now: &#39;s Sparks-flying finale (30.7 million viewers, first place) averaged nearly 6 million viewers less than last season&#39;s Taylor Hicks-coronation, and nearly 7 million viewers less than this season&#39;s inaugural episode. (sixth place, 13.9 million), NBC&#39;s (eighth place, 13.5 million), and ABC&#39;s (10th place, 12.7 million) all made it back into the top 10. Now, if they can arrange it so they always air really important episodes (i.e., finales) in a week where about half the series have begun their rerun vacations, they can take up permanent residence there. might want to reset its coordinates. In January, its season premiere averaged 15.8 million; last week, its season finale averaged 10.3 million (15th place). (42nd place, 5.5 million) isn&#39;t a hit, but it sure does make Grandma happy. Jesse Stone: Sea Change (ninth place, 13 million) was, in fact, a hit. Bingo&#39;s fun and all, but Grandma really loves her some Did you know NBC has started burning off its supply of unused s? Judging by the ratings in its Thursday-night premiere (76th place, 3.9 million), probably not. (78th place, 3.5 million) is still a lousy rerun, but at least now it has company from (86th place, 3.1 million). helped make ABC the highest-rated network among young women, aged 18-49, at least for the week of May 14, aka Rosie O&#39;Donnell&#39;s last full week of work. Overall, the smaller than usual finale was more than big enough to lift Fox to weekly wins as both the most watched network (11.6 million) and the highest rated network among young adults. The first half of the week constituted the final days of the 2006-07 season; the second half of the week constituted the first days of prime-time&#39;s summer. CBS finished second in viewers (9 million), while ABC took second in the demo, thanks to , though, could take ABC higher than third place in viewers; the network averaged 8.7 million.) NBC (5.6 million) claimed a pair of fourth-place finishes, aired the least watched non-sports show on the big four networks (a Sunday rerun of &mdash;91st place, 2.2 million), and switched entertainment presidents after, per slate.com, an anonymous tipster leaked word of the network&#39;s plan to switch entertainment presidents. But other than that... Law & Order: SVU (16th place, 10.3 million) enjoyed an okay season finale.

It can net you a movie deal -- and some very harsh public criticism. Eleven-year-old Jamison Stone of Alabama became the darling of a slow news cycle when over the Memorial Day weekend news agencies across the country published a photo of the apple-cheeked boy grinning over the gigantic carcass of a 10-foot boar. Hog Wild! Feral Pigs Invade Texas Wild Pigs Menace U.S., Whet Appetites in Europe Another Natural Threat to Florida: Feral Hogs The publicity prompted his father, Mike Stone, to create a Web site that features photos of the boy and his trophy, dubbed Monster Pig. It's also earned Jamison a bit part in an upcoming film "The Legend of Hogzilla," based on the tale of a superpig gunned down in Georgia in 2004. With fame, however, comes criticism. The Stones have been accused of everything from doctoring photos to make the pig look bigger to unnecessarily torturing an animal. "We've gotten a lot of negative e-mail," Mike Stone told ABCNEWS.com. "People have said they want to see my boy killed in a hunting accident and gutted like a pig." In the negative comments section of their Web site, monsterpig.com, one angry visitor wrote: "Hurry up and enlist in the Army, I want to see you chased and shot at. And maybe beheaded on video for us to see. â¦ I will laugh while eating my veggie burger." Another anonymous e-mail reads: "If you ate that pig, I hope it was carrying some kind of disease. The world would be better off without people like you." According to the 2000 census, some 1.7 million children between the ages of 6 and 15 years old hunt in the United States. Nevertheless, the idea of an 11-year-old chasing a boar on a fenced-in hunting ground for three hours and shooting it nine times with a handgun has many asking questions about the ethics of letting children hunt. It also brings into sharp relief different attitudes about hunting in different parts of the country. PeTA, or People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, gave Stone the Worst Dad in the Country Award "for not only teaching his son how to kill but also doing further harm by showing him how to make animals suffer." "We look to parents to teach their kids empathy and compassion," said Daphna Nachminovitch, a PeTa spokeswoman. "This animal was not killed humanely; it was tortured. We oppose killing of animals for entertainment." Criticism and Congratulations for Boy Who Slew 'Monster Pig' Read All 154 Comments and Post Your Own WHAT OTHERS ARE SAYING Add to the facts.

Life must be tough when you&#39;re as successful as Justin Timberlake. All the goals you&#39;ve set yourself have been attained and even the ridiculous ones you just made up to pass the time - Enrage the woman from A Life Less Ordinary ? Check. Impress one of the world&#39;s most beautiful women with a date at Nando&#39;s ? Sadly, check - are being seen through with ridiculous ease. So what&#39;s left for Justin Timberlake now that he has everything he could ever wish for? Thankfully, Justin&#39;s brief infatuation with seems to have passed - leaving him to concentrate on what he does best. Well, OK, not . Most frequently. Anyway, we&#39;re talking about music. Justin Timberlake has always been keen to help out other artists, like the Black Eyed Peas, Nelly Furtardo, Timbaland and - just to shut everyone up for a second - . But now Justin Timberlake is turning his interest legitimate with Tennman Records, a new record label that Justin has set up with Interscope. There have been plenty of quotes about Tennman from all sorts of record executives, but they&#39;re all full of identical backslappy business-speak so we won&#39;t print them. Instead, here&#39;s what Justin Timberlake has to say on the matter: &ldquo;We are all excited about the talent we have to offer already on our roster, and I cannot wait to introduce the world to my new discoveries.&rdquo; Not that we can see how Justin Timberlake will be able to commit too much time to Tennman Records though - he&#39;s also apparently busy producing tracks for &#39;s next album, looking to star in more rubbish films that nobody watches and performing any number of attention-seeking that he can get his hands on. Best of luck to Justin Timberlake and Tennman Records, and we look forward to hearing the label&#39;s first release - a song called Justin&#39;s Bringing Sexy Back The Dynamite Justin Timberlake Majorette All-Star Squadron (Featuring Justin Timberlake) Timberlake Launching Own Record Label - Justin Timberlake Makes Some Wonderful Clothes Or Something Justin Timberlake &#038; Cameron Diaz Still Not Splitting Up Cameron Diaz &#038; Justin Timberlake Back Together, But Probably Not Justin Timberlake Not Just Back, He&#8217;s SexyBack Justin Timberlake Chavs Around To Impress Jessica Biel Cameron Diaz Ain&#8217;t Never Getting Married Justin Timberlake &#038; Cameron Diaz Give Each Other The Shaft Justin Timberlake Pleased About Gay Lance Bass This entry was posted on Wednesday, May 30th, 2007 3:30 pm and is filed under .

The deal is estimated to be worth $370 million in cash, according to sources familiar with the talks. Email to a friend Famous Music's catalog of more than 125,000 songs and sound cues includes music by Eminem and Shakira as well as movie soundtracks from "The Godfather" and "Mission Impossible." Famous was founded as a unit to publish songs from movies. The deal is the first major move by recently appointed Sony/ATV Chief Executive Martin Bandier, the former head of EMI Music Publishing, who left EMI earlier this year. As part of the deal, Sony/ATV will be entering the production music business through the Famous Extreme division. Sony/ATV is jointly owned by Sony Corp. and Jackson. Its catalog includes songs by The Beatles, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan and Jimi Hendrix, making it the fourth-largest music publisher. Bandier, who oversaw the growth of EMI Music Publishing from No. 4 publisher to the largest when he left, said he was appointed to expand the business through a mix of acquisitions and the addition of songwriters. "We're in the hunt for great artists and people to build the team," said Bandier in an interview with Reuters. "This deal announces that we're in the game. Our strategy is to become one of the more meaningful players in the publishing business," he added. Sony/ATV bought the Leiber Stoller songs catalog last month in a deal industry experts valued at around $50 million. The songs, by iconic songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, include "Hound Dog," "Jailhouse Rock," Stand By Me" and Love Potion #9." Music publishing has become one of the more coveted segments of the music industry as recorded music has been severely hit by piracy. It has been affected by the relatively slow transition of consumers to buying digital songs to make up for the downturn in sales of CDs. Publishing is less vulnerable to the vagaries of music retailing as it generates revenue by licensing songs to a variety of sources, including television, advertising, radio and live performances. Earlier this month, French media giant Vivendi SA's Universal Music Publishing Group unit became the world's largest music publisher after it bought BMG Music Publishing in a $2.19 billion deal. Other music companies have also said they intend to expand their publishing catalog, including Warner Music Group and Sony BMG Music Entertainment. John Mayer acts out a bizarre ...

"I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on `American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of `American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul _ who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s _ says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of `American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer." Fox is a unit of News Corp. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

News - Mischa Barton Better After Memorial Day Mixer - Mischa Barton | Nicole Richie Shop @ E! Online You are not signed in. Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News Mischa Barton Better After Memorial Day Mixer Wed, 30 May 2007 10:43:12 AM PDT has apparently been given the all-clear. star spent about two hours in a Los Angeles-area hospital over the weekend, after falling ill at &#39;s Memorial Day barbecue. Barton&#39;s publicist says the starlet suffered an adverse reaction after consuming a few cocktails on top of the prescription antibiotics she was taking for a persistent case of bronchitis. "She is fine now," said a statement from publicist Leslie Sloane Zelnik. The statement said Barton left Tuesday for an undisclosed overseas location to begin work on a new movie. No further details were available regarding her condition, but a source told TMZ that the 21-year-old Barton was "resting comfortably" shortly after being admitted to Sherman Oaks Hospital and that her mother and sister were by her side throughout. The star of the upcoming period romance has reportedly been battling bronchitis for the past several weeks, appearing under the weather in Cannes, Paris and London. In a radio interview with E!&#39;s Wednesday, Richie, who hosted the bash at a friend&#39;s house, said she was not there when Barton fell ill because she was making a run to the grocery store at the time. "She&#39;s good. She just mixed antibiotics and alcohol and got sick," Richie said. Since the party, the star has been busy doing damage control on her own behalf after the intentionally silly party invitation she sent out to friends fell into the wrong set of tabloid-editing hands. "My fellow Americans it&#39;s that time of year to celebrate our country by drinking massive amounts of beer," the invitation began. "Let&#39;s stand together as one, live the American dream/Take shots, pass out, & wake up with our pants ripped open at the seems/Let&#39;s glorify this day in your sluttiest tops and your tightest pair of tsubi jeans/Even though we have no [expletive] clue what Memorial Day really means!!" Followed by this addendum: "There will be a scale at the front door. No girls over 100 pounds allowed in. Start starving yourself now. See you all then!!!" Richie was unapologetic about the invite, telling Seacrest it was meant to be funny and was never meant to become public. "It&#39;s a private email. I&#39;m sending it to my friends as a joke. I didn&#39;t mean to make it public and I have every right to say what I want to my friends," she said. "It&#39;s not that deep. I wanted to write something that rhymes. I don&#39;t even know what to say about it. I&#39;m not a serious person at all and no one thinks that I am." Her rep, Nicole Perna, backed her up, stating: "This invitation was sent via email to her friends who understand that she was responding in a joking manner to the constant untruths printed about her in the media. "Her reference to Memorial Day was in no way meant to offend anyone but was simply an expression of her distaste for the current situation." Richie was at a loss as to which of the many friends on her invite list forwarded her missive on to unintended recipients. "It really makes me question who I trust in my life," she said.

Has anyone else noticed that the publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, seems to represent most of these "spoiled, drunk, drugged out Hollywood stars"??! She should revisit her decision to work with most of these "starlets" and be a "TRUE" adult by making them straighten out or leave them high and dry when it comes time to do some "creative PR". Just my two cents! Choosylover1968 on 05/30/2007 11:55AM nicole richie is hila... nicole richie is hilarious. if you've ever watched "The Simple Life" you know this. This invite is funny, if a comedian had said this no one would complain. relax, it's ok to laugh at this. AnnieJ456 on 05/30/2007 10:28AM I think she's a mess.... I think she's a mess. Not only was the invite in poor taste, but her comment concerning the meaning of Memorial Day was offensive to the families and friends of military personnel, whether deceased, retired or currently serving this country. I personally see nothing cute or funny about it. Just my opinion. ciscomama on 05/30/2007 9:38AM I actually think her ... I actually think her invite is quite funny! Atleast she can poke fun at herself and have a sense of humor about the whole media situation. This makes me look at Nicole in a wholenew way - she's a funny girl!

Entertainment Inc. and the Universal Orlando Resort said they will open a theme park in Florida based on the Harry Potter novels in late 2009. The park, called the Wizarding World of Harry Potter, will feature rides, shops and attractions from the books that follow the adventures of the teenage wizard, the companies said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire. The village of Hogsmeade, the mysterious Forbidden Forest and Hogwarts castle will be recreated. ``The plans I&#39;ve seen look incredibly exciting, and I don&#39;t think fans of the books or films will be disappointed,&#39;&#39; Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling said in the statement. The Harry Potter books have been translated into 65 languages, with more than 325 million copies sold worldwide. The seventh and final installment, ``Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,&#39;&#39; will be published on July 21. Four Harry Potter films, produced by Warner Bros.

Paula Abdul says she didn't figure out her purpose in life until she became a judge on Fox network's "American Idol." NEW YORK- Paula Abdul says she didn't figure out her purpose in life until she became a judge on Fox network's "American Idol." "I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on 'American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of 'American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul&mdash;who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s&mdash;says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of 'American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer." Fox is a unit of News Corp.

Sony disputed the record, saying that its Spider-Man 3 still held the six-day record because Pirates was actually released a day earlier than scheduled in both France and Italy, Variety reported. Spider-Man 3 earned "just" 382 million dollars during its first six days and 418 million dollars in the first seven days. Mark Zoradi, president of motion-picture marketing and distribution for Walt Disney Studios, said the massive ticket sales showed that Pirates has "truly become a cultural phenomenon all over the world." "The global box office returns have continued to exceed our expectations and estimates," he was quoted by DPA as saying. The film&#039;s performance was especially strong internationally, where it earned 251 million dollars, 62 per cent of its take. It boasted record-breaking openings in 17 territories, including Argentina, Ecuador, Holland, Iceland, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Latvia, Malaysia, Norway, Panama, Russia, Slovenia, Spain, Taiwan, Ukraine and Venezuela. The movie is yet to open in two key markets: India, where it launches Friday, and China, where it opens June 10.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/3-6&fd=R&url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amanda-guinzburg/split-scene_b_49864.html&cid=1116563655&ei=jv1eRsO-FY-oqgO5vv3PDQ Amanda Guinzburg: Split Scene | The Huffington Post Posted May 29, 2007 Every time Rosie O'Donnell would walk on stage during 's opening, she made a gesture of feigned shock that there were all these people wildly applauding for her. She would turn her hands upwards and furrow her brow in exaggerated confusion and then as she'd continue out towards the table (trailed by the other consistently waving co-hosts), her open Irish face would break into a bright wide smile. She was, it seemed from the very start, saying to everyone who watched: I am going to take you with me now, into the land of bright lights, quick touch-ups and major league pretend. But doing that while still following the rest of the rules of network television proved ultimately an impossible balancing act for a woman who has remarkably balanced a great deal. Or rather a task whose compromises, not just of time away from her beloved family (a family, it can safely be said, she made a natural part of morning conversation despite the fact that it is unconventional by traditional -- and it would seem now, in large part thanks to her -- almost archaic standards) but of her fiercely held moral standards of what is right and what is real. Television has taken almost every ounce of reality away from the very genre so named. We are all supposed to be in on the joke now -- that everything we see is edited and manipulated to serve some larger narrative. To wit: the debauched kids on MTV's Real World: The Moon ! (Not really, but they're seriously running out of places to house these drunken whores), the wrecked and weeping women riding away mascara-streaked in limousines after being dumped by the latest Bachelor, or the ever available desperados of afternoon talk shows. Jerry Springer is still perhaps the most extreme, and even he now has his own meta-show, where we see that guests are so heavily prepped by producers they're actually told at what point to physically attack their cheating spouse (when the lie detector or DNA test comes back positive) or racist neighbor (when he or she inevitably and often gleefully uses the "n" word) For Rosie what is real is synonymous with the truth and the truth is as precious a commodity as it is rare, at least in the realm of show business. On her heavily trafficked website, she often writes about things like feeding geese, befriending squirrels, baby birds hatching in a corner of her roof, her wife's conservative family, her children's small triumphs and the ordinary people she encounters' various struggles to survive. She puts her money where her mouth is and consistently gives it away, threatening to fire her financial advisors should she ever wind up on a Richest Celeb list. But she's also fully recognized and taken advantage of the national audience she regained by joining this year, speaking out and devoting whole hours to issues like depression, autism, and the devastating illnesses now ravaging the 9/11 first responders. Then there is The War. Rosie has relentlessly, with unmistakable rage and palpable grief refused, despite Barbara Walter's awkward discomfort with it, to stop speaking out about this criminal administration and the Iraq War it made up, dressed up, and sold to our nation. "WAKE UP, AMERICA!" Rosie has, for years now, commanded from within the sometimes-confusing typographical trenches of her blog. Despite the fact that the media's manipulations drove her from the very show she reinvented, Rosie's fights with Elisabeth Hasselbeck did nothing if they did not wake us up. They were riveting in their rawness and to the extent one side of them ever seemed prepped, Rosie made no attempt to hide her disgust with such executively borne machinations. On what O'Donnell has since called Nuclear Wednesday, Hasselbeck made an analogy about a deadline for pulling out of the war and a timed football pass. Nothing could have articulated more clearly what Rosie seemed to find so anathema about this woman's politics and ultimately her personal comportment. While Elisabeth appeared to almost relish the supposed gamesmanship of their political throw downs -- going off to do sound bytes for the nightly "entertainment" show after Wednesday's meltdown and assuring the public she wasn't "mad" and that they would most definitely remain friends, they wore Rosie O'Donnell so far down you could literally see it in her eyes. They grew distant long before that eventual (and perhaps inevitable) dÃ©nouement. Rosie said it was the split screen that was the final nail in her coffin. It makes sense. The split screen implied that these feelings and ideas Rosie holds so dear and was trying, so very hard it seemed, to communicate to Elisabeth (but also to anyone who had ever twisted her words to serve their personal agenda) about truth and justice and loyalty and humanity could be turned into an empty gesture of celluloid commercialism: Selling Rosie as the worst and most dishonest caricature of herself, one side of a two dimensional screen. Kind of like what the government has done to our nation. Every day veracity is under siege in America as the current administration tries to warp what's actually happening while the vast majority of our mainstream media remains complicit with their systematic airbrushing of the bloody facts. We who compulsively tuned into the video blog she began a few weeks ago with her quirky long time producer-cum-mustache artist and giant-turkey-wing-eating hair stylist saw that Rosie was clearly far more at ease back stage, behind closed doors with a face naked of all concealers, singing along to Amy Winehouse or Tina Turner and answering some of the thousands of questions she gets daily than she ever would be out on that carefully orchestrated studio set. I am confident, however, that Rosie will return. Not to , but to the unmatched power that is television. She'll don the necessary war paint and head out under the hot white lights and blinking audience signs. She may act more or less surprised that people still love her, despite and because of her rage. The fact is this: A steadfast quest to reveal what is really real requires Rosie stay out here, on the front lines of truth.

'Pirate Master' looks to kidnap viewers Posted Sunday, March 01, 1987 Posted Sunday, March 01, 1987 Posted Thursday, May 31, 2007 In the '90s, there were Beanie Babies. In the '80s, Rubik's Cubes. In the '70s, kids went streaking. But, in the current day, at the end of the long list of ridiculous fads, what is it all of a sudden with pirates? All right, me buckos. I might remember "Pirates of the Caribbean" as a somewhat seamy ride at Disneyland, but nowadays it's a blockbuster movie franchise, currently on its second sequel with no signs of slowing down. So, of course, all of pop culture wants to jump on the bandwagon - or, excuse me, come aboard and climb the mast to the crow's nest. Of course, that means the most trendy of all media genres, reality TV, horning in on the action. Ergo "Pirate Master," a new competitive series produced by the impresario of reality TV, Mark Burnett of "Survivor" and "The Apprentice." It debuts in the "Survivor" time slot at 7 p.m. today on CBS' WBBM Channel 2. Sixteen contestants will be thrown together on a 179-foot sailing ship as it cruises the Caribbean circling the island of Dominica. The show features the usual reality shenanigans (there will be a pirate captain assigning duties each week, and a Pirate Court at the end of each episode, with one contestant "cut adrift" or made to "walk the plank" by host Cameron Daddo, the Aussie Jeff Probst of the competition). And a final contestant in the $1 million race will claim about half the booty by finding the buried treasure at the end. Contestants set sail seeking treasure (and summer ratings) in CBS' new reality series "Pirate Master." Of course, the real treasure is Nielsen ratings, which the major networks have been pursuing for years with a map made from cheap reality shows. "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," "Survivor," "The Apprentice": They all began as summer replacement series. Now CBS is hoping to strike gold again - or at least come across a few shiny doubloons before it descends into the summer doldrums again with "Big Brother." The "buried" part of it is that, like many reality shows, "Pirate Master" is produced on the fly and relatively on the cheap, so review copies were not made available to critics before this week. Instead, CBS e-mailed out a highlights reel with the contestants talking about themselves. And suddenly it seems everyone has a little pirate in them - some more than others. "Pirates are thrill-seekers, and I'm definitely a thrill-seeker," says Los Angeles bartender Elicia "Jupiter" Mendoza. "My 20s have been a whole lot of pirating - boozing, pillaging," says Laguna Beach, Calif., fashion publicist Alexis Shubin. Even Nevada district attorney Cheryl Kosewicz identifies with pirates, saying, "I have to be able to be evil in order to do what I do." Evidently, there's more than a little pirate in network programmers as well. "I really do believe I'm the smartest guy in the room," says John Lakness of Massachusetts, "but I really have to as a matter of self-confidence." How much confidence does he have? Well, when he's not paying the bills with his straight gig as a scientist, he's a Chippendale dancer. Uh, John, I don't know how to break this to you, but it's not that kind of booty. Although it certainly could be. As ever, Burnett figures to plant the seeds of romance where there aren't any with his creative editing. Already we have El Lay dive master Kendra Guffey saying, "I'm really, really competitive - especially when it comes to men." Shiver me timbers. Well, don't say you haven't been warned. Maryland marina owner Louie Frase might admit, "I don't know what we're gonna be doing, but I tell you what. I'm gonna strap myself in ... and go for the ride." Yet that doesn't mean a viewer has to be spirited along with him like Jim Hawkins. My advice: Stay cool and lie low and the pirate fad will pass, like Pet Rocks and Cabbage Patch Kids before them.  Ted Cox ( ) writes Tuesday and Thursday in Suburban Living, Friday in sports and Friday in Time out!

Mori later moved to Belleville, Ont., to complete Grade 12 at a school with a dance program. Riyo Mori attended high school in Victoria.

She is remembered by de Boer as "quite spontaneous. We've had quite a few Japanese students and they vary a lot. Some of them are really shy. They don't know much English and they don't participate and stay in their room a lot of the time. "Riyo wasn't like that. Her English was good. She went to Mount Doug here and she did well, better than some other students we had." He said Mori's grandmother made a prediction years ago that she would be Miss Japan before she was 20, and being named Miss Universe will make Mori's dream of opening a dance school a reality. "I don't have much doubt that she'll achieve what she wants to," de Boer said. Mount Douglas counsellor Cheryl Chapple was thrilled to see Mori named Miss Universe because of her inner beauty. "I think more than anything, it wasn't looks that jumped out but it was her sweetness. She's just a lovely, sweet, very hard-working girl." Mori won the Miss Universe on Monday. Prizes include a diamond and pearl crown valued at $250,000. Â© The Vancouver Sun 2007 John Mayer acts out a bizarre ... Privacy czar warns web users to be wary Students cruising online networking...

News Doing the Booing Americans Won&#39;t Do Wed May 30, 3:00 AM ET The United States government is on the verge of approving a mass amnesty to millions of illegal aliens &mdash; a plan pushed aggressively by meddling Mexican officials who reap billions of dollars in remittances (illegal aliens&#39; earnings sent back to Mexico) without having to lift a finger to clean up their own country. And the thanks we get? Internationally televised public humiliation. On Monday night, the beautiful young woman who represented America in the pageant was booed and mocked as she competed on stage in Mexico City. Rachel Smith, 22, did her best to respond with grace and dignity during the Top Five finalists&#39; interview segment as the audience disrupted the event. As soon as co-host Vanessa Minnillo invited to pick a judge&#39;s name from a bowl of index cards, widespread howls broke out at the mere mention of "USA." The verbal derision continued as judge Tony Romo asked Smith to pick one moment in her life she would relive. Definitely not this one. Smith soldiered through her answer, describing an educational trip to South Africa. Catcalls and whistles nearly drowned out Smith&#39;s reply until she wrapped up with " I wouldn&#39;t have been so polite. None of Miss USA&#39;s fellow Americans participating in the interview segment &mdash; neither Minnillo, nor macho co-host Mario Lopez, nor the dashing Romo &mdash; came to Smith&#39;s defense. Instead, Minnillo pleaded briefly with the unruly mob: "Okay, una momento, por favor. " Lopez stood mute with a dumb grin on his dimpled face. Pathetic. In fact, Smith was subjected to anti-American hatred throughout the week-long event. Last week, during the contestants&#39; national costume fashion show, Smith smiled bravely as a rowdy outdoor crowd hissed and booed at her. According to pageant observers, no other contestants received such treatment. Pitifully, Donald Trump and his Miss Universe officials are downplaying Smith&#39;s experience &mdash; ignoring the fact that the last time the pageant was held in Mexico, Miss USA was abused in similar fashion. 1993 Miss USA Kenya Moore was infamously heckled when chosen for the semi-finals that year. Just a tiny minority of America-haters, right? How quickly we forget. Do you remember what happened in Guadalajara in 2004 during an Olympics qualification soccer match between the U.S. and Mexico? The stadium erupted in boos during the playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner." Fans yelled "Osama! Osama!" as the U.S. was eliminated by Mexico. The following year, in March 2005, Mexican soccer fans again cheered the al Qaeda mastermind&#39;s name at a World Cup qualifier. ESPN reported the audience again booed and whistled during the U.S. national anthem, and plastic bags filled with urine were reportedly tossed on American players. One Mexican fan told the Christian Science Monitor: "&#39;Every schoolboy knows about 1848. . . . When they robbed our territory,&#39; referring to when Texas, California and New Mexico were annexed to the U.S. as part of a peace treaty ending the war between the two countries, &#39;that was the beginning.&#39;" This bitterness is long-standing, deep-seated and stoked by top Mexican government officials and elites. But pointing this reality out in the context of our crucial national debate over sovereignty, immigration, assimilation, border security and the rule of law will get you labeled a bigot. Our leaders have concluded that it is better to pander, hide, pull out a friendly Spanish phrase like Minnillo did, and pray that the hatred will go away by giving the pro-amnesty lobby its legislative goodie-bag. Meanwhile, as Manhattan Institute fellow Heather Mac Donald points out, the White House continues to attack opponents of the Bush-Kennedy amnesty package as "nativists." Conservative columnist Linda Chavez accused amnesty critics of "not liking Mexicans." Department of suggested enforcement advocates wanted to "execute" illegal aliens. And Republican Sen. Lindsay Graham trashed immigration enforcement proponents as "bigots" in front of the ethnocentric, open-borders group La Raza. Next, they&#39;ll tell us the mob at the Miss Universe pageant was simply "doing the booing Americans won&#39;t do." speak out against the treatment Miss USA received in Mexico? Will any amnesty peddler in Washington? Imagine if Miss Mexico were booed, heckled and subjected to chants of "USA, USA" if the pageant had been held here. Smith can hold her head up high. Those who are selling out our country, on the other hand, should hang their heads in shame. Michelle Malkin is author of "Unhinged: Exposing Liberals Gone Wild."

Just as Judd Apatow's "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" had a surprisingly old-fashioned chastity message buried under all that raucous humor, "Knocked Up" dares to suggest that two people who accidentally make a baby should see it through together. It also derives laughs from men and women failing to understand each other, but the characters feel like real people, not like the cardboard joke-dispensers they could have been. It's the thinking man's R-rated sex comedy. It begins with this nightmare premise: What if a drunken one-night stand led to a pregnancy? Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a pretty E! Channel production assistant who's just been given a shot at on-air work. Her career is starting to take off. Foolishly, she hooked up one night with Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), who's average-looking and chubby, though he makes up for it by being funny. Ben and his several housemates, all in their mid-20s and going nowhere, have vague plans of launching a lucrative website that catalogs movie nudity for leering males. Specifics on how this site will operate or how it will make money have not yet been nailed down. Alison and Ben's liaison was a mistake, obviously, but the li'l fetus in Alison's tummy means they must continue to interact. An abortion is not an option, of course, as it would end the movie immediately, and (though this is a lesser factor) because Alison doesn't want one. Ben, a decent and honest guy underneath all the pot-smoking and general uselessness, says he'll be as involved with the pregnancy and child-rearing as Alison wants him to be. He accepts responsibility for his actions, though not before going through the usual stages of anger and disbelief. So Alison and Ben set out to get to know each other over the next eight months, to see if they could work as a couple, to determine how best to raise the child they've accidentally made. The comedy of two very different strangers being thrust together is abundant, and it would be sufficient for one movie. Heck, that's the premise of most romantic comedies: We're opposite, and we don't like each other, but we'll eventually fall in love. Apatow's brilliant twist is to include another couple: Alison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Debbie's husband Pete (Paul Rudd). Alison lives in Debbie and Pete's pool house and is witness to their dull, crabby marriage, which has now produced two little girls (both played by Apatow's real-life children; Leslie Mann is Apatow's wife). Once Ben enters the picture, he and Pete become buddies. Alison and Debbie commiserate about their relationship woes, eating ice cream and complaining; Ben and Pete crack jokes and drive to Las Vegas, where they watch Cirque du Soleil while high on mushrooms. You can hear the resentment in Debbie's voice when she asks why Ben and Pete don't just get in a time machine and go back and have sex with each other, instead of Ben having sex with Alison. "Who needs a time machine?" Pete says in a mock seductive voice while gazing at Ben. Ben holds up a glass of booze and replies, "This is my time machine." And that's the film's big joke in a nutshell: Men get along with each other so much better than they do with women, and even better than women get along with each other. Apatow perfectly captures the camaraderie of young men -- the idiotic bets (one of Ben's friends has been dared not to cut his hair or shave his beard for a year), the vulgar but good-natured ribbing, the revelry-as-therapy that men use to work through their problems. But for as male-centric as the movie could have been, it gives the women their due, too, making it one of the few battle-of-the-sexes comedies where both sides make good points. There are scenes dealing with Debbie's fears of getting older and becoming less attractive, her love for her husband that keeps getting caught up on her fear of losing him. Alison is young and has unlimited potential, and now she has a baby on the way that could ruin everything. She's scared, but she's strong. She needs a man to step up and be a true partner. She needs Ben to quit being a lazy, unemployed 25-year-old and DO something. The man-child-grows-up story is common these days, and so is the opposites-attract romantic comedy, and we've certainly seen our share of married-people-discover-marriage-is-sometimes-boring angst. But "Knocked Up" blends these familiar elements into something fresh and heartfelt, not to mention breathtakingly funny. It's over two hours long, which is highly unusual for a comedy, and while I can identify scenes that could have been cut, to do so would have been to lessen the film's impact. Most of the material surrounding Pete and Debbie's marriage could have been eliminated, and the movie would have been 95 minutes long. But it also would have been a forgettable, throwaway sex comedy instead of the multi-layered relationship story it is. Seth Rogen, from Apatow's TV shows "Freaks and Geeks" and "Undeclared," is perfectly cast as Ben. Ben is not handsome or ambitious, but with his good-natured sense of humor and unassuming demeanor, you can see why a girl would like him. By the same token, Katherine Heigl (of "Gray's Anatomy") demonstrates far more comedic agility than I'd have guessed she had in her, and makes Alison more than just the Pretty Blonde Who Gets Stuck with the Loser. At some point in the last few years, without anyone noticing, Paul Rudd somehow became one of the funniest men in America, and Leslie Mann's drunk driving scene in "40-Year-Old Virgin" is still one of that movie's highlights. They add a pleasantly tart flavor to "Knocked Up," ad-libbing and riffing as merrily as you please. Let us also mention Martin Starr, Jonah Hill, Jason Segel, and Jay Baruchel as Ben's housemates, all quick-witted and goofy and, at one point, stricken with pinkeye as the result of an ill-conceived flatulence prank. Numerous familiar faces -- Harold Ramis, Joanna Kerns, Tim Bagley, "SNL's" Bill Hader and Kristen Wiig, Loudon Wainwright, Alan Tudyk, Mo Collins, B.J. Novak, and Ken Jeong, to name several -- pop up for one or two scenes each, steal some laughs, then scurry off again. It's the kind of film where even if a character only has one line, chances are that one line is funny. "Knocked Up" has some of the year's funniest moments, some of them centered on hip pop-cultural knowledge (there are references to "Munich," Modest Yahoo, and "Murderball"), and most of them verbal rather than physical. A second viewing didn't yield quite as many laughs for me as the first one did -- though it's worth noting that even that second viewing was more enjoyable than 95 percent of all Hollywood comedies are on their first viewing. It's a near-perfect mix of juvenility and intelligence, and of coarseness and sweetness. Buy the Tickets Online for "Knocked Up" at Fandango now!

ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals Spector defense targets forensic errors By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent Article Launched: 05/31/2007 03:49:20 AM PDT Click photo to enlarge Defense attorney Christopher Plourd places his pen in his mouth to represent a gun entering a mouth, as he cross-examines Dr. Louis Pena, a deputy medical examiner, during the murder trial of music producer Phil Spector, Wednesday, May 30, 2007, at Los Angeles Superior Court in Los Angeles. Investigators made mistakes in evidence collection and handling in actress Lana Clarkson's shooting death, including the loss of a piece of one of her teeth, Pena conceded Wednesday. LOS ANGELES- A coroner testifying in Phil Spector's murder trial acknowledged there were crime lab mistakes in evidence collection and handling including moving Lana Clarkson's body, which ended up compromising evaluation of at least one item at the crime scene. Dr. Louis Pena also said Wednesday during cross-examination by Spector's defense attorneys that medical findings could not determine who held the gun that fired the bullet that killed the actress. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, on Feb. 3, 2003, after she agreed to accompany him to his mansion from her job as a hostess at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. The defense is seeking to show that Clarkson pulled the trigger of the handgun inserted in her mouth. "Let's get it very basic," defense attorney Christopher Plourd said Wednesday. "You can't tell who was holding the gun." "That's correct," Pena replied. Pena said Clarkson had gunshot residue on both of her hands and that he classified the case as "pending" until he finally signed off on it and entered a death certificate on Sept. 19, 2003. But the residue didn't necessarily mean she fired the gun, he said. "There are two ways to look at it," said Pena. "It implies the person could have been holding a weapon at the time of discharge or could be in the vicinity." On Tuesday, Pena was unequivocal that Clarkson's death was a homicide. He testified there was no evidence Clarkson had been putting her affairs in order in advance of a suicide, and he described the actress as a hopeful person with no history of depression or suicide attempts. He said she had a bruise on her tongue indicating a trauma, possibly from the gun being shoved in her mouth, and had recent bruises on her right arm and hand. He said Wednesday he didn't consider the tongue bruise significant until prosecutors raised the matter recently. The medical examiner also said criminalists made mistakes in evidence collection and handling, including the loss of a piece of one of Clarkson's teeth. The missing tooth fragment was among items in an in-house coroner's office memo about concerns in the case. The memo also said a criminalist used lift-off tape on Clarkson's dress to collect samples of evidence and inadvertently compromised investigators' ability to evaluate blood spatter on the dress. Pena acknowledged during cross-examination that Clarkson's body was mistakenly moved, causing blood to flow from her mouth, compromising evaluation of her dress for blood spatter. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s with what became known as the "Wall of Sound" recording technique that changed pop music. Clarkson was best known for her role in Roger Corman's 1985 cult film "Barbarian Queen." The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

Jamison Stone, 11, claimed he shot and killed a massive wild pig that weighed more than 1,000 pounds earlier this month. He said the animal measured more than 9 feet from tail to snout. Jamison said he bagged the boar on a hunting preserve in eastern Alabama. However, the animal's size had some wondering if the whole thing was tall tale, despite pictures provided by his father. Now he has the swine's skull and some backup from a taxidermist. "Jerry (Cunningham), the taxidermist, brought me this bleached skull of my hog and this is a 1,051-pound hog skull and that's a ... 250-pound hog skull," the boy said, pointing to the skull of a smaller animal, placed next to his monster's hog for comparison. Cunningham agreed with Jamison on the size of the boar. "I actually skinned this pig out," Cunningham said. "And I know it was a 1,000-pound hog. It was that big. No doubt."

Paula Abdul is the latest celebrity to slate the young Hollywood stars, but in a thinly veiled way which will no doubt save her the scathing defensive words from Lohan and the rest. Speaking to OK! Magazine, the American Idol judge says: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." If anyone needed a role model, I think we may have just found the woman! Abdul goes on to tell about how she suffers from reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God. I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years." Not pleasant by anyone's standards. And in case you were wondering why she sometimes looks groggy while on American Idol? "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am! I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain." Young Hollywood don't realise how easy they have it... There are no reader comments.

In a rare public spat between the two Hollywood studios, Sony has accused Disney of including a seventh day of takings in figures purporting to show unprecedented six-day takings of $401m (&#163;202m) for the third part of the series, At World's End. Previews in several countries were rolled in to the total, though Disney said this did not amount to many filmgoers. Sony said that including a seventh day, its recent hit Spiderman 3 grossed $418m.

BROBEN / USA Network Debra Messing is the wife, Peter Jacobson the showbiz-exec husband. Surrounded by a high-toned, lighthearted production, Debra Messing ( ) breezes back to TV tonight at 9 in the USA cable mini-series As much fun as a cosmo at Skybar on the Sunset Strip, it&#0039;s a satire of hollow Hollywood, where executives elbow incessantly for power and money while their wives engage in glorious artifice to make it all look so easy. But is also a just-ducky study in pluck. Messing plays Molly Kagan, left in the lurch by her showbiz-executive husband, who phones in the news from the Peninsula Hotel. Hightailing it from their luscious Brentwood abode to hubby&#0039;s suite at Beverly Hills&#0039; swankiest joint, she challenges him incredulously: "I work 24/7, making sure that Kenny Kagan never has to remember or do anything that he doesn&#0039;t want to do. I do it all with perfect hair. . . . I&#0039;m fired?" Yup. And she doesn&#0039;t take it well. "Somebody&#0039;s cranky," says her decorator, friend and confidant, Rodney. "Of course I&#0039;m cranky," she snaps. "I haven&#0039;t eaten for 12 years." The show, which starts with a two-hour send-off tonight and follows with four, one-hour installments on Thursdays through June, is based on Gigi Levangie Grazer&#0039;s novel of the same name. Grazer, wife of mogul Brian Grazer ( and a million movies including The Da Vinci Code ), is considerably more successful and accomplished than the typical Hollywood wife, and it&#0039;s likely that if Brian dumped her, she&#0039;d still get prime seats in the hottest restaurants and keep her club memberships, if she cared about such things. But Molly gets snubbed and booted. We normal folks, fishing around behind the cushions for enough change to cover two Happy Meals for the kids, aren&#0039;t likely to care about that. Messing, however, imbues the character with likability, and Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon&#0039;s script (they wrote for Julia Roberts) leavens the cynicism of Grazer&#0039;s best-seller. Jon Avnet, who would need a whole room to show off all his awards from Broadway, TV and the movies, directs. He did , among lots of others. This crowd of big-timers knows how to treat the ladies. femmes include double Emmy winner and double Oscar nominee Judy Davis, who&#0039;s convulsively funny as Molly&#0039;s older BFF, Joan; and Tony winner Anika Noni Rose, the guard at the Malibu Colony (where, in real life, the Grazers have a $16 million shack and neighbors who include Tom Hanks and Jim Carrey). She becomes one of lonely Molly&#0039;s few new friends when our jilted jewel winds up in Joan&#0039;s house on the beach because the owner&#0039;s spending the summer in France. Only it&#0039;s not France. It&#0039;s the Charity Harbor rehab center, where Joan finds herself trapped until she can deal with childhood "issues" that the therapist knows have driven her into Martiniland - very dry, up, with olives. Since she&#0039;s quite contented there and would like to return and since there are no issues, Judy/Joan creates them in a comic tour de force. There are a handsome stranger and a Russian nanny and an adorable child, and it&#0039;s all played with -style pizzicato strings in the background to make sure you take nothing too seriously, as if you ever could. It&#0039;s hard to imagine better warm-weather fun. Too bad just-fired NBC boss Kevin Reilly couldn&#0039;t wangle the show away from sister network USA and run it on the big network last month, when NBC was getting such abysmal ratings. Instead of queuing up like Molly, Reilly, one of the least cutthroat network toppers in the last few years, might still be getting a good table at Morton&#0039;s. a six-hour mini-series, debuts at 9 tonight on USA.

Paula Abdul says she didn't figure out her purpose in life until she became a judge on Fox network's "American Idol." NEW YORK- Paula Abdul says she didn't figure out her purpose in life until she became a judge on Fox network's "American Idol." "I knew since I was a little girl that I had this profound way of touching people. My purpose is bringing out everybody's best and being that cheerleader to other people's success," the 44-year-old singer-dancer tells OK! magazine in its latest issue. "Being a judge on 'American Idol' overshadows being a Grammy Award winner and selling millions of records," she says. Abdul has been diagnosed with reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), a chronic neurological disorder that causes severe pain. "I have four titanium plates in my neck. I've had 14 surgeries over the years. I had an operation the same evening as the first season finale of 'American Idol,'" she says. "It can come and go at any time, but I no longer have the intense nerve pain that is associated with RSD, thank God." Abdul&mdash;who says she was hit by a drunk driver in 1987 and injured in an emergency plane landing in the early '90s&mdash;says she is treated with anti-inflammatory medications and has massage and acupuncture treatments for her pain. "If I appear exhausted on television, it's because I am!" she says. "I have a lot of sleepless nights because I'm in so much pain. I was taking far more medication on earlier seasons (of 'American Idol'), and nobody said anything. I try to say something and I stumble, and that's what people have picked up on. I'm not polished." When asked how she responds to claims that her behavior during "Idol" is sometimes bizarre, Abdul replies: "I'm sick of it. I've never been drunk. I don't do recreational drugs. It's defamation of character." The choreographer and former Laker girl also says: "I'm a warrior. I'm not the best dancer, and I'm certainly not the best singer, but I am an entire package of a great performer." Fox is a unit of News Corp.

Reilly's partner told The New York Times that he died Friday in Los Angeles of complications from pneumonia. Reilly was 76. Reilly won a Tony Award in 1962 for playing Bud Frump in the original Broadway production of "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying." He gained fame by becoming what he described as a "game show fixture." He was a regular on programs such as "Match Game" and "Hollywood Squares," often wearing giant glasses and colorful suits with ascots. Reilly's larger-than-life persona and affinity for double-entendres also landed him on the "Tonight Show" with Johnny Carson more than 95 times. . All rights reserved.

That image shouted from the cover of tabloid newspapers on Monday as if to herald the umpteenth public wipeout for the 20-year-old actress, who was arrested here Saturday for driving under the influence after she crashed her Mercedes into a tree along the residential strip of Sunset Boulevard. On Monday she checked into a Malibu rehabilitation facility called Promises. And quick as a shot (no, not that kind), all of Hollywood was a-clatter with the sound of clucking tongues over advice not taken. So sad, everyone said, such a waste: so pretty, so talented  so uninsurable. Like too, the spectacle of a young womans self-destruction seemed to demand expressions of sympathy along with the requisite scorn. But hard reality was also quickly setting in. Across this close-knit town, decision makers were mentally wiping Ms. Lohan from their short lists. One studio chief who has worked with Ms. Lohan said that he would not hire her until she proved herself healthy and reliable. (Confident at least of this possibility, he would only comment anonymously.) My hope for her would be that her growing pains get sorted out, said Valerie Van Galder, president for marketing for Columbia Tristar. The wild child used to be a phase you grew out of. This feels different. I think now theres more attention to minutiae, and youre stalked everywhere you go. To be hired again, some said, Ms. Lohan might have to be more than sober. She would need perhaps to post her salary as bond, or pay for her own insurance, even on an independent film. Ms. Lohan was meant to start a new movie this week, an independent production titled about two female con artists, also starring . The films producers met on Wednesday to decide whether to replace Ms. Lohan or hold off while she spent a month under wraps. Many could say they saw this coming. Ms. Lohan has already worn out her welcome at Disney, where she made four films, including the hits Parent Trap, when she was a precocious 11-year-old, and in 2003, in which she played a thoroughly credible middle-aged mom. But by the time she starred in in 2005, she was already a paparazzi fixture, and Disney was worried enough to sit her down for a talking-to. I told her before the movie began, This is the moment in your career where you either become , recalled Nina Jacobson, who ran the studio at the time and is now a producer at DreamWorks. And while filming went fine, Ms. Lohan went missing during the international press junket in Europe. The image issue aside, professionalism-wise we were disappointed, Ms. Jacobson said. And I was sad, because shes so charismatic and appealing on screen. Its a very sad thing to see it go to waste this way. Those in Ms. Lohans camp find all this hand wringing to be disingenuous. One person close to Ms. Lohan pointed out that Disney handed the actress a $1 million bonus check for Freaky Friday, an invitation for her , then a 16-year-old, to indulge irresponsible impulses. And James G. Robinson, a producer of Georgia Rule who had a letter sent to Ms. Lohan at her Chateau Marmont hotel room last year calling her a spoiled child for failing to show up for her scheduled call times (the letter was conveniently leaked to the news media even as it was delivered), later invited the actress to be his date to a At Sony the hope was that Ms. Lohan would right herself, and soon. The studio has a thriller starring Ms. Lohan, I Know Who Killed Me, out in late July. Ms. Lohans publicist, Leslie Sloane-Zelnick, said her client intended to do the publicity for the film, but admitted that things were in limbo. She will work for that film, she wants to work for that film, Ms. Sloane-Zelnick said. But were waiting on her situation, in general. At the end of the day, her talent will prevail. Someone will take a chance on her. Next Article in Movies (1 of 35) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Writer and director Judd Apatow's follow-up to 2005's funniest movie, , re-teams many of the actors he used in as well as other projects he's had a hand in over the past decade. The result is similar to hearing a well-honed jazz band in which all the players can anticipate the turns in the road and react appropriately because they've shared those bends before. "When you find someone who's very funny and you're in sync with, you just tend to want to work with them again," Mr. Apatow, 39, said by phone last week. That acquisition of talent began during his days writing and producing the acclaimed television show , which featured a teenage Seth Rogen. Mr. Apatow nurtured his young star's career with supporting roles in Anchor Man: The Legend of Ron Burgundy , which he produced, and before casting him in as the lazy Ben, who impregnates Katherine Heigl's Alison during a drunken one-night stand. And Mr. Apatow didn't forget Mr. Rogen's friends, many of whom also starred in and another of Mr. Apatow's television shows, . The result is a familiarity you can't rehearse. "I knew that if I hired all of Seth's real best friends that they would have this funny chemistry, because I've seen what they're like when they hang out together. And they always made me laugh," Mr. Apatow says. "It's actually kind of a lazy thing for a writer to do &#8211; I'll just get all these real people to play themselves. I didn't even bother to change their names &#8211; Jonah Hill plays Jonah; Jason Segel plays Jason. But you do get a shorthand with people. It's not like I was trying to avoid strangers or anything." Much of Mr. Apatow's success can be attributed to his careful casting. When he gets an idea for a project, one of the first things he does is make calls to the actors he'd like. Armed with the knowledge of who will deliver the lines he's writing, he says he is better able to tailor the parts to the person. Part of that process is picking the actors' brains. While writing , the director phoned Paul Rudd, whom he previously worked with on , to ask about his experiences expecting his first child. Mr. Apatow says he meticulously read books available for parents-to-be and was surprised to learn that Mr. Rudd read nary a page. The reason? He told Mr. Apatow if he had read the books, the frightening experience he was about to have would become real. Mr. Rudd's character is married with kids to Alison's sister (played by vet and Mr. Apatow's wife, Leslie Mann), but his story went on to inform Ben's outlook on preparing for the baby. "I'm just kind of looking for little truths that are funny that the audience recognizes in themselves," Mr. Apatow says. With cast set and script written, it's time to shoot. And it's also the time when all of this familiarity pays its biggest dividends. Many of the biggest laughs come from jokes that never appear on the written page and are the result of that ad-libbed comedic interplay that only comes through time. "I think you have a shorthand when it comes to improvising scenes. We know each other's senses of humor and we just know the other person," Mr. Rudd said at March's South by Southwest Film Festival, a day after screened to a howling crowd at the Paramount Theatre. "There's stuff in , like with Seth and I, when Seth comes to the birthday party and we have an exchange where we try and top each other with insults. We did a long run of those, and that came about I would imagine from that whole 'You know how I know you're gay?' game. That whole scene was just sort of improvised on the spot in "I kinda know if I yell out a line to Paul, I generally know how he'll do it," Mr. Apatow says. (Mr. Rudd admits that one of the best one-liners in the movie is one Mr. Apatow yelled out during the middle of filming a scene. When the production was delayed 10 minutes so everyone could finish laughing, it found its way into the film.)

Griffin offers explanation for Rosie departure BY: Actress Archives | Monday, May 28, 2007 Kathy Griffin, a close friend of , has come forward to reveal why the host of The View has officially left the show and won't be completing the final three weeks of her contract. Yes, it does have to do with 's on-screen fight with , but that's only half the story. According to Kathy Griffin, as reported by People magazine, her friend was furious that the producers of The View decided to turn her honest disagreement with into something sensational by split-screening the two hosts of The View during their fight. Kathy Griffin tells the magazine that she spoke to right after the announcement from ABC Television that she wouldn't be returning to The View, " I said, 'What was it really?' 'The split-screen. I don't want to do "Hannity and Colmes."' Kathy Griffin has filled in twice for in the past few weeks and spoke about the departure of her friend to a sold out crowd at the Borgata Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City. According to TMZ, Kathy Griffin also claimed that doesn't even feel that much hatred for heard that Donald Trump had called "stupid," she apparently expressed sadness. According to Kathy Griffin, " She doesn't even hate Elisabeth. It all started on Wednesday when , two hosts of The View who have never seen eye to eye, got into their most protracted and intense fight in the history of the show in front of the world. The fight was started because of the differing opinions of the war in Iraq between , but the two very different hosts have feuded really since Rosie got to the program. It got ugly on Wednesday's edition of The View, when expressed the opinion that " the enemy is in Iraq. then jumped into the fray as she pointed out, " You just said our enemy is in Iraq...Did Iraq attack us? " As the heated exchange went on, The View producers split the screen with one side focusing on and the other zoomed in on , who is married to New York Giants back-up quarterback Tim Hasselbeck and is the sister-in-law of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Matt Hasselbeck, used a football analogy to explain her point of view. " If you're playing a game and I say I'm throwing to my receiver wide right, okay what does that do for your enemy Rosie? " Rosie shot back, " Well Elisabeth, if the enemy are innocent civilians, I don't want to play that kind of football. It got worse from there with Joy Behar trying to settle down and the controversial host clearly becoming exasperated with the whole situation. Referring to how much time she had left on the program, That's why I'm not going to right with you anymore because it's absurd, so for three weeks you can say all the Republican crap you want. It wasn't over, even as Sherri Shepherd tried to cut to commercial and Joy Behar tried to calm , who shouted out, " I asked you if you believe what the Republican pundits were saying. You said nothing and that was cowardly. wasn't happy at all with that, saying, " Dont call me a coward. I sit here every day and open my heart and tell people exactly what I believe...It was not cowardly. It was honest...asking a rhetorical question? That is cowardly. I need a drink of water, lets go to commercial. The View needs hosts. With gone for good and about to go on maternity leave, the program, which is more popular than ever, is going to have to find interesting characters to replace them. As of right now, Joy Behar is the only person officially coming back to The View. was only on The View for less than a year, but it helped the show by getting it all kinds of new press from the host's high profile fights with Donald Trump and to her comments on the Catholic Church and the attacks of 9/11. Whatever people think of , she will be tough to replace on The View. Elisabeth Hasselbeck in the News Are Rosie and Hasselbeck speaking again?

"Its shocking you know," admits actor Johnny Depp, "I'm still sort of amazed that so many people in so many corners of the globe embraced the films and Captain Jack Sparrow. Nothing like this has ever happened to me, but what's happened with Pirates... hasn't happened to many people. It's very, very moving and emotional. Seeing little kids dressed up as the character, talking like him. Itâs just amazing." Depp reacted to the success as Walt Disney Pictures' epic adventure Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End , from Jerry Bruckheimer Films, landed in the global box office record books and laid claim to the biggest opening in industry history with $401 million in its first six days of its release. In the aftermath of Dead Man's Chest, the trilogy now holds out the big Pirate struggle. The flick unfolds the fury of the oceans as Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) get allied with Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) in a desperate quest to free Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) from his mind bending trap in Davy Jones's locker. While the terrifying ghost ship, , and Davy Jones, under the control of the East India Trading Company, wreaks havoc across the Seven Seas. Navigating through treachery, betrayal and wild waters, they must forge their way to Singapore and confront the cunning Chinese Pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat ). Now headed beyond the very ends of the earth, each must ultimately choose a side in a final, titanic battle, as not only their lives and fortunes, but the entire future of the freedom-loving Pirate way, hangs in the balance.

He was 76. Reilly died Friday in Los Angeles of complications from pneumonia, his partner, Patrick Hughes, told the New York Times. Reilly began his career in New York City, taking acting classes at a studio with Steve McQueen, Geraldine Page and Hal Holbrook. In 1962, he appeared on Broadway as Bud Frump in the original Broadway production of ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying.'' The role won Reilly a Tony Award. He was nominated for a Tony again for playing Cornelius in ''Hello, Dolly!'' In 1997 he received another nomination for directing Julie Harris and Charles Durning in a revival of ''The Gin Game.'' After moving to Hollywood in 1960s he appeared as the nervous Claymore Gregg on TV's ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir'' and as a featured guest on ''The Dean Martin Show.'' He gained fame by becoming what he described as a ''game show fixture'' in the 1970s and 80s. He was a regular on programs like ''Match Game'' and ''Hollywood Squares,'' often wearing giant glasses and colorful suits with ascots. His larger-than-life persona and affinity for double-entendres also landed him on the ''Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson more than 95 times. Reilly ruefully admitted his wild game show appearances adversely affected his acting career. ''You can't do anything else once you do game shows,'' he told The Advocate, the national gay magazine, in 2001. ''You have no career.'' His final work was an autobiographical one-man show, ''Save It for the Stage: The Life of Reilly,'' about his family life growing up in the Bronx. The title grew out of the fact that when he would act out as a child, his mother would often admonish him to ''save it for the stage.'' The stage show was made into the 2006 feature film called ''The Life of Reilly.'' Reilly's openly gay television persona was ahead of its time, and sometimes stood in his way. He recalled a network executive telling him ''they don't let queers on television.'' Hughes, his only immediate survivor, said Reilly had been ill for more than a year. No memorial plans had been announced. Copyright 2007 Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed.

May. 31 2007 8:12 AM ET -- A pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" was auctioned for US$192,000 - more than six times its estimated value.

The auction house said it had expected the dress to sell for up to $30,000. "The sale was filled with iconic pieces," said Helen Hall, Christie's head of entertainment memorabilia. "It captured people's imagination." Hall said the auction house was pleased with the results of the sale, which brought in $1.2 million. Other items on the block included Marilyn Monroe's script for "Something's Got To Give," with the actress' handwritten notes, which sold for $19,200. A program from President John F. Kennedy's birthday celebration that featured the actress at Madison Square Garden went for $66,000. All the prices include the Christie's commission.

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi%3Ff%3D/n/a/2007/05/30/entertainment/e130559D57.DTL&cid Film Review: `Mr. Brooks' a Serial Mess Film Review: `Mr. Brooks' a Serial Mess By DAVID GERMAIN, AP Movie Writer Wednesday, May 30, 2007 (05-30) 13:05 PDT , (AP) -- Dressed up as a glossy Hollywood production professing to present Kevin Costner in a whole new unheroic light, "Mr. Brooks" actually is a sloppy, sleazy trifle of chaotic storytelling about a community leader who moonlights as a serial killer. There's a bit of hope for "Mr. Brooks" early on as Costner's title character engages in wicked interplay with his illusory alter-ego (William Hurt), a giddily bloodthirsty phantom who eggs on his counterpart to commit the dirtiest of deeds. Director Bruce A. Evans and writing partner Raynold Gideon quickly begin piling on more and sillier plot threads, suffocating the story with a jumble of forced connections and coincidences among the characters. The movie opens with a testimonial dinner for local man of the year Earl Brooks (Costner), a civic booster and seemingly pleasant but boring owner of a company that makes boxes. Perfect cover for a mass murderer. On the drive home with his impossibly adoring wife (Marg Helgenberger, showing no traces of her "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" sass), Earl gets a visit from his personal bogey man Marshall (Hurt), who pops up in the backseat to urge his buddy to resume the killing spree he abandoned two years ago. You see, Earl's been going to AA meetings, proclaiming himself an addict, though conveniently withholding the fact that he's addicted to murder. He wants to leave behind the serial-slayer life so badly, or so he says, but it takes just the briefest arm-twisting by Marshall before Earl carries out a fresh, immaculately plotted double murder. He leaves behind his trademark, bloody thumbprints of both victims, adding new stress to the life of detective Tracy Atwood (Demi Moore), a cop juggling such huge personal crises that the return of the notorious "Thumbprint Killer" should almost be a diversion. Earl uncharacteristically leaves a loose end in Mr. Smith (Dane Cook), a witness who blackmails the killer with a bizarre request. Meantime, Earl's daughter (Danielle Panabaker) comes home from college harboring dark secrets of her own, while Tracy is dealing with the threat of an escaped psychopath on her trail and a gold-digging husband suing her for divorce. All this baggage gradually collides in a pure train wreck of outlandishness, the movie dragging on far too long and substituting garish twists in place of the slightest insight into what makes a serial killer tick. This is just Evans' second time as director, coming 15 years after the forgettable crime caper "Kuffs," which he also wrote with Gideon. As screenwriters, the pair teamed on a modern classic, the Stephen King adaptation "Stand By Me," but "Mr. Brooks" has none of that finesse. The actors seem to aim for drollness that would have served well as a sadistically comic underpinning in a film that made any sense. Instead, they just come off as dull, with the exception of Hurt &#8212; who, playing a figment of the mind, gets to mug and cackle with glee. When your best character is a serial killer's imaginary friend, you know your movie's in trouble. "Mr. Brooks," an MGM release, is rated R for strong bloody violence, some graphic sexual content, nudity and language. Running time: 120 minutes. One and a half stars out of four. Motion Picture Association of America rating definitions: G &#8212; General audiences. All ages admitted. PG &#8212; Parental guidance suggested. Some material may not be suitable for children.

Film producers seek to accommodate Lohan`s rehab Los Angeles, May 31: Producers of Lindsay Lohan's next movie said on Wednesday they would accommodate the young actress by rearranging their shooting schedule to film her part once she completes her latest stint in rehab. Lohan's participation in the movie, "Poor Things," starring and produced by Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine, was thrown into question when Lohan checked into a residential treatment facility in Malibu following a weekend drunken-driving arrest. But MacLaine and her fellow producer on the film, Rob Hickman, issued a statement expressing support for the 20-year-old actress. "In the spirit of helping Lindsay Lohan and her rehabilitation, we have been asked by Lindsay to comply with her wishes to continue working on 'Poor Things,'" they said. "We are trying to rearrange the shooting schedule to facilitate her working at the end of the shoot to coincide with the completion of her rehabilitation. We wish her love and the blending of mind, body and spirit." Lohan's latest woes mark the second time in a year that her personal behavior has put her at odds with the demands of her film career. Last July another producer, Morgan Creek Prods. executive James Robinson, went public with a letter to Lohan scolding her for repeatedly showing up late on the set of "Georgia Rule," which is currently in theaters. In his unusual rebuke, Robinson called her behavior "discourteous, irresponsible and unprofessional" and cited her "ongoing all-night heavy partying" as the reason for her tardiness. Lohan returned to work the next day, and "Georgia Rule," which paired her with another Oscar-winning film legend, Jane Fonda, was released earlier this month. Entertainment trade paper Daily Variety reported that shooting on her latest film, the dark comedy "Poor Things," originally was set to begin this week in Los Angeles. Co-starring Olympia Dukakis and Rosario Dawson, the film was inspired by the recent real-life cases of elderly con-artist women convicted of scams involving homeless men, insurance fraud and murder. Lohan was booked on suspicion of driving under the influence in Beverly Hills after running her Mercedes over a curb and into a hedge early on Saturday. Police said they also found a substance in the car they believe to be cocaine. *Your friend's e-mail address: Would you believe Kevin Costner as serial killer?

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/8-3&fd=R&url=http://www.zap2it.com/tv/news/zap-story-thestarterwife,0,3972741.story%3Fcoll%3Dzap-tv-mainheadline&cid=1116730139&ei=jv1eRsO-FY-oqgO5vv3PDQ Divorce, Hollywood Style - Zap2it Most E-mailed Stories &raquo; By Jacqueline Cutler, Zap2it Debra Messing, 'The Starter Wife' The term "starter wife" is offensive enough to make it sound like a little kit to grow a spouse. Like a starter house that needs work, or a starter hobby kit with the bare essentials, this has the ugly ring of planned obsolescence. Yet it is quite real. "The Starter Wife," USA Network's miniseries launching May 31 and continuing Thursdays until June 28, is based on Gigi Levangie Grazer's best-seller. On a whim and because he's having an affair with a pop tart (in the book, it's Britney Spears), Hollywood studio chief Kenny (Peter Jacobson, "As Good as It Gets") dumps Molly (Debra Messing, "Will & Grace") via cell phone. Forced to fend for herself, Molly comes into her own. She had written a children's book years ago, but during her marriage, she worked at being a Hollywood wife. Now she must find her way in the wake of divorce. Kenny is such a cliched pig, he's fun to hate. We first glimpse him on the treadmill while he watches TV on several screens. He calls Molly, sleeping in another part of the house, to tell her a dog relieved itself on their property. She calls the housekeeper to clean up. Molly makes the calls that keep their complicated and superficial life running. That's what these women do; they manage their lives. They hire the nannies to tend to their children and the maids to clean their homes. As the women keep themselves starved and toned, waxed and dyed, the men make scads of money that maintain oversized mansions, SUVs and egos. This is a world in which children's birthday parties are catered (though the women do not eat), and circus clowns perform. Molly and Kenny have a 5-year-old daughter, Jaden, but she isn't much of an issue, as the sitter watches her. "Approaching this, I thought, 'How am I going to key into this woman?'" Messing says. "And the first thing I started with was sort of the parallel between being a starter wife and being a high-profile actress. The expectations, there are rules: That your hair be shiny and your eyebrows be arched and clean and that your nails be manicured, and if you show up at an event and you are not groomed, it is a sign of disrespect. It is considered part of your job to do that. "And that covers the weight image and the yoga and what the actresses in that community do in order to try to be able to get in. And it is all about fitting in and who is going to be invited to the party, so to speak." There's a wonderful scene early on where Molly steps on the scale, sees a number most women haven't glimpsed since high school and says, "I wonder how much an appendix weighs." Fans of the book will notice changes. The most basic is that the heroine of the book is named Gracie, but since Messing is famous for playing another Grace, the character needed a new name. Another is that Sam, the homeless guy with whom Molly falls in love, is old enough to have gray streaking his hair and a real past. In the movie, Sam -- played by 35-year-old Stephen Moyer ("Quills") -- is younger and looks terrific in swim trunks. Molly, convinced she would never date again, winds up interested in two men, Sam and Lou (Joe Mantegna), who is Kenny's boss. Lou is a rarity; he's a studio boss who is humane. Messing and director Jon Avnet ("Fried Green Tomatoes") allude to a major change in the ending. The first four of the six hours available for review hew close to the book's plot. The only other sticking point is that a face cream company sponsors the miniseries, and it is worked into the movie. Certainly, Molly would apply under-eye cream, but this stinks of obvious product placement. "I have never shot a commercial in my life. I tried to do it tastefully and with a wink," Avnet says. The miniseries, however, remains sheer fun as great actors take digs at a world they know well. Messing infuses her character with the disbelief, vulnerability and finally gumption that a woman left after 10 years of marriage would feel. And it's critical that women beyond Los Angeles' gated communities relate to these characters, or this becomes too insular. Judy Davis, who plays Molly's friend, the caustic, sharp and alcoholic Joan, says, "There are a lot of Joans around." Joan, like Molly, once had a career; she was a lawyer. "She seemed to me a woman who had opted out a bit, married a wealthy older man, not really part of the Hollywood scene, certainly not part of the legal scene any more," Davis says from her home in Australia. "Joan, her journey in the story, her realization that she does have something to offer and she has to stay in there and participate in a responsible way, I guess is her line." When Davis wasn't shooting, she was able to hop a 45-minute flight home, as this filmed in Australia, to Mantegna's delight. "I'll say it was fun," he says. "It was on the gold coast of Australia during their summer. It was one of those times you look around and go, 'It's good to be the king.' In this profession, I have been very blessed in that it has taken me and my family all over the world." Mantegna and Avnet each mention they are married 31 years and are on their starter wives, quickly adding that these are their finisher wives as well. Despite the series' chick-lit, chick-flick look, Mantegna says, "I think it can attract men. It's like one of those guilty kind of pleasures. In the past I have read Jackie Collins books or Sidney Sheldon books, like in the summer when you go to the beach and say, 'What can I read that will not tax my mind that much?' It's a nice, pretty world, and the people are pretty and happy. It's a guilty summer pleasure. The men are very well represented." Avnet hopes people are "ridiculously entertained" by the movie, acknowledging, "It is, by nature, fluffy material. It makes fun of a lot of things -- mostly my world. I want them to see an identifiable woman and how she starts over and regroups and makes bad choices and makes good choices, and does it in a way that is incredibly identifiable and very, very satisfying."

Skip ads and navigation Last updated May 31, 2007 8:52 a.m. PT Harry Potter theme park headed to Fla. Hogwarts Castle - "The Wizarding World of Harry Potter" will be anchored by the most recognizable landmark in Harry Potter's world: Hogwarts castle. Fans will get the chance to experience some of their favorite locations both within Hogwarts and around the castle grounds when the new land opens at Universal's Islands of Adventure theme park. Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. and Universal Orlando Resort are partnering to create the world's first fully immersive Harry Potter themed environment based on J.K. Rowling's books and the Warner Bros. films. Opening in 2009, "The Wizarding World of Harry Potter" will feature rides and attractions, as well as shops and restaurants that will enable guests to sample fare from the wizarding world's best known establishments.

(PRNewsFoto/Universal Orlando Resort) LONDON -- Universal Studios is opening up a Harry Potter theme park in Florida - complete with the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Forbidden Forest and Hogsmeade village. "The Wizarding World of Harry Potter," will open in late 2009 in Orlando, officials said Thursday. "The plans I've seen look incredibly exciting, and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed," said author J.K. Rowling, who has been working with a creative team to make sure the park resembles the books and films. More than a dozen artists and designers lead by Stuart Craig, the production designer of the movies, have set up house in the studio where the movies are being filmed to make sure every detail is considered, according to Scott Trowbridge of Universal. "We're really going to the people who know this world best to ensure that level of authenticity," he said. The Potter park will allow visitors to view the iconic locations in Rowling's magical world, like Dumbledore's office in Hogwarts and the shops in Hogsmeade. Some locations may be in upcoming books, Trowbridge said. Trowbridge said while there would not be any character lookalikes at the park, fans wanting to see Harry Potter and his magical friends wouldn't leave disappointed. "This is Harry's world," said Trowbridge. "Most every fan wants to have an encounter with the star of the show." The Harry Potter book series has been translated into 65 languages with more than 325 million copies sold in over 200 territories around the world. The fifth film in the series, "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," will be released in theatres on 13 July. The seventh and final book of the series will be released on 21 July.

Lindsay Lohan suffers from multiple addictions, including alcohol and the painkiller OxyContin, her father, Michael Lohan, told E! Online Wednesday. (AP Photo/ Dick Yarwood,pool) By SANDY COHEN AP Entertainment Writer LOS ANGELES May 31, 2007 (AP) Lindsay Lohan's estranged father says she suffers from multiple addictions, including alcohol and the painkiller OxyContin, the Web site E! Online reported Wednesday. The 20-year-old actress checked into rehab Monday following a weekend that included crashing her Mercedes, being arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence and being photographed slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car. This is her second rehab stint this year. Broken Promises: Lohan's Rehab Redux PHOTOS: Lindsay Lohan Alleged DUI Crash Promises: The Ritz of Rehab Lindsay Lohan Booked on Suspicion of DUI New Beau Best Fit for Recovering Lohan? Police Bust Lohan, Find Possible Cocaine Film producers seek to accommodate Lohan's rehab "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay, because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care," Michael Lohan told E! Online. "And I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things. That's a very important step." Lindsay Lohan's publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, did not immediately return an after-hours call and e-mail from The Associated Press on Wednesday. Michael Lohan was released from a New York state prison in March after serving almost two years for driving while intoxicated and other charges. He said he is studying to become a drug-rehab counselor with the faith-based organization Teen Challenge. Before entering rehab, the actress was scheduled to start work this week on "Poor Things," a comedy featuring Shirley MacLaine, who is also a producer on the movie. MacLaine and co-producer Rob Hickman said in a statement Wednesday that Lohan still wants to work on the project. "We are trying to rearrange the shooting schedule to facilitate her working at the end of the shoot to coincide with the completion of her rehabilitation," the statement said. In other events swirling around Lohan, who turns 21 on July 2, authorities who have been conducting undercover operations at trendy celebrity watering holes in recent weeks are seeking to find out if she was served alcohol before her weekend car crash. California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control investigators also want to know if Lohan or others were served after hours, agency spokesman John Carr said.

Here's Your Tuesday Top Five: 5) Stanford Squatter Evicted How far would you go to become a Stanford student? Probably not as far as Azia Kim. The 18-year-old from Orange County, California, successfully pretended to be a member of the Cardinal student body for two semesters, "living in the dorms, buying textbooks and 'studying' for exams." Her friends from school say they aren't sure why she pulled such an elaborate con, "but many speculate that she felt pressure from overbearing parents to attend Stanford -- regardless of whether ." It is unclear whether she plans on using the experience to spruce up her admissions essay when and if she re-applies to Stanford, but I'd like to read that essay. 4) Real Estate Assets In what may be the most eye-catching wrongful termination since... well ever, a German real estate agent has been fired because of her desire to have the largest breasts in Europe. Annina Ulrich admits that since childhood she has been obsessed with enhancing her assets, but claims her boss did not understand that. According to the buxom 29-year-old her boss told her that "breast implants were not an asset and were damaging the company's image," even though customers apparently thought they were "great." Since being laid off, Ulrich has announced plans to open her own real estate agency complete with pictures of the 42-H breasts "on Marvel takes on Washington (AP) 3) Advertising Tail Spin In the latest guerrilla marketing tactic to run afoul of the law, 20th Century Fox, in collusion with The Franklin Mint, altered 40,000 U.S. quarters replacing the backside with an action shot of The Silver Surfer (see image), to hype their upcoming film "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer."

The centuries old tradition attracted participants from around the world, many of whom sustained injuries while in pursuit of a 7-8 pound Double Gloucester. According to three-time champion Jason Crowther, of West Wales, "[i]t was a bit slippery and I heard something crack, which I think was my knee ." Winners take home the wheel of cheese they were chasing, with $20 and $10 going to second and third place respectively. Softer conditions may have been responsible for the low number of serious injuries this year, with volunteer EMTs treating only 20 wounded chasers, compared to 34 last year. eBay Steal of the Week : For those of you in the market for a car with a really great story eBay is offering the actual hearse that carried President John F.

"Whether "In God We Trust" is an advertising vehicle for Christianity is anyone's call." I find it interesting that you needed to add that. It is also interesting that you feel the need to take a direct slam against Christianity. Then again, maybe you are not aware that Muslims, Buddhists, Hebrews, ... well just about all religions worship "God". You need to be a little more careful. Either your bias or your stupidity is showing. Posted by: SoMD | May 29, 2007 08:47 AM To be fair, Muslims believe in Allah, Jews believe in Yahwe and Buddists believe in Zen, and Hindus believe in a whole managery of different dieties. Only Chistians believe in God by the name God.

Posted by: SoMD | May 29, 2007 10:40 AM "a God Is a God, no matter what name you choose." Spoken like a Christian SoMD - no regard or knowledge about what anyone else believes, only your assumptions about it. Posted by: Mort | May 30, 2007 06:27 AM SoMD you're right. Randy Jo, you're wrong. If you want to be really technical about it, Christians believe in the Trinity - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit - nowhere is the word God found in there. Also, read this definition of God: 1 capitalized : the supreme or ultimate reality That pretty well seems to cover any belief, whether associated with religion or not, that can exist. God does not mean Christian. It's merely the English word for a concept that has existed in every civilization since the dawn of time. Mort - you're just plain stupid. Allah, Yahwe, Adonai, Krishna...etc. - they ALL mean God, just in different languages. God, the word by itself, as I showed above, carries no connotation of Christianity, merely an understanding that there is something greater than ourselves. Hell, you can even believe in God by the name of God if you don't belong to any religion at all. SoMD supported what he said, while you just throw a meaningless comment out there with no explanation as to your bitterness and religious affront to the word God. Posted by: Little Bull | May 30, 2007 09:58 AM I cant believe you guys are arguing about the god reference ... im pissed that there was no picture of the German chick with huge boobs. Posted by: Ned Mark | May 30, 2007 10:04 AM Actually Little Bull, your full of it. "God" is English for a Christian entity, that is why it is capitalized. It specifically refers to God, not Allah, or Krishna or Yaweh or, as it should, the concept of god generally, but the God of the Holy Bible. Judaism, for instance expressly prohibts the writing of Yahew's name, therefore it is at the very least anti-semetic. Further, no other faith calls the entity they worship God, therefore are dictionaries are slanted by a Christian interpretation. In order for the phrase to be religiously sensitive to all (except of course atheists) it should read: "In a higher power we trust" Posted by: Squatting Bear | May 30, 2007 10:48 AM This is so funny. I'm unsure how anyone who is from the United States of America can question whether or not God when capitalized refers to a Christian God. This country was certainly a haven for extreme or different versions of Christianity from our onset. We have always been majority Christian (argue whether catholics or mormons or mennonites or whomever is Christian later) and therefore the conscious acceptance of God as a reference to the Christian God can only be the correct assumption. Personal politics cannot change facts as they are seen by the majority. The Framers were Christians, and they believed in "God" so think about it for a few minutes and I'm sure you will realize what the coinage is actually implying.

Posted by: jmc | May 30, 2007 02:56 PM i can't believe people still think Jesus was black.

An unnamed European buyer picked up the pink silk cocktail dress, worn by Hepburn's Holly Golightly character, for $192,000 US (including Christie's commission) at a sale of film and entertainment memorabilia on Wednesday. Audrey Hepburn wore this pink silk cocktail dress in the 1961 film Breakfast at Tiffany's. "It captured people's imagination," Helen Hall, Christie's head of entertainment memorabilia, said about the rhinestone-studded dress. Auction house officials in New York had estimated the garment to sell for up to $30,000 US, though at one of its London sales last year, the black column Givenchy dress most often associated with the film sold for more than $932,000 US. The proceeds from the sale of that dress helped build a school south of Calcutta. Other notable items that crossed the block Wednesday included lots related to screen siren Marilyn Monroe, including a script from her unfinished, final film Something's Got to Give â which includes her notes scrawled in the margins â and a program from the Madison Square Garden birthday celebration where she sang to former U.S. president John F. Kennedy. The script sold for $19,200 US, while the program fetched $66,000 US. The auction also saw myriad costumes from classic films, autographed celebrity photos and a binder full of Laurel and Hardy gags offered for sale. Overall, Christie's sold $1.2 million US worth of memorabilia.

BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhuanet) -- A pink cocktail dress worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 film "Breakfast at Tiffany's" was auctioned for 192,000 U.S. dollars in New York on Wednesday, more than six times its estimated value. The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, went to a private European buyer, Christie's auction house said in a statement. The more famous little black dress Hepburn wore in the film sold for more than 800,000 dollars in London last year. Among other lots in Wednesday's memorabilia auction was Marilyn Monroe's script for "Something's Got To Give," with the actress' handwritten notes, which sold for 19,200 dollars. A costume worn by Barbra Streisand in the 1968 film "Funny Girl" went for 33,600 dollars.

On his second day as prosecution witness, Deputy Coroner Louis Pena reasserted the jury that the death was a homicide. When cross questioned by defense lawyer, Pena reaffirmed that presence of gun residue on the victimâs hand does not necessarily mean that she shot herself. He even explained how gun residue could drop on a person when heâs being shot by somebody, by putting his hands around his face and chest. "There are two ways to look at it. It implies the person could have been holding the weapon or been in the vicinity when the weapon was discharged," Pena said. He also told the defense lawyer that even the person who has the gun in hand may not have traces of gun powder after the shot. The prosecution witness disclosed that after examining Clarksonâs body he discovered bruises on her tongue, her right arm and hand which brings out a possibility that she was being threatened with a gun in her mouth and was under the pressure of her murderer. When cross questioned by the defense lawyer about the possibility of the presence of the bruise on the tongue due to the gunshot, the doctor answered that such occurrence was ânot normally seenâ. He also added that there was no way to confirm how fresh the bruises were considering the fact that Lana took a lot of pain medications. He also said that while collecting evidence they found large amount of Clarksonâs blood in the left pocket of Spectorâs pants which suggests that the gun had been placed in the pocket and was also wiped. Being asked to analyze the entire situation, Pena disclosed that he had a different picture of Clarkson in mind. All that he could gather from various sources about her is that she was a hopeful person and had no records of suicide attempts or depression. He also added that a suicide with purse on one shoulder at a strangerâs place was a rare possibility and it is a simple case of murder. "It bothered me a lot that she had her purse on her right shoulder," Pena said yesterday. "It's difficult for someone to take a weapon and shoot herself with the purse staying on her shoulder. It should be off." Defense attorney Christopher Plourd also asked him if there was a possibility that the handbag stayed on her shoulder due to a self inflicted wound. Pena confirmed the possibility but added that the circumstantial and physical analysis made him reach the conclusion that the death was a homicide. The defense attorney tried to shoot down the witnesses stand by saying that it was only once in the court that the forensic expert mentioned the significance of the purse and it was not mentioned anywhere in his reports or notes to which the doctor agreed but insisted that he mentioned it in a meeting once before. When asked about any mistakes that Penaâs team made during the investigation, he answered that one of his dental investigators lost one of Clarksonâs teeth which was kept in a vial. Pena was given a taped vial, which seemed to have been assembled after breakage and wasnât told about the incident for several months. "There were three vials collected to be examined by the odontologist," Pena said. "What happened is on review in meeting with the odontologist he admitted he broke one of the vials and the tooth fragment was lost. It flew around the room somewhere." He also told the jury that the dental investigator sealed the vial again but the fragment was never found. He also conceded that Clarksonâs body was moved in a wrong manner which caused blood to flow out of her mouth making it difficult to evaluate her dress for blood spatter. Forensic expert Henry Lee, was also under the doubt umbrella as a retired sheriff's investigator who worked for Spector's initial attorney told the court he saw Lee hold a piece of fingernail in a handkerchief at the time of inspection of the scene in an earlier hearing. The prosecutor confirmed the incident by showing the jury a photograph of the actressâs bloodstained right hand, which showed that part of her acrylic thumbnail was missing. According to prosecution this finding directly pointed towards a rift that must have happened between Spector and Lana before the killing. They also hinted that the defense hid the evidence to save their case. The defense lawyer cross questioned the doctor all morning and also asked a lot of questions on defense experts Vincent DiMaio and Werner Spitz, whose textbook Pena was consulting during the investigation. The testimony will resume tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Harvey Phillip Spector, 67, is accused of shooting actress Lana Clarkson, 40, through the mouth on 03 February 2003 early morning in his mansion. Spector who is presently free on $1-million bail, on the other hand claims that Lana committed suicide. Spector, 67, the American musician songwriter and record producer will face 15 years of life imprisonment if convicted of murder. Actress Lana Clarkson was famous for her notable performance in the movie Barbarian Queen. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

And yet, reduced to its elements, their job holds undeniable appeal: Go where you want, do what you want, stay up late, ride around in boats, trade in the suit and tie for a sword and scabbard, drink rum from coconut shells, climb rigging, have a pet monkey -- aye, a pirate's life for me (and my monkey). Most pirates we see on TV and movie screens are thoroughly sanitized, and accordingly tend to be financed by buried treasure rather than murder and robbery. Still, where did that treasure come from? Sound investments? No, it came from the coffers of those who died screaming as a pirate asserted his independence right through their necks. Pirate Master, a reality series starting tonight on CTV and CBS, offers the sanitized version. It's a treasure hunt with a boat, but not just any boat, a barque. And not just any shirts --puffy shirts. Email to a friend Sixteen contestants pretend to be pirates. Each week they search for successively larger treasures (total value: US$1-million). The first week alone, the booty is US$40,000 in Spanish doubloons, and just try cashing those in at your Scotiabank. The search takes place on Dominica, a lush Caribbean paradise with a percapita income of US$3,800 a year. The concocted backstory is that an 18th-century pirate by name of Henry Steel was once bedazzled by the sight of, and willing to pay the price for, a treasure known as The Chest of Zanzibar (today, many men experience similar effects with The Chest of Jennifer Love Hewitt). The chest (Zanzibar) has been divided into pieces, and it's what the contestants will be unearthing, a scant 281 years later. The players will elect one pirate as master of the ship. He or she chooses two henchpirates. The other 13 are servants for the master and his minions. At the end of each episode, one pirate is "cut adrift." The servants have the right to mutiny, though it must be a unanimous decision. "What really makes this series pop is the democracy element on the ship," says executive producer Mark Burnett, who is also the man behind Survivor. Burnett is from England and maybe democracy works differently there, but here, a political system based on masters and mutinies is called oligarchy, not democracy. Christian Okoye, a former running back in the National Football League, is one of Pirate Master's 16 corsairs, and many will figure he has a good chance to win. But as someone who's already made his pile, he might bring an overly relaxed attitude to the enterprise -- as did Clyde Drexler, the former basketball eminence, on Dancing With the Stars. Based on previews, I have a soft spot for marina owner Louie Frase, who has the most piratical beard of the bunch. His bio on Pirate Master's Web site tells us: "He is a hard worker and is currently restoring his home. He just finished the roof and is now working on the porch."

Online reported Wednesday. The 20-year-old actress checked into rehab Monday following a weekend that included crashing her Mercedes, being arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence and being photographed slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car. This is her second rehab stint this year. A look at the famous faces making headlines in movies, music and more. Save & Share Article "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay, because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care," Michael Lohan told E! Online. "And I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things. That's a very important step." Lindsay Lohan's publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, did not immediately return an after-hours call and e-mail from The Associated Press on Wednesday. Michael Lohan was released from a New York state prison in March after serving almost two years for driving while intoxicated and other charges. He said he is studying to become a drug-rehab counselor with the faith-based organization Teen Challenge. Before entering rehab, the actress was scheduled to start work this week on "Poor Things," a comedy featuring Shirley MacLaine, who is also a producer on the movie. MacLaine and co-producer Rob Hickman said in a statement Wednesday that Lohan still wants to work on the project. "We are trying to rearrange the shooting schedule to facilitate her working at the end of the shoot to coincide with the completion of her rehabilitation," the statement said. In other events swirling around Lohan, who turns 21 on July 2, authorities who have been conducting undercover operations at trendy celebrity watering holes in recent weeks are seeking to find out if she was served alcohol before her weekend car crash. California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control investigators also want to know if Lohan or others were served after hours, agency spokesman John Carr said. Videos show Lohan leaving Hollywood's Les Deux club at 3:30 a.m. Alcohol cannot be served in California after 2 a.m. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control told the Beverly Hills Police Department it wants to review witness reports and other evidence to determine if a formal investigation is warranted, Carr said. Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore said in a statement that Lohan stayed late having dinner and waiting for friends, and wasn't drinking. Associated Press Writer Jeff Wilson contributed to this report.

Lohan's participation in the movie, , which stars and is produced by Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine, was thrown into question when Lohan checked into a residential treatment facility in Malibu following a weekend drunk driving arrest. But MacLaine and her fellow producer on the film, Rob Hickman, issued a statement expressing support for the 20-year-old actress. "In the spirit of helping Lindsay Lohan and her rehabilitation, we have been asked by Lindsay to comply with her wishes to continue working on ," they said.

No, we're not talking about the ending of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," but about the Memorial Day weekend box-office battle, a once-in-a-lifetime showdown between blockbuster behemoths that ended with a pair of flagships seemingly circling a giant drain. Now that the smoke has cleared on the battlefield of May, let's take a look at the combatants: The fastest ship in the Sony armada, "Spider-Man 3" raced out early to claim the biggest opening weekend in history. After watching both "Shrek the Third" and "Pirates" fall far short of the mark, we're beginning to think Spidey's $151 three-day haul might be uncatchable. Like the Black Pearl, however, Spidey has this nagging problem of losing half its crew at every stop. For the third weekend in a row, Spidey fell more than 50 percent, finishing with $14.2 million for the three-day weekend ($18 million including Monday). It finally crawled past $300 million in 24 days, five days longer than it took "Spider-Man" to hit the mark and two days longer than it took "Spider-Man 2." Despite its menacing speed out of the gate, the third Spidey will wind up, domestically, the lowest grossing of the series. It's crewed by an army of the undead, computer-generated characters who don't age, don't revolt, and most importantly, are designed to perfectly reflect their surroundings. (Is there a cooler metaphor for "makes pop-culture jokes" than that?) "Shrek the Third" powered its way to a $122 million opening, a record for an animated feature and the third-highest of all time. But with $69 million over the four-day weekend, the irascible ogre fell 43 percent &#8212; a far cry from the 12 percent the second film fell over the same period three years ago. Be still my beating heart &#8212; it might be time for a change of captains if this seemingly never-ending franchise is to continue forever. "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" With the largest launch of all time (4,362 theaters), "Pirates" stood, like the East India Company flagship, ready to take over the world. Alas, it was blown to bits by the combined power of the Dutchman and the Pearl. OK, not exactly. But with $115 million from Friday through Sunday and $142 million over the four-day holiday, the third installment in the "Pirates" series came up far short of last year's "Dead Man's Chest" and behind this month's openings for both "Shrek" and "Spider-Man." It's not time to walk the plank yet, though. With $156.1 million including Thursday previews, "Pirates" snagged the biggest Memorial Day booty in history, and, with an estimated $245 million internationally, the second-largest global opening ever. It pains us. It really does. And not because we don't like the guy &#8212; we do &#8212; but because he had a little fun at our expense last week when we asked him to participate in our contest (see "Pirates Are Looking To Loot Spider-Man And Shrek, In ). But that said, we have no choice but to award the crown to Jerry Springer, who came closest to the final "Pirates" tally with a prediction of $127 million. I can't say I blame Larry and Josh for their optimistic projections, but &#8212; no, you know what, I blame them [throws chair]. Sorry, got a little carried away there thinking about Jerry. Josh Horowitz, MTV Movies editor (15) Larry Carroll, MTV News writer (9) Can we finally call these numbers set? Please? Pretty please with sugar on top? After a crazy May, this is the third time in as many weeks that we've rewritten the record books. Is there another film on the horizon that can crack this top five? God, we hope not. Here are the top five highest-grossing opening weekends of all time: #1 "Spider-Man 3" ($151.1 million) #2 "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest" ($135.6 million) #3 "Shrek the Third" ($121.6 million) #4 "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" ($115 million) #5 "Spider-Man" ($114.8 million) Get a babysitter and leave the kiddies at home, next week is for the adults.

Gough NEW YORK (Hollywood Reporter) - The "American Idol" finale drove Fox to a primetime ratings win for the week ended Sunday, the last day of the 2006/07 season, according to Nielsen Media Research. ABC was first out of the gate last week with Monday's "Dancing With the Stars" (20.2 million viewers, 5.3 rating/15 share in adults 18-49) and the finale of "The Bachelor: An Officer and a Gentleman" (12.7 million, 4.8/12). But NBC's "Heroes" (13.5 million, 6.2/15) coming out ahead of both in the key demo. Fox's "24" concluded its season with a sub-par 10.3 million, 3.8/10. The penultimate episode of "Idol" (25.3 million, 9.7/27) gave Fox the win in adults 18-49 Tuesday, but a poor showing by the premiere of Fox's Steven Spielberg reality series "On the Lot" (7.6 million, 3.6/9) allowed ABC to win in viewership thanks to the "Dancing" finale (23 million, 6.7/17). Fox again proved victorious Wednesday with the two-hour-plus finale of "Idol" (30.7 million, 11.5/31), which competed for an hour against ABC's two-hour season finale of "Lost" (13.9 million, 5.9/15). Thursday saw the premiere of "So You Think You Can Dance" (9.5 million, 3.7/12), which helped Fox win the night in 18-49 despite a second poor showing from "On the Lot" (5.2 million, 2.1/6). But CBS won in viewership with a night of repeats highlighted by "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation" (13.8 million, 4.1/12), which even beat "Dance" in the demo. ABC and CBS split Friday, with CBS winning in viewership and ABC in the demo thanks to "National Bingo Night" (5.5 million, 1.8/6) and "20/20" (5.8 million, 1.6/6). CBS won Saturday in viewers with two hours of "48 Hours Mystery" (5.5 million, 1.2/4 and 7.1 million, 2.0/7), while Fox won the demo. Sunday was a day and night of racing, with ABC's Indianapolis 500 averaging 6.4 million viewers and a 1.9 in 18-49, while Fox's running of NASCAR's 600 in primetime averaged 7.5 million viewers and a 2.7 rating in the demo. It was the seventh consecutive year that the 600 topped the 500. For the week, Fox averaged 11.6 million viewers and a 4.4/14 in the demo, followed by CBS (9 million, 2.2/7), ABC (8.9 million, 3.0/9), NBC (5.5 million, 1.9/6) and the CW network (2 million, 0.8/2). &copy; Reuters 2007.

On his second day as prosecution witness, Deputy Coroner Louis Pena reasserted the jury that the death was a homicide. When cross questioned by defense lawyer, Pena reaffirmed that presence of gun residue on the victimâs hand does not necessarily mean that she shot herself. He even explained how gun residue could drop on a person when heâs being shot by somebody, by putting his hands around his face and chest. "There are two ways to look at it. It implies the person could have been holding the weapon or been in the vicinity when the weapon was discharged," Pena said. He also told the defense lawyer that even the person who has the gun in hand may not have traces of gun powder after the shot. The prosecution witness disclosed that after examining Clarksonâs body he discovered bruises on her tongue, her right arm and hand which brings out a possibility that she was being threatened with a gun in her mouth and was under the pressure of her murderer. When cross questioned by the defense lawyer about the possibility of the presence of the bruise on the tongue due to the gunshot, the doctor answered that such occurrence was ânot normally seenâ. He also added that there was no way to confirm how fresh the bruises were considering the fact that Lana took a lot of pain medications. He also said that while collecting evidence they found large amount of Clarksonâs blood in the left pocket of Spectorâs pants which suggests that the gun had been placed in the pocket and was also wiped. Being asked to analyze the entire situation, Pena disclosed that he had a different picture of Clarkson in mind. All that he could gather from various sources about her is that she was a hopeful person and had no records of suicide attempts or depression. He also added that a suicide with purse on one shoulder at a strangerâs place was a rare possibility and it is a simple case of murder. "It bothered me a lot that she had her purse on her right shoulder," Pena said yesterday. "It's difficult for someone to take a weapon and shoot herself with the purse staying on her shoulder. It should be off." Defense attorney Christopher Plourd also asked him if there was a possibility that the handbag stayed on her shoulder due to a self inflicted wound. Pena confirmed the possibility but added that the circumstantial and physical analysis made him reach the conclusion that the death was a homicide. The defense attorney tried to shoot down the witnesses stand by saying that it was only once in the court that the forensic expert mentioned the significance of the purse and it was not mentioned anywhere in his reports or notes to which the doctor agreed but insisted that he mentioned it in a meeting once before. When asked about any mistakes that Penaâs team made during the investigation, he answered that one of his dental investigators lost one of Clarksonâs teeth which was kept in a vial. Pena was given a taped vial, which seemed to have been assembled after breakage and wasnât told about the incident for several months. "There were three vials collected to be examined by the odontologist," Pena said. "What happened is on review in meeting with the odontologist he admitted he broke one of the vials and the tooth fragment was lost. It flew around the room somewhere." He also told the jury that the dental investigator sealed the vial again but the fragment was never found. He also conceded that Clarksonâs body was moved in a wrong manner which caused blood to flow out of her mouth making it difficult to evaluate her dress for blood spatter. Forensic expert Henry Lee, was also under the doubt umbrella as a retired sheriff's investigator who worked for Spector's initial attorney told the court he saw Lee hold a piece of fingernail in a handkerchief at the time of inspection of the scene in an earlier hearing. The prosecutor confirmed the incident by showing the jury a photograph of the actressâs bloodstained right hand, which showed that part of her acrylic thumbnail was missing. According to prosecution this finding directly pointed towards a rift that must have happened between Spector and Lana before the killing. They also hinted that the defense hid the evidence to save their case. The defense lawyer cross questioned the doctor all morning and also asked a lot of questions on defense experts Vincent DiMaio and Werner Spitz, whose textbook Pena was consulting during the investigation. The testimony will resume tomorrow at 9:30 a.m. Harvey Phillip Spector, 67, is accused of shooting actress Lana Clarkson, 40, through the mouth on 03 February 2003 early morning in his mansion. Spector who is presently free on $1-million bail, on the other hand claims that Lana committed suicide. Spector, 67, the American musician songwriter and record producer will face 15 years of life imprisonment if convicted of murder. Actress Lana Clarkson was famous for her notable performance in the movie Barbarian Queen. The content of this field is kept private and will not be shown publicly.

Eventually we&#39;re treated to a full view of the sloshed swashbuckler we&#39;ve been waiting a half hour to see, yet before Sparrow can pop the peanut in his mouth, he&#39;s shot dead. By Johnny Depp&#39;s Captain Jack Sparrow. Sparrow, you see, is trapped in the Land of the Dead, and in his solitary, food-, water-, and rum-deprived purgatory state, is hallucinating that he is, in fact, surrounded by shipmates, all of whom bear an uncanny resemblance to himself. ( Charlie and the Chocolate Factory &#39;s Willy Wonka has turned himself the Oompa-Loompas.) For a few, brief minutes the audience is given roughly twenty times the Johnny Depp for its money, and it&#39;s a pretty fair approximation of the experience as a whole. For a big-budget blockbuster sequel, the film doesn&#39;t provide as many Big-Budget Blockbuster Moments as maybe it should. But there are so many inspired, quirky, throwaway bits here that is enjoyable even while you&#39;re bemoaning its incoherence and occasional portentousness and the gaping hole that is the movie&#39;s romantic sub-plot. What it lacks in clarity is more than made up for in personality and frequent imagination; when the movie works, it works about twenty times better than a preordained mega-hit It&#39;s not as though the filmmakers seem if if you&#39;re up to speed on the niceties of the movie&#39;s plotting, as they so much as us so 10 minutes into the film. In the midst of a heated discussion with Singapore&#39;s Pirate King (Chow Yun-Fat), Keira Knightley&#39;s Elizabeth Swann begins to deliver catch-up information from the previous film&#39;s storyline (a great relief to those of us who couldn&#39;t explain &#39;s storyline if you us to). Yet while she recounts her experiences, the one-eyed pirate played by Mackenzie Crook is seen from the floorboards beneath Elizabeth, salaciously peeking up her dress. The audience, expectedly, laughs - Crook&#39;s gleeful enjoyment of the moment made laugh, too - and it&#39;s not until this sketch-comedy side-bar ends that you realize how much exposition you probably while you were laughing. Yet our confusion about the film&#39;s many, plotlines isn&#39;t necessarily a detriment here - Verbinski could almost be saying, "Follow the plot, follow the plot... we&#39;ll amuse you regardless." For those of us who found a sporadically enthralling but wildly oppressive entertainment, the lightness of comes as welcome relief, and is never more apparent than in Depp&#39;s scenes. In the last film, the actor seemed to get unjustly Swallow-ed in the relentless shenanigans. Here, though, he seems rejuvenated. Not only do his flouncing movements appear possessed of rediscovered vigor, but his line readings have renewed bite as well; in describing Naomie Harris&#39; mysterious goddess Tia Dalma, the way Depp wraps his besotted tongue around "a woman scorned like which fury hell no" is enough to get you giggling. Once he finally appears, Depp&#39;s presence is blessedly continual, but even if he were around far often, there are always performers giving their roles more passion - and having more fun doing so - than Hollywood blockbusters traditionally allow. For my money, the best shot in was its very last one, when Geoffrey Rush&#39;s Barbossa miraculously returned from the dead; that film needed a blast of the actor&#39;s malevolent-pirate shtick. But while Rush&#39;s "How the hell did happen?" resurrection is only marginally explained in , you could care less about the mechanics involved - Rush is back, and God bless. Throwing his head back and widening his eyes as though channeling Norma Desmond, Rush spits out lines such as "What you doin&#39;?" with ingratiating vehemence, and Harris is just as wickedly gratifying, her voodoo-priestess delivered with an insinuating purr. Rush&#39;s and Harris&#39; character accents are so deliriously, broadly musical that it barely what they&#39;re saying; their rhythmic mellifluousness provides an enjoyment all its own. Nearly actor for actor, the cast appears to be having far more fun than they did in , and then you&#39;re faced with Orlando Bloom. Now that the films have (perhaps) run their course, it&#39;s probably too late to ask: "What can be done about Orlando Bloom?", but seriously - what can be done about Orlando Bloom? He was just fine as a lightly comic romantic actor in the first , but he&#39;s deadly dull when striving for emotional honesty (and not just in this franchise), and unfortunately, he&#39;s almost single-handedly responsible for making large chunks of not work. Given his drearily self-regarding performance, Will&#39;s reunion with his father, played by Stellan Skarsgaard, has little heft - the nearly unrecognizable Skarsgaard provides the plotline&#39;s only hints at true feeling - and the mopey tar&#39;s climactic, mid-battle proposal to Elizabeth is an embarrassment that briefly stops the movie cold. Considering everything going on around him, though, it&#39;s easy to forget about Bloom. (Or at least find ways to him: In the midst of the film&#39;s near-three hour running length, my friend had to use the restroom, and we agreed that any time a scene began with Bloom looking "tormented" was a pretty safe time to go.) We get Bill Nighy again lending legitimate pathos to his squid-faced Jones, the hatefully delightful Teacup Acting of Tom Hollander&#39;s Captain Beckett and a (too-short) cameo by the rock icon who served as Sparrow&#39;s inspiration. (Strange to say, but Depp&#39;s Captain Jack is now more Keith Richards than Keith Richards.) We get Knightley&#39;s increasingly spirited Elizabeth, who manages to get herself elected King of the Pirates. (It&#39;s that kind of movie.) And, every once in a while, we do get the Big-Budget Blockbuster moments, which, in sequel at any rate, are peppered with refreshing hints of artistry; the oceanic battles are more than impressively staged, but just as engrossing is the suggestive creepiness of the Land of the Dead sequence, and a beautifully-staged stand-off, and the comic exuberance of Sparrow&#39;s plan for returning from that netherworld... by tipping his rescuers&#39; ship upside down. Verbinski may never become a director, like Spielberg or Peter Jackson, but an imaginative one - and one with a true gift for slapstick mayhem - is nothing to shrug at. Neither are the minor moments in that end up providing major pleasure. I can&#39;t argue with claims that the movie is over-produced and unfocused and overly complicated, but I didn&#39;t leave feeling gypped. Any endeavor that finds two miniature Jack Sparrows hanging from their progenitor&#39;s cornrows - dispensing advice as if he were Tom Hulce in than its share of amusement. written by Luke skywalker, May 30, 2007 Lets face it Spiderman series are better then pirates series (Spiderman 3,Pirates 2 stank). But star wars is the best of all........... written by Ricky, May 30, 2007 Don't be so obviously jealous Mike. Orlando was awesome in this film, far better and more improved than in the last two films. He made the ending awesome. Don't get pissy just because he's better looking than you. written by None of your business, May 30, 2007 Blah blah blah. Doesn't the endless Orlando Bloom bashing get old? Ask the fans of the movie if they like him in it and I believe you will get an overwhelming YES. And we matter more than you. Thanks. written by Diana, May 30, 2007 I thought the movie was great. Not confusing at all and very funny. But I don't see why Bloom's performance is being criticized in such a negative way. He played out his character Turner accordingly and that was that. What could any other actor have done differently if they'd been in his shoes??? Everybody should just see this or any other movie with one goal in mind. To be entertained and not nit-pick! written by KaizokuSanji, May 30, 2007 No, let's face the fact that Pirates is the best to come along in a long time. Spiderman is good but not as Great as Pirates so that's why it did this well. Pirates = Amazing. Stupid Critics. Why do we even have critics anyway? All they do now is tell us the audience how stupid we all are for liking what we like and try and force boring ass movies down our throats. Stupid elitists. written by Valerie, May 30, 2007 I liked the review - nicely done - although I do think there was more to Will then you gave him and you must admit when he comes back to fight that battle with Captain Jack - it was great!!!! Goodbye Beckett! Looking for more of Captain Jack Sparrow that only Johnny Depp can do! written by ali, May 30, 2007 i'm confused! how can Orlando be condemned and the rest of the actors and actresses be praised? orli is far better than half of the actors on this movie why is he always so heavily criticized? written by ya mom, May 30, 2007 looks like someone's jealous much. just cuz your not even half as good looking as Orlando Bloom doesn't give you the right to talk trash about him. I thought he did great. written by David, May 31, 2007 I think Orlando did a great job of the tragic hero at least he and Keira had more to do this movie than run around screaming like the last pirates. They killed the wrong man Depp should have gone to Davey's Locker instead. written by Melissa, May 31, 2007 I have to disagree. I being a mild fan of Orlando (yes..he is gorgeous and yes sometimes he really irritates me in a film) thought he did a fine job with the character arch of Will Turner. He was stuffy and uptight in P1. In P2 he was trying to make his way, starting to wheel and deal, if albeit stupidly with inexperience. And by P3, he really was getting the hang of "thinking like Jack". What I DID find annoying was the love story triangle revisited. Everyone knows Elizabeth sent Jack to the Locker as a way to save Will. Enough about Elizabeth really having any true feelings for Jack. Her true feelings were torn between doing the right thing, and like any other spoilt brat..getting her own way. SHE annoys me entirely. She's too angsty as her role as Elizabeth, too whiny. Everything is an issue for her. I get that the entire trilogy was mainly about her arch..about what she became, not who she was going to "wind up with", but I think the person with the most complete character arch was in fact Will Turner. Any actor, given the same material, would have been the same as Orlando's performance. It was fine, and credit is given where it is justly due. About the multiple Jacks. I felt like I really lost a good portion of my life when I was watching that scene..and the dreadlock hanging Jack scenes. They were information fillers only. It was annoying and unneeded. Not enough is said about Bill Nighy I'm afraid. He is AMAZING. Davy Jones was so complete in this film, and the parallel between the Davy and Calypso/Will and Elizabeth story is undaunting. There was only one true choice for who is to be the next Dutchman Captain. I was a huge Jack fan going into the third film, and came out a big Will/Elizabeth supporter.

May 31 2007 11:50 AM EDT Lindsay Lohan At The Crossroads: Has She Worn Out Her Welcome In Hollywood? Actress' father says she's an addict; film producers rearrange shooting schedule to accommodate rehab stint. As the dust slowly settles from a wild weekend that landed Lindsay Lohan in headlines and (ultimately) rehab, the actress is getting support from some quarters and threats of unreturned calls from others, as the Hollywood establishment decides whether or not she's gone too far. According to her estranged father, Lohan is suffering from multiple addictions that include alcohol and the powerful, highly addictive painkiller OxyContin. E! Online reported the news on Wednesday, quoting Michael Lohan, who said, "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay, because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care ... And I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things. That's a very important step." Prior to last weekend's car crash and subsequent trip to rehab (see "Lindsay Lohan Checks Into Rehab: Report" ), Lohan was slated to start filming a role in the dark comedy "Poor Things" this week. Shirley MacLaine, one of the film's stars and producers, said in a statement that Lohan still wants to be in the movie and that, "we are trying to rearrange the shooting schedule to facilitate her working at the end of the shoot to coincide with the completion of her rehabilitation." Lohan's hard partying and unflattering paparazzi photos from the weekend &#8212; including widely circulated ones from Monday in which she appears to be passed out in a friend's car &#8212; may have seriously derailed what was a promising Hollywood career. According to a story in The New York Times , the repeated bad behavior by Lohan, culminating with her second trip to rehab in three months, might finally have dropped her off decision makers' short lists for upcoming film projects. An unidentified studio head told the paper he would not hire Lohan again until she proved herself to be healthy and reliable, and the paper speculated that to get work again, the "Georgia Rule" star might have to post her salary as a bond or pay for her own insurance to minimize studio risk. Well before her latest problems, an executive at Disney &#8212; where she made four movies, including "Freaky Friday" and "Herbie: Fully Loaded" &#8212; sat her down in 2005 and explained to the young actress that she was at a crucial crossroads. Nina Jacobson, who ran the studio at the time, told the "I told her before the movie began, 'This is the moment in your career where you either become Kristy McNichol or Jodie Foster" &#8212; two former child actresses whose careers took divergent paths. Lohan was fine on the set of "Herbie," but she reportedly went missing during the international press tour in Europe to promote the movie. "The image issue aside, professionalism-wise we were disappointed," Jacobson said. "And I was sad, because she's so charismatic and appealing onscreen. It's a very sad thing to see it go to waste this way." Lohan's spokesperson did not return calls and e-mails requesting comment. Assuming she spends the expected 30 days at the Promises rehabilitation facility, Lohan might be forced to put off the recording of her next album, which she recently told MTV News was going to have an "urban pop" sound and which she had planned to spend four months recording, beginning in June or July. The rehab stint will also knock Lohan out of her previously announced appearance at this weekend's MTV Movie Awards, breaking a three-year streak of hosting or presenting at the event (see "MTV Movie Awards Get Even Sexier With Cameron Diaz, Jessica Biel, Mandy Moore" Lohan's career might not be the only thing in jeopardy after the weekend. California authorities are also investigating whether Lohan, who turns 21 on July 2, was illegally served alcohol while partying at the Hollywood club Les Deux over the weekend, and if the bar served her after the state-mandated 2 a.m. last call. In response to a number of incidents in which underage stars were seemingly served alcohol at trendy nightspots, authorities have been conducting undercover investigations in recent weeks to see if the clubs are providing alcohol to patrons who are underage. reported that the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control is reviewing tapes that show Lohan leaving the Les Deux club in Hollywood at 3:30 a.m. A club spokesperson said Lohan was eating dinner at the club and not drinking and that she stayed late because a horde of paparazzi were waiting for her outside.

Abracadabra: Daniel Radcliffe stars as Harry Potter in "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," which will open in theaters July 11. - Murray Close / Associated Press "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," the fifth in the film series based on the mega-popular books about a boy wizard battling evil at Hogwarts Academy, will be released July 11, two days earlier than the original July 13 arrival. Officials from Warner Bros., which is distributing the film, did not say whether they were trying to avoid bad luck with a Friday the 13th opening. But one motivation could be the boost in ticket sales that will be recorded for the movie's opening five-day "weekend." In "Phoenix," Harry must deal with a new faction at school that doubts his encounters with the evil Lord Voldemort are legitimate. The seventh and final book in the series, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," is still scheduled for release July 21.

The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, which regulates liquor licensing, is looking into whether alcohol was served illegally to Lohan in the hours before her arrest by police in Beverly Hills, an agency spokesman said on Wednesday. The 20-year-old actress was booked on suspicion of driving under the influence after running her Mercedes over a curb and into a hedge at about 5:30 a.m. on Saturday. Police said they also found a substance in the car they believe to be cocaine. Her arrest came about two hours after she was seen leaving a popular Hollywood eatery. It was followed by a second night of partying that ended early Monday with Lohan captured in widely published photos passed out in the front seat of a car. Later that day, Lohan, an acknowledged Alcoholic Anonymous member who underwent rehab earlier this year, checked herself into another treatment facility. Lohan's latest woes cast doubt about whether the promising young actress, publicly rebuked by a producer last year for on-set tardiness, would be available to begin shooting her next film as planned with Oscar winner Shirley MacLaine. Her arrest also focused attention on the nightclubs and restaurants that cater to Hollywood's rich and famous and their complicity in serving alcohol to individuals under the legal drinking age of 21. A flurry of reports about underage stars and lesser-known minors frequenting Los Angeles-area nightspots prompted the state's ABC board to launch an enforcement crackdown that has resulted in 10 undercover operations so far, agency spokesman John Carr said. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Breaking news E-mail alerts Get breaking news in your inbox as it happens Messing's starting over in 'Starter Wife' By Donna Freydkin, USA TODAY NEW YORK &#151; Last spring, Debra Messing endured a searing breakup, one that flattened her for two full days. "I was devastated. I was numb and confused," the actress says over tea at the Mercer Hotel in Manhattan. "It was just such an emotionally overwhelming thing." 'Starter Wife' is well-made fluff Debra Messing answers your questions See a clip from 'Starter Wife' She's talking about her last day playing ditzy, droll interior decorator Grace Adler on NBC's groundbreaking hit , which ended its eight-season run last May. But Messing could just as easily be referring to her latest character, plucky divorc&#233;e Molly in the six-hour telefilm , premiering tonight (USA, 9 ET/PT). Like Messing, Molly grapples with momentous changes. Messing went from being one of NBC's Emmy-winning shining stars to unemployed actress. Molly learns, via a phone call, that her Hollywood-studio-head husband is dumping her. "Change is scary. You see that in , and I experienced it with . It's interesting to me that Molly doesn't crawl into bed," Messing says. "I didn't get out of bed for two days. I slept. I didn't do anything." And although Messing, 38, is happily married to screenwriter Daniel Zelman and is the mother of son Roman, 3, she can relate to Molly's turmoil. "Molly and I were going through an incredibly similar experience," Messing says. " was an eight-year marriage, and it ended. I didn't know what I should do next, what I could do next or what I wanted to do next. For eight years, I wasn't allowed to ask those questions." Don't expect Grace Adler's madcap energy and zany sensibility from the actress, who in person is crisp, businesslike and focused. She's well-read, and to maximize her time, she devours books, such as Orhan Pamuk's , "that have a seal on the cover that either says Nobel Prize or the Booker Prize," she says. About the only goofiness on display comes courtesy of her cellphone ringtones: the themes from The Price Is Right "I've spent my life trying to be cool and realizing that I've been a 95-year-old nerd since I was 12," she says, cracking one of just a few smiles. Now that she's not sharing a spacious pad with Will Truman on the Upper West Side, Messing calls herself "a dancing monkey. I'm an actress for hire. I'm not a writer. I'm just waiting for the person to say, 'Debra, you're the person to do this.' " Despite recent supporting turns in feature films (Curtis Hanson's ), she's not angling to go back to work right away. "I have a very full personal life that fulfills me in a way that nothing else can," Messing says. "Having flexibility right now is something I'm enjoying. For eight years, I had a very structured life. Now, I can go wherever I want, whenever I want." On a typical day, she wakes up with her son, puts him down for a nap, takes him to the park, makes dinner and gives him a bath. "We get into pajamas and snuggle and watch ," she says. "The only thing I would add to my day to make it better is more hours, so I could spend an hour reading by myself and an extra hour to sleep. And some more dates with my husband."

Ashley Judd (left) and Harry Connick Jr. star in 'Bug.' PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLD'S END (PG-13) HH STARRING: JOHNNY DEPP, KEIRA KNIGHTLY, ORLANDO BLOOM, GEOFFREY RUSH, CHOW YUN-FAT RUNNING TIME: 168 MIN. The biggest threat to the three main characters here doesn't come from cannon fire, sharp swords or even drowning in sea battles. No, what almost does in the charm and appeal of the third in the Captain Jack Sparrow films is its very bloat. The film suffers from a cobbled-together plot that has so much going on that it very nearly sinks under its own weight. With nearly three hours of action, romance, subplots and just plain silliness to work through, moviegoers will find themselves wiggling in their seats with too many story lines they don't care about. Thanks goodness that every time the tale gets slow and overdone, Depp's visage pops up onscreen. As Sparrow, one of the most memorable characters on the screen in recent years, he saves the action every time he appears. Yes, sometimes he seems as though he's joking with his portrayal, making Sparrow a silly sort of pirate. But he almost winks as he does it, letting you in on the fact that he's having a ball playing this rascally pirate. So you can't help but join him in the merriment. The same holds true to a somewhat smaller extent for Knightly and Bloom as the swashbuckling Elizabeth and the adventurous Will. The first film worked so well because it never strayed far from at least one of the trio. This time out, things get all caught up with Davy Jones, Capt. Barbossa, James Norrington, Bootstrap Bill Turner, Lord Beckett and the ubiquitous Calypso, to the point where the story loses steam from so much sidetracking. The problem begins at the movie's opening, when a group of common folk, including a young boy, is hanged for supposedly supporting or being pirates. What does this add to anything? Nothing, but it is a warning of things to come throughout. Ditto for a long, goofy venture into a version of Davy Jones' Locker that looks an awful lot like a deserted island. When rocks turn into crabs and carry a grounded Black Pearl to a nearby beach, we wonder what Sparrow's been smoking. Battle scenes don't go on as long as in the second film, but there's a whole segment with Yun-Fat's character that doesn't add a thing. Those looking for an amazing moment when Rolling Stone Keith Richards takes the screen as Sparrow's pirate dad will be disappointed as well. Sure, it's cool seeing the rock world collide with a major motion picture, but Richards is as leaden as the gold that all these pirates yearn for.

"Knocked Up" seals the title for Apatow, the delightfully twisted director/writer of the daffy hit comedy "The 40-Year-Old Virgin" and creator of the short-lived television series "Freaks and Geeks." About that title, "Knocked Up." What a perfectly saucy, sassy and outrageous title for a hilariously irreverent look at romance and sex. This adult comedy earns every aspect of its R rating for its sexy scenes, adult language, raunchy jokes and humorous drug use. Paradoxically, "Knocked Up" qualifies as one of the sweetest, most optimistic views of modern romance I've seen in recent years. Allison Scott (Katherine Hegl), left, waits anxiously with her sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) for the results of a pregnancy test in the Judd Apatow comedy "Knocked Up" I say this despite some abrupt, graphic close-ups of Katherine Heigl's most private region (or at least her stunt double's most private region) as she gives birth to a baby conceived during a night of booze and stupidity. As he did in "Virgin," Apatow spins a story of unexpectedly empathetic characters caught up in juvenile jokes and bathroom humor. Yet, he makes villains of no one and virtual heroes out of all. Every character in "Knocked Up" starts out as an instantly identifiable movie type. But as the story unfolds, Apatow's characters prove themselves to be more than we originally assume. Not just the main characters, either. Nope. All of them, even the small ones such as the rude, obnoxious pediatrician who rediscovers his bedside manner after a verbal pistol-whipping. Or a club bouncer who stands around like a movie prop until he summarizes his job requirements in a knee-slapping monologue way too honest for his miffed female patrons. Or Ben Stone (Seth Rogen), who appears to be a brainless but lovable frat-boy cliché until he knocks up Alison Scott (Heigl) after a boozy one-night stand during which he misconstrues her wishes and forgoes the use of a condom. A few weeks later, Alison realizes somebody made a mistake. She becomes pregnant at the same time she receives her anxiously awaited promotion to be a news announcer on E! How did this promising young woman on the cusp of a dream job get knocked up by a doofus whose maturity level locked in somewhere around his freshman year? Alison's very married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann, alias the real Mrs. Apatow and a featured player in "The 40-Year-Old Virgin") seems more interested in herself than in helping Alison. In a regular movie, Mann's harpy housewife would have remained an easy villain. Apatow gives Debbie a character arc that brings her vulnerability to the surface and renders her all too human. The same thing happens to Paul Rudd, another "Virgin" veteran. He hangs in the background as Debbie's deferring husband Pete, until he gets a chance to show what he's made of. "Knocked Up," like "Virgin" and other Apatow projects, has a knack for addressing life's natural messes with bemused curiosity. It delves into ferociously anti-PC territory, running headlong into issues of maturity, drugs and responsibility, all while armed with a rapier sense of humor and a great affection for its characters. Especially for Heigl, the star of TV's successful dramatic series "Grey's Anatomy." The actress is a magnet for our empathy, and she constructs a character with such credibility that we accept it when Alison decides to try a relationship with Ben, a father-in-law's certifiable worst nightmare. As Ben, Rogen projects a chilling slacker attitude with something hidden beneath the surface. Something good. In a world where lives get buffeted by the twists of uncaring fate, Rogen's Ben is a well-meaning young man whose heart exceeds his IQ. In the Apatow universe, what matters more than that?  Want to write your own review of this movie? Go to www.dailyherald.com/timeout.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End Ted Elliot and Terry Rossio Rated PG-13 for intense sequences of action/adventure violence and some frightening images. Ill be honest, Im somewhat at a loss as to how to review a movie like Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End , for a couple reasons. First off, its not like any criticism leveled at it, from me or any other critic, is gonna stop everyone from seeing it. Id say Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Mans Chest Secondly, I find my normal reviewing style somewhat useless with this film. As anyone who has read any of my previous reviews knows, I like to first write about the films story, and then spend a little time examining different individual aspects of the movie, like the directing, writing, acting, etc. But whats the point of that with a film like , when all people really care about is one thing. Oh sure, there will be the small contingent of young girls going to swoon over Orlando Bloom, and I know theres still that cluster of folks who just think anything involving pirates is cool (theyll be the ones dressed as pirates at the screenings). But, lets face it, nearly everyone else will be going for one reason, and one reason only: Captain Jack Sparrow. Perhaps then, I should just let you know the good, and bad, news. The good news is Johnny Depp is still compelling as always, his Capt. Jack remains one of cinemas most bizarre and engaging anti-heroes. The bad news is that, with this third film in the series, the makers of  own interest in Capt. Jack seems to be waning a little quicker than the audiences. At least, that appears to be the case, as Jack is essentially shoved aside and lost amidst an overwhelming cavalcade of twists, turns, character revelations, betrayals, red herrings, and, by the end of the whole thing, just flat-out audience exhaustion. It really is enough to make one pine for the simple, good-old-days of the first film, when we only had three or four parallel stories to follow. picks up shortly after the last films cliffhanger finale, with Will Turner (Bloom) and Elizabeth Swann (Kiera Knightley), now working together with the recently resurrected Captain Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) and voodoo queen Tia Dalma (Naomie Harris), meeting with Captain Sao Feng, the pirate lord of Singapore (Chow Yun-Fat). It turns out Feng is in possession of a map that can help them rescue Jack from Davy Jones Locker, the afterlife he was condemned to after being swallowed by the monstrous Kraken  and what an afterlife it is, a sort-of purgatory where Jack is forced to captain a land-locked ship crewed by multiple versions of himself. Its completely insane and, thanks to the bonus Depps, one of the films most memorable scenes. Unfortunately, its somewhat downhill from there, as our heroes manage to escape this strange limbo and embark on their mission; namely, a gathering of the nine pirate lords, where they will decide how to deal with the threat posed by the East India Trading Company, now more powerful than ever thanks to a forced alliance with Davy Jones (Bill Nighy), who is none-too-happy to be following anyones orders. This story probably could have been kept simple, but instead it quickly spins wildly out of control, eventually buckling under the weight of its numerous sub-plots, not to mention its unnecessary two hour and 48 minute running time. Its arguable that the makers of these films have lost sight of what made the first film so enjoyable in the first place. At the end of the day, Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl was nothing more than a simple, undemanding pirate/ghost story, something that hadnt been pulled offhell, even attempted, in years. But with , and now even more so , the writers, producers, and director appear uncertain that such a straightforward formula can keep the audiences interests through multiple films. I wish they had at least given it a shot. In my opinion, simplicity is not always a bad thing, and it probably would have been vastly superior to what we have been given instead. Rather than replicate the breathless, giddy exhilaration of the first film, the sequels creak awkwardly along, victims of a desire to establish their own Lord of the Rings -like mythology, complete with too many characters, too much back-story, and way too many undeveloped ideas. I thought , with its multiple storylines and characters, was too ambitious, but makes Raimis film look like is so bloated with extraneous elements, it sometimes seems like even the writers have lost track of it all  a strange and confusing scene in which a character mistakes Elizabeth for an ancient sea Goddess is never explained, nor resolved. Whats worse, the amazing sword fights and imaginative action scenes that graced the first two films are here sacrificed to make way for the far-too-many scenes of people talking, which are unfortunately necessary to constantly explain what the hell is going on. Dont get me wrong, the giant sea battle that makes up s climax is somewhat impressive, but also is a tad too CGI-reliant and impersonal to be all exciting, not to mention it has a definite been there, done that feeling. Some people complained that the three-way sword fight atop the giant rolling wheel in was superfluous and too over-the-top, but I would have killed for a scene that exciting in But perhaps no sin is more unforgivable than the bizarre decision to take the focus off of Sparrow. For all its characters and stories, the franchise has always rested almost entirely on Depps shoulders. And, to this point, he has risen admirably to the challenge, serving as the series beating heart, infusing the previous films with a madcap, devilish spirit. And yes, he does so again  whenever Jack is on screen the film noticeably regains some of its life, particularly in his hilarious exchanges with Rushs Captain Barbossa (without a doubt the series second best character  Rushs presence is definitely one of the few improvements over the last film). If theres any downside to Jack this time around its that he is no longer as new and fresh as he was the first time we saw him, and therefore his odd persona is no longer the delightful surprise it once was. Still, the character remains incredibly captivating, and Depp does a nice job reminding us why we fell in love with the franchise in the first place. How sad it is, then, to see Jack this time shunted off to the peripheral for a good portion of the film. Rather than being the driving force that moves the films many storylines along, Jack is here just another cog in the machine, one more character lost in a sea of confusion, overshadowed by the films unrelenting onslaught of ideas and revelations. Further exacerbating the problem is that, by taking the focus off of Jack, it means it's shifted more towards Elizabeth and Will, which only serves to remind us how boring these characters are. Elizabeths continuing transformation into a bad-ass warrior (and even eventually the leader of the pirates  I kid you not) is perhaps the films most unbelievable element  and Im talking about a movie that feature a man with tentacles for a beard. Plus, Knightleys pouty, sour-faced performance continues to betray the conceit of the character; you can never quite figure out why exactly so many of the male characters are in love with this girl (besides her looks of course, but Im trying to give the film some credit and not assume its shallow). Its as if Knightley is in some kind of unspoken competition with Kirsten Dunst to be this summers most allegedly-irresistible-but-in-fact-completely-unlikable movie heroine. As for Blooms Will Turner, he remains one of the blandest movie heroes in recent memory, and even this films reveal, that he is just as willing as the rest of the characters to backstab his friends for his own agenda, does little to change that. I remember hearing talk that the sequels would finally give Bloom something more interesting to do, and make his character more compelling. Turns out this is true, but, unfortunately, by the time this character change happens, and they finally figure out a way to make him interesting, the movie is nearly over. a complete lost cause? Not exactly. There are definitely some fun and unforgettable sequences sprinkled here and there, and I suppose it is kinda nice to finally see the saga achieve a sense of closure (somewhat). Plus, in all honesty, Id be lying if I said I probably wont end up buying this film on DVD someday. I am, after all, a completist, and Id hate to leave the first two films all alone on my shelf. Still, for a series that started so strong, its a shame to have to say that the third, and possibly final, film gets by on simply having a few good moments. Remember when the original film was first announced, and everyone the world over mocked Disney, claiming you cant make a good movie out of a theme park ride? Well, those folks were obviously wrong  you can make at least good movie out of a theme park ride. Its when it comes to extending the story that you obviously run into problems. So, will this be the end of the franchise? There are already conflicting statements from those involved with the series on whether this really is the last film or not. Personally, I would love to see more of Capt. Jack on the big screen, but after Im not too sure I want it to be in more Pirates of the Caribbean films. How about a Hope/Crosby-style road movie, with Jack and Barbossa? Or a movie where Jack is somehow zapped into our own modern times? Even better yet  Capt. Jack in space. Believe me, Id follow this character to the ends of the earth, but after seeing this third, waterlogged entry, I think its time to dry-dock this particular series for good. : To put it politely, Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End is an overindulgent, though mildly entertaining, mess. It's even more bloated and overwhelming than the disappointing , with everything that made the first film so special pushed aside in favor of an unnecessarily elaborate and complex story. And while Johnny Depp remains as amusing as ever, and the return of Geoffrey Rushs Captain Barbossa raises the film a hair above the previous entry, even they can't save the movie from its own confusing mythology. Thanks to Depp, Rush, and a few fun sequences here and there, I wouldnt call it an unwatchable film. But its not all that great, either, and certainly doesnt live up to the promise the franchise originally showed. Lets just file this one under missed opportunity, and hope that if Capt. Jack ever returns to the screen, its in a film more befitting his character.

Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#39;s End sailed to No. 1 at the box office last weekend to the tune of $142 million over four days, and tonight, CBS premieres their newest reality/adventure series, , where eight men and eight women become "modern-day pirates on a high seas adventure" (according to the website) who will "live as buccaneers and travel around the Caribbean island of Dominica in search of hidden treasure that will total $1 million." is the latest creation of Mark Burnett, the producer who gave us , and it will have classic Burnett touches such as a "Pirate&#39;s Court" held at the end of each episode where one unlucky matey will be "cut adrift." The contestants â er, pirates â will undertake weekly "expeditions" (instead of challenges), decipher clues and, of course, engage in mutinous behavior. On the eve of the show&#39;s launch, AfterEllen.com spoke with Jupiter Mendoza, one of 16 contestants â and its only known lesbian. CBS wouldn&#39;t allow us to discuss any of the show&#39;s content before it aired, so Jupiter talked about how she lives as a modern-day pirate, why being a lesbian was not part of her strategy for winning, and why pirates need more bling. AfterEllen.com: How did you hear about the show? I heard about the show through my friend, Courtney [Marit from ] She called me up and said, "This show was made for you." I kind of live my life as a modern-day pirate anyway, and she thought this show would be fantastic for me, and it was. AE: You live your life as a modern-day pirate? What does that mean? Well, sometimes I have to kind of finagle my way through certain situations â¦ and make sure I make money. Also, as a modern-day pirate, I helped build a pirate spaceship. We take [it] out to the desert to Burning Man every year. I consider myself a wench just as much as I consider myself a pirate. AE: Is the pirate/wench thing like a butch/femme thing? I feel like there&#39;s a wench and a pirate. Wenches need to have just as much notice as a pirate. AE: So wenches aren&#39;t getting their due? Is that what you&#39;re saying? I don&#39;t think so. I think they&#39;re not as recognized as much as they should [be]. Wenches usually get the brunt in pirating. AE: Always the plundered, never the plunderer. Yeah. Exactly. But you know, if a pirate is what I need to be, a pirate is what I will be. I&#39;m a pirate and definitely a wench. AE: I know your type. AE: What makes a good pirate? Putting yourself out there, being extremely competitive. You know, no one likes a slacker. You have to put everything in. You have to make sure that you keep your head on your shoulders and watch your back at the same time because, you know, pirates like to lie, cheat and steal. AE: This show is like , but there&#39;s none of that whining, "You promised you&#39;d watch my back" after someone gets burned. A pirate is supposed to be a liar. Absolutely. You know, I think there&#39;s definitely going to be a lot of that. I think a lot of people are saying one thing and really doing something else.

'Pirate Master' hijacks the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' theme and puts a 'Survivor' twist on it. For those not too grog-gy from pirates already, a new reality series washes ashore tonight on the sands of CBS. With "Pirate Master," reality mastermind Mark Burnett hijacks the "Pirates of the Caribbean" theme and puts a "Survivor" twist on it. There are 16 contestants, a million-dollar treasure and the constant possibility of mutiny. "It's a very sexy thing," says "Master" host Cameron Daddo. "We all love freedom. We all love the idea of maybe breaking a few rules and getting away with it. And let's face it, pirates are the original bad boys." Eight men and eight women joined Daddo in the Caribbean around the island of Dominica for 33 days aboard a 179-foot pirate ship. They competed in grueling physical and mental tasks each week to win up to $500,000 in gold coins and the right to be captain. In the finale, the winner will sail away with a lump sum - the other half of the treasure - of $500,000. "Here we are with the same amount of prize money as 'Survivor,'" says Daddo about the program, which airs tonight at 8. "But in our show, that million dollars is spread across four weeks, so everyone has the opportunity to leave with money." "The coins are also a usable commodity after you've won it," says Daddo. "So if a pirate wins, say, $20,000 worth of gold in the first episode, he can use that money to bribe, to win favor or to create a pact with somebody else." Among the contestants living on the high seas are a publicity agent, a beauty queen, a "land pirate" (Laurel, who Daddo says "lives in a van in various parking lots") and ex-NFL player Christian Okoye."He's a definite standout," says Daddo of Okoye. "He's a strong, silent presence on the show." As for Daddo himself, he isn't just another hunky host. He has a looting lineage of his own. "My grandfather told me last year, 'Son, you're a pirate!' He says we were descendants of the Spanish pirates who came down through Cornwall in Ireland." He even has experience uncovering hidden treasure. "I did find a jar full of bullets and a set of false teeth in a dump behind my friend's house. It was treasure to us ... I wear the teeth every day," says Daddo, laughing. CBS hasn't decided whether to do another season of "Pirate Master," but Daddo hopes there's more swashbuckling on the horizon. "There's plenty more treasure out there to be found, that's for sure."

It was auctioned in Christie's auction house in New York last night, and the winning bid came from Newbridge Silverware. It cost $192,000, over six times the guide price expected by Christie's. The iconic dress will go on display in a new style museum in the County Kildare town that is opening tomorrow. The marketing manager for Newbridge Silverware, Phil Donnelly, doesn't think they paid over the odds.

On Tuesday's show, Hasselbeck said she and O'Donnell were "in communication a lot," though Hasselbeck didn't say whether they had talked on the phone or exchanged e-mails. Their confrontation last Wednesday led to O'Donnell's early departure from the daytime chatfest. "This weekend gave us the opportunity to tackle our most important Hot Topic yet, and that was the power of forgiveness, and I believe that we've begun that process," Hasselbeck said. "And so now that enables us to move on in a very positive way. ... I'm really happy about that."

Hasselbeck is trying to patch things up with Rosie O'Donnell, her former co-host on ABC's "The View," after their on-air spat last week. On the show on Tuesday, May 29, 2007, the first live post-O'Donnell edition of "The View," Hasselbeck said she and O'Donnell were "in communication a lot," though Hasselbeck didn't say whether they had talked on the phone or exchanged e-mails. (AP Photo/Diane Bondareff, FILE) (Diane Bondareff - Associated Press) A look at the famous faces making headlines in movies, music and more. Save & Share Article Show creator and co-host Barbara Walters said Tuesday she had been sending e-mails to O'Donnell and they remain "close friends." Walters also said O'Donnell is welcome back to "The View" as a panelist at anytime. The argument between Hasselbeck and O'Donnell began over O'Donnell's earlier statement about the war: "655,000 Iraqi civilians had died. Who are the terrorists?" Talk-show critics accused O'Donnell of calling U.S. troops terrorists. She called Hasselbeck "cowardly" for not saying anything in response to the critics, which set off their lengthy argument. On Friday, ABC said O'Donnell asked for, and received, an early exit from her contract. O'Donnell said last month she would be leaving because she couldn't agree to a new contract with ABC executives. In a video blog posted Saturday on her Web site, O'Donnell said she didn't think she and Hasselbeck would ever speak again. "I haven't spoken to her, and I probably won't, and I think it's just as well," O'Donnell said. "I wrote her an e-mail, and she wrote me back, and there you have it." O'Donnell also said she never really fit in on the show. ABC is a division of The Walt Disney Co.

For the benefit of those who don't recognize the name, Levangie Grazer is the wife of successful film producer Brian Grazer. She knows a little somethin'-somethin' about Hollywood ladies who lunch and fall from grace. Wrote a few books about it, even. Needless to say, a person could not reasonably expect a subject so tempting to remain on bookshelves unmolested for long. "The Starter Wife" came out in 2005; two summers later, USA Network is presenting it as a miniseries. One that proves that some books should never be anything more than books. What's riveting on the page has a tendency to transform into a bore or a mess on screens large or small. Doesn't matter if the novel's pulp or a Pulitzer Prize winner, it can stink either way. (Rent "Beloved." You'll see.) Chick lit like "The Starter Wife" poses a special danger because of its disposability. This is the kind of book meant to be left on airplanes or passed along to friends with the advisement that they don't need to be returned. There was really no need to drag Debra Messing, Joe Mantegna or Judy Davis into that pool. Alas, they're all in, along with Miranda Otto and blatant product placement of Pond's Time Rewind overnight cream -- Pond's being the major sponsor of this six-hour summertime event. A real Starter Wife would rather massage motor oil into her complexion than stoop to using drugstore brands; Crème de la Mer is as downscale as these ladies go. But never mind that. USA's "The Starter Wife" exists to delight women of a certain age, especially those who can relate to Molly Kagan's (Messing) situation. Molly is the perfect wife, attendant to the every need of her studio head husband (Peter Jacobson) until the morning he dumps her over the phone. We all know these things happen and, unlike a commoner's divorce, ends of rich people's marriages tend to be ameliorated by multimillion dollar settlements and endless trips to the spa. What we may not realize is what special hell awaits the less-powerful party in a Hollywood split. Sentencing for the jilted includes waiting forever for tables at the most exclusive restaurants; not being invited to weekend bacchanals at Brangelina's; having your charities dump you and former confidantes with names like Cricket (Otto) shun you. One also is forced to endure the icy glares of daring to exist after divorce makes you irrelevant. Oh, the staring. It's enough to make a woman frost her face with dollops of magical face cream (with dermal-recovery complex!) as if to ward off Molly's tortures. Molly finds respite in her boozy girlfriend Joan's (Davis) impeccably designed Malibu beach pad, and her interior-designer pal Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos) helps pull her through the bleak lonely tunnel on the way to divorce court. It's probably unfair to say that flanking Messing's character with a rich drunkard and a gay husband is a throwback to "Will & Grace" but how can a person not notice? The memory of Karen Walker gives Joan the appeal of a tall glass of bitters. She may be a more honest TV alcoholic, which means she breaks things and suffers consequences, but Karen was loads more fun. Other pick-me-ups include Molly's soon-to-be-ex's business partner Lou (Mantegna), who swoops in at the right moments to remind Molly that she's still a woman, and a handsome mystery dude who spends all of his time on the beach. As it turns out, he's going through a rough spot, too. So is everyone else. All that glitters is not gold, you know. Blather and platitudes brought to life in a cable movie whose insubstantiality grows hour by hour. The essence of chick lit is well covered here -- fabulous woman and friends get toppled by circumstance, tumble down the hill together and land on the solid ground of True Selfhood. The formula for a decent, quick read. Television requires a different mix of stimulants absent in USA's muddled version. A sense of destination, solid plot progression and firmly developed story lines would all be nice. Director Jon Avnet ("Fried Green Tomatoes") should know that by now. But after Molly is dumped for a ditzy Britney-wannabe, the best "The Starter Wife" can do is a chronicle of adjustment to her debased circumstances, inch by inch. A mystery slapped into the story becomes after the fact thanks to a painfully stupid resolution. (And really, exile to Malibu? Certainly not the worst of fates.) A few days is all it takes to plow through Levangie Grazer's book, and it's easy to feel fine about that. Watching six hours of TV spread out over a few weeks is a lot to ask, especially given how disappointing, disorganized and disposable those installments shape up to be. "The Starter Wife" may best be enjoyed under optimal conditions, with the assistance of icy cocktails and the companionship of two or three great friends. That combination makes life's hardest situations bearable. You shouldn't need it to get your kicks out of a summer cable flick. 9 p.m. Thursdays, USA Network 'Wife' week continues with Lifetime's "Army Wives" and BBC America's "Footballers' Wives" P-I TV critic Melanie McFarland can be reached at 206-448-8015 or .

Hasselbeck said Monday on "The View" she and O'Donnell were "in communication a lot," though she didn't say if they spoke on the phone or just e-mailed. O'Donnell had said before she didn't think she and Hasselbeck would ever speak again. Hasselbeck says they tackled the hot topic of "the power of forgiveness." She says they have "begun that process" and that enabled them "to move on in a positive way." said she, too, was e-mailing O'Donnell because she says they remain "close friends." She says O'Donnell is welcome back on "The View" at any time. Earlier, O'Donnell said she might never speak to Hasselbeck again. In a video entry posted on her blog, O'Donnell said Hasselbeck called after their now-infamous argument and spoke to O'Donnell's partner Kelli. But O'Donnell said she didn't speak to Hasselbeck and "probably won't." She said they exchanged e-mails. ABC: Rosie O'Donnell Won't Be Back on 'The View' Click here to view the video blog. O'Donnell quit "The View" after she called Hasselbeck "cowardly" for not defending her when critics said she compared U.S. troops to terrorists. During the argument, the director used a split screen with O'Donnell on one side and Hasselbeck on the other. She said when she saw the split screen that's when she "knew it was over." She has said it made "The View" look like "The Jerry Springer Show." ABC announced Friday O'Donnell would not be back on "The View," two days after she and Hasselbeck argued on air. "We had hoped that Rosie would be with us until the end of her contract three weeks from now, but Rosie has informed us that she would like an early leave. Therefore, we part ways, thank her for her tremendous contribution to 'The View' and wish her well," Brian Frons, the president of Disney-ABC's Daytime Television Group, said in a statement. After a colorful eight months on the show, punctuated by her feud with and frequent flare-ups with the more conservative Hasselbeck, O'Donnell's contract had been set to terminate on June 22. "I brought Rosie to the show. Rosie contributed to one of our most exciting and successful years at 'The View.' I am most appreciative. Our close and affectionate relationship will not change," said Walters. "I'm extremely grateful. It's been an amazing year and I love all three women," O'Donnell said in a statement. O'Donnell, who lifted ratings for the sagging talk show, said last month she would be leaving because she could not agree to a new contract with ABC executives.

The 20-year-old, who was due to begin shooting Poor Things this week, sought treatment after being arrested following a car crash at the weekend. Police said they found a substance thought to be cocaine in her car. Co-star and producer Shirley MacLaine said "in the spirit of helping" Lohan, they were trying to re-arrange filming. "We wish her love and the blending of mind, body and spirit," the statement added. Lohan was arrested on Saturday after her car mounted a kerb on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. She was not charged, but is due to appear in court in August. It is not the first time the star's personal life has caused problems with her film career. Last July, studio executive James G Robinson went public with a letter to Lohan, scolding her for repeatedly showing up late on the set of Georgia Rule. He called her behaviour "discourteous, irresponsible and unprofessional", and cited her "ongoing all-night heavy partying" as the reason for her tardiness. It is the second time the star has checked into rehab this year. She spent a month at the Promises treatment centre in Malibu in January.

Tell a friend by email Tell a friend by AOL Instant Messenger This Ain't No Jive This Ain't No Jive Is Justin Timberlake going out on a limb forming a new label at Interscope, instead of his recording home Jive, or is Interscope taking the real risk by creating a costly new venture in the face of declining record sales? Says JC Chasez: ''&#91;Timberlake's&#93; going to bring a lot of heat, because the world is staring at him right now.'' Justin Timberlake considered partnering with any number of major labels while shopping for a home for his Tennman Records imprint. So why did he ultimately go with Interscope Records and not, for instance, Jive, where Timberlake has been signed as an artist since his teen years in 'Nsync? ''The thing that ultimately made the decision for him,'' Timberlake's longtime manager Johnny Wright explains to EW.com, ''was the labels that &#91;Interscope&#93; already had and the people who were running them. Timbaland has a label there, Pharrell has a label there, will.i.am has a label there. If &#91;Justin has&#93; a synergy with these producers and writers, why not be there?'' (A representative for Jive confirmed that Timberlake is still on their roster but declined further comment.) Still, with profits from CD sales continuing to plummet industry-wide, there are clear risks for any label that decides to launch a costly new project like Tennman. Wright declined to discuss the deal's financial terms, but as one top industry insider comments: ''To be in business with Justin Timberlake, one of the biggest stars in the world, isn't cheap. It puts too much pressure on the deal.'' Tennman president Ken Komisar &#151; former VP of A&R for Sony BMG &#151; concedes that any start-up imprint faces steep challenges, but he believes Timberlake's successful track record as an artist and, more recently, as a writer and producer for other acts, can bring success to the new label. ''Someone who has the creative vision that he has &#151; it doesn't take all the risk away, but it certainly helps to make the odds a little better.'' Former *NSync bandmate JC Chasez, who enlisted Timberlake's production and songwriting skills for several tracks on his forthcoming sophomore album, , points out that Timberlake's status as an international megastar doesn't hurt either. ''Obviously, he's going to bring a lot of heat, because the world is staring at him right now,'' Chasez says. ''He brings free press with him wherever he goes.'' But does the 26 year-old have the business acumen to run a label? Nate ''Danjahandz'' Hills, Timbaland protÃ©gÃ© and co-producer of number-one Timberlake singles ''SexyBack'' and ''My Love,'' says he witnessed the star's marketing savvy first-hand. '' 'SexyBack', he knew it was risky for him,'' Hills says. ''He knew he didn't sound like himself and he'd been gone for a while.'' Nevertheless, Timberlake fought to have the song released as 's first single. As Jive CEO Barry Weiss told EW back in February, ''It was an unusual record, but it was a risk that clearly paid off.'' It remains to be seen whether Timberlake will sign artists that will approach his level of success, and it might be a while before we find out. ''We're in a short-term business right now,'' says the insider. ''He wasn't walking in with an exciting, brand-new artist. It could be another two years before a record comes out &#91;on Tennman&#93;.'' A senior executive at another label is cautiously optimistic about any new venture headed by a recording artist: ''Justin himself is a tremendous musical force, so there's no better person to get in business with. But it's tougher than ever now to break an act. The key ends up being, can he pick and identify great talent? We've all known superstar artists who've gotten labels and not been able to pick talent and others who could.'' Timberlake has yet to announce any signees to Tennman (the name's a nod to his Tennessee roots). Says Wright, ''He just doesn't want artists that are sitting around waiting for Justin to come in and write a song or Justin to tell them what direction to go in. He wants artists that he's proud to do a duet with &#91;or&#93; put on his stage.'' Recent Internet speculation suggests his first artist could be Dutch teen and online sensation magazine reported that Denters' popular YouTube performances had attracted frantic attention from a host of major labels. In her most , Denters covers Timberlake's ''What Goes Around... Comes Around'' &#151; complete with a surprise cameo from Timberlake himself. Though no one in Timberlake's camp would confirm or deny any plans to sign Denters, Wright confirms that the star has talked with the teen and is ''definitely interested'' in working with her. Hills recalls, ''&#91;Justin&#93; was like, `She's crazy! I definitely want to get in the studio.' '' He was just excited about getting in with her and doing some music.'' Adds Komisar: ''&#91;Denters&#93; is hugely talented. We've all seen &#91;her talent&#93; unveil itself on YouTube, and you see the strength and power she has on her own. We'd be very lucky to work with her.'' If Timberlake can bring his Midas touch to Tennman, it's Denters who'd be the lucky one.

House Majority Leader Tom DeLay Indicted Ala. Officials Probe 'Monster Pig' Saga Wednesday, May 30, 2007; 6:42 PM BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- State wildlife officials said Wednesday they want to know how the huge hog dubbed "Monster Pig" got into a fenced hunting preserve where it was chased down and shot to death by an 11-year-old boy. The young hunter is not accused of doing anything illegal, but the head enforcement officer for Alabama's wildlife agency said agents are trying to determine if anyone broke a state law prohibiting the transportation and release of live feral swine. In this photo released by Melynne Stone, Jamison Stone, 11, poses with a wild pig he killed near Delta, Ala., May 3, 2007. Stone's father says the hog weighed a staggering 1,051 pounds and measured 9-feet-4 from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. If claims of the animal's size are true, it would be larger than ``Hogzilla,'' the huge hog killed in Georgia in 2004. (AP Photo/Melynne Stone) (Melynne Stone - AP) In Today's A Section More in Today's Print Edition Save & Share Article "There are some questions about where the animal came from, how he got there, how long he'd been there," said Allan Andress, enforcement chief for the Alabama Wildlife and Freshwater Fisheries Division. Andress said officials also will review whether the hunt complied with the state's "fair chase" law, which requires that prey at hunting plantations have a reasonable chance of escape. Eddy Borden, the owner of the spread where the hunt occurred, declined comment on how the hog got into the 150-acre fenced-in area where it was killed last month by Jamison Stone of Pickensville. Borden said he was getting tired of questions about the hog, which Jamison's father said weighed 1,051 pounds and measured 9 feet, 4 inches from the tip of its snout to the base of its tail. The kill drew international attention. "I didn't ask for the publicity. I just want it to all go away," said Borden, whose Lost Creek Plantation is located in east Alabama. Keith O'Neal, one of the guides who accompanied Jamison and father Mike Stone on the paid hunt, said he was unsure if the super swine was placed in the enclosure or grew up it. Jamison was hunting with his father and the guides on May 3 when he killed the giant pig. He said he shot the huge animal eight times with a .50-caliber revolver and chased it for three hours through hilly woods before finishing it off with a point-blank shot. Mike Stone said neither he nor his son did anything wrong. "It's an 11-year-old boy who went hunting," said Mike Stone. "He was enjoying all the attention at first, but it's all getting old." Andress said there is nothing illegal about a child hunting in Alabama.

The bad news is: That rules out a whole class of easy wiseass putdowns (Shrek the Third is a third as good as the first! The new Pirates of the Caribbean is so bad it makes the last Pirates of the Caribbean look like the first Pirates of the Caribbean!). The medium news is: The new Kevin Costner thriller, Mr. Brooks, while unsatisfying in some ways, is interesting enough that I wont have to use my overworked invective muscle. The film dives right into its central premise with an opening title card of the sort usually saved for epigrams from the Book of Revelation: The hunger has returned to Mr. Brooks brain. It never left really. We meet Earl Brooks (Costner) as he is being honored at a testimonial dinner. This self-made pillar of the community is a wealthy businessman, husband to luscious Emma (Marg Helgenberger), loving father to college girl Jane (Danielle Panabaker, whom I mistook for Amber Tamblyn until the credits rolled), philanthropist, all-around great guy. But even as he is feted by the outside world, he is fetid on the inside. Like so many others, Earl has an addiction problem  except his addiction is to killing. (Together with the upcoming You Kill Me, this is one of two movies this month to show murderers attending AA meetings. Go figure.) Even as hes driving home from the dinner, his control begins to slip. Someone named Marshall (William Hurt) materializes in the back seat of the car and starts goading Earl to have a little fun. Director/co-writer Bruce A. Evans is as unambiguous as possible about Marshall. At his very first appearance, its crystal clear that he couldnt have been hiding in the back; that Emma, in the front passenger seat, cant see him or hear him; and that Emma cant even hear Earls side of the exchange. That is, Marshall definitely exists only in Earls mind. You might argue that hes some sort of possessing demon, but he has no visibility outside of Earls p.o.v. (unlike, to use the most obvious example, the evil spirit BOB in Twin Peaks). Once home, Earl tells Emma he wants to stay up and work, which tonight means murdering someone, aided by his imaginary confidante. But, this time around, Earl and Marshall are a little careless. (Or is some part of Earls psyche trying to get caught?) He is spotted in the house by one of the victims neighbors, an amateur photographer we only know initially as Mr. Smith (Dane Cook). Luckily, Mr. Smith is just as twisted as Earl, and arguably less sympathetic. An obnoxious geek, Smith doesnt give his evidence to the cops, but rather uses it to blackmail Earl into taking him along on his next killing, because, hey, what could be cooler than that? At the same time, police detective Atwood (Demi Moore) is hot on the trail of the perpetrator, while dealing with her own convoluted set of issues. Atwood has an excess of back story  she grew up as a super-rich kid and is still in competition with her intimidating father; shes in the middle of an ugly divorce; and another evil psycho she nailed has just broken out of jail and is looking for payback. The films central idea  Mr. Right being secretly Evil  is not precisely new. In literary terms, the concept goes back to Robert Louis Stevenson; Earl is basically the altogether virtuous Dr. Jekyll, with Marshall his partially released Mr. Hyde. Whats interesting in Evanss approach is the low-key expression of this classic concept. That is, after his delightful over-the-top performance in A History of Violence, one might have expected Hurt to chew the scenery. In fact, he has rarely been more restrained. Costner has always done his most interesting work when he strays furthest from his Jimmy Stewart/Gary Cooper persona. (Note: Im using that as fuzzy shorthand, since, as fans are aware, both of those actors played characters with really disturbing dark sides, particularly Stewart.) In a film like The Postman, Costner seems too protective of his aw-shucks good-guy image; hes much better in Clint Eastwoods A Perfect World, where he isnt straitjacketed in a heroic mode. And in the much-maligned 3000 Miles to Graceland, he plays a downright villain, and he seems to be enjoying it. The fact is, there has always been a neurotic, scary edge to Costner that he generally suppresses. His endearing grin has just a touch of the manic, and hes at his best when he gives it freer rein  which is what he does here. Earl Brooks may be a tragic  or at least sad  figure, but there are moments when Costner gives him a face that is crazier and more wicked than anything we see from Marshall. Also keeping the movie interesting is a truly ugly subcurrent in the story  I cant be explicit without major spoilage  that is only slightly hinted at. Or perhaps its just my David Lynch-soaked mind seeing horror where none is intended. Despite its virtues, Mr. Brooks begins to flag before its two hours are up. Evans and partner Raynold Gideon throw in so much plot that things get muddled. The final working out of all the different threads is downright confusing, smacking of last-minute doctoring or trimming an overlong running time. Speaking of plot confusion  In my sporadic, after-the-fact attempts to figure out just who in Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End, was doing what to whom (and why?) it suddenly occurred to me that this Bloated, Disappointing Third Episode in a Trilogy had amazing similarities to perhaps the all-time champion Bloated, Disappointing Third Episode in a Trilogy. Think about it: The hero is trapped in a mystical, white holding area. Out in the real world, his friends are trying to free him. They need charts or instructions to bridge the gap between the worlds. They boldly show up at the headquarters of a foreign adversary (of dubious reliability), who has what they need, leading to a big fracas. Meanwhile, the film is stretched out to excessive length by endless new plot complications, interminable CGI battles, and more and more supernatural rules that correlate to nothing real but must be accepted just because. Is it Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End? Or is it The Matrix Revolutions? Would anybody consciously choose the Wachowski Brotherss mess as a template to emulate? Perhaps the similarities end there. It would take another viewing of both films to find further common elements. And thats a sacrifice Im not currently willing to make. Mr. Brooks. Directed by Bruce A. Evans. Written by Bruce A. Evans & Raynold Gideon. With Kevin Costner, Demi Moore, Dane Cook, William Hurt, Marg Helgenberger, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and Danielle Panabaker.

Breaking news E-mail alerts Get breaking news in your inbox as it happens Good news at home: Burnett married Roma Downey last month. Burnett sets sail with a TV 'Pirate' By Gary Levin, USA TODAY Mark Burnett, one of reality TV's biggest producers, is having one of the busiest weeks in his career. He's producing Sunday's live , his first awards show. His new CBS series, , a wrinkle on with costumed contestants on a ship, premieres tonight (8 ET/PT). He's recruiting a new crop of 11-year-olds for 32 new episodes of Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (tonight, 8 ET/PT), Fox's spring-hit quiz show, for next season. And last month, he married actress Roma Downey ( Touched By an Angel Yet Burnett, 46, has hit a few speed bumps along the way. His filmmaker competition series, (Monday and Tuesday, 8 ET/PT, Fox), is struggling mightily despite its Steven Spielberg pedigree, a victim of narrow appeal among the competition reality shows that are Burnett's specialty. , the show lost two-thirds of 's audience, and Monday's two-hour episode averaged a measly 2.9 million viewers. Fox is now weighing options such as combining the Monday screening and Tuesday results episodes into a single weekly hour. Also on the ropes: , the Donald Trump-hosted business competition that soared, then sunk in the ratings. NBC declined to renew the show but contractually has until Friday to do so. Burnett says Trump "truly felt disrespected" by the network, but the producer "feels sure" the show will continue on another network if NBC passes. "We've had plenty of discussions." , Burnett was an innovator of the modern-day vote-off reality show, with its ritualistic eviction, moody music and lush cinematography. Other examples: boxing series , dropped by NBC, which plans a third season on ESPN; and , canceled by CBS after two seasons. 's 14th edition, which ended this month, marked its least-watched yet, with 14.2 million viewers. But the show easily wins its Thursday time slot, and it begins filming its next edition soon in China, marking the first major U.S. TV show to be filmed there. Asked about similarities among his shows, Burnett is unapologetic. "It's me! There's a commonality in my company of how we shoot things. If it ends up doing (as well as) , I'll be happy." , which arrives a week after the third Pirates of the Caribbean "It's high adventure that they're on this pirate ship, and there's actual money being discovered in the form of gold every week," as opposed to a single winner-take-all payout, Burnett says. Using maps, 16 contestants compete in physical challenges in search of hidden coins around Dominica, the Caribbean island where the show was filmed. A "captain," elected by the group, takes half of each week's booty and lives large in a fancier cabin with better food and no deck-scrubbing. But "if he doesn't handle it right, if he (ticks) them off, there can be a mutiny." In a reversal of 's captain marks three crewmembers as potential plank-walkers; one is voted off. , Burnett says remaining episodes veer away from the "pitch meetings" that dominated last week's episodes and will focus on the 15 remaining contestants and the short films they'll make with limited resources. Viewers vote for their favorite, and a filmmaker is eliminated each week. "Conceptually, with the prevalence of YouTube, this should do well," he says. "It's not doing as well as we'd hoped."

(CPimages/AP Photo/Disney Enterprises, Stephen Vaughan/HO) Published: Wednesday, May 30, 2007 LOS ANGELES (AP) - "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" ruled the seven seas with a record $139.8 million domestically over the long Memorial Day weekend, lifting its worldwide total to $404 million. The third "Pirates" film starring Johnny Depp as boozy buccaneer Jack Sparrow surpassed the four-day mark of $122.9 million for last year's "X-Men: The Last Stand," the previous record-holder for a Memorial Day weekend. "At World's End" raised its domestic gross to $153 million since debuting with Thursday night preview screenings. Overseas, the movie has added an additional $251 million since the sequel began rolling out overseas last Wednesday. The franchise failed to snatch back the three-day weekend record it lost to this month's "Spider-Man 3," whose $151.1 million debut eclipsed the $135.6 million mark for last summer's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."

A poster of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" BEIJING, May 29 (Xinhuanet) -- A fourth installment of "Shrek" is scheduled to debut in 2010, another ""Spider-Man" sequel is in the works, "Pirates of the Caribbean" is currently smashing worldwide box office records, so what about another dose of "swishbuckling" Jack Sparrow? Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is coy, saying he and his mates need a break. But he already has rights to a book that could end up as another installment. And Johnny Depp hasn't vowed another voyage, but also hasn't said no to playing a character he relishes, telling one interviewer: "As long as you're doing it for the right reasons, why not?" "When these franchises become part of the world's culture, they take on a life of their own," said Dick Cook, Disney's studio chairman, who says he's on board for another "Pirates" if the script is right and the filmmakers are willing. Though Bruckheimer and Disney executives say the "Pirates" trilogy has concluded, they imply the series could continue through a spinoff or prequel. In an interview with an Australian film website, screenwriter Terry Rossio said he and partner Ted Elliott would take a crack at another "Pirates" script and see if they could make it work. In Southern California, moviegoers interviewed were divided on the prospect of a fourth "Pirates" after watching the latest chapter, which clocked in at nearly three hours. Elizabeth Lopez, 24, of Long Beach, suspected the latest "Pirates" might disappoint as the third film in the series. "But it actually was very good," she said. "Yes, I'm hoping they make another one because of the way it ended." But Richard Kirk, 69, of Bellflower, has seen enough. "It just gets rather complicated, especially the first part of it," he said. "I really think they should leave it at three." "Pirates" sure bet to break 4-day holiday record BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhuanet) -- "Spider-Man 3" still holds the three-day box office record of 151 million U.S. dollars, but "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" appears a sure bet to establish a new mark for a four-day holiday opening. "Pirates" should easily break the industry's holiday weekend box-office record of 122.9 million dollars established Memorial Day weekend of last year by "X-Men 3: The Last Stand" and, according to Disney, should also achieve the largest global opening ever. "Pirates 3" fails to set new opening box office mark LOS ANGELES, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The latest film of Walt Disney's "Pirates of the Caribbean" franchise failed to set new opening box office record in North America this weekend, largely due to the lingering popularity of superhero Spider-Man and a computer-generated green ogre named Shrek among moviegoers. But "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" still sold an estimated 126.5 million dollars worth of tickets in the United States and Canada during the three-day period, well on its way to setting a new domestic Memorial Day weekend box office record, distributer Walt Disney Pictures said Sunday. Lengthy "Pirates" leaves viewers at wit's end BEIJING, May 24 (Xinhuanet) -- The critics will criticize it for being too long (almost three hours) and frivilous, but the fans will come when "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" opens Thursday in theaters across America. The movie begins with Elizabeth (Keira Knightley), Will (Orlando Bloom) and Barbossa (Geoffrey Rush) arriving in Singapore to recruit and introduce the episode's major new character, Chinese pirate Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat), to aid in their fight against the evil Lord Beckett (Tom Hollander).

The third instalment in the trilogy, At Worlds End, has taken $401m (297m) worldwide in its first six days of release  - the biggest opening in movie history, according to makers Walt Disney. It surpassed the $382m (283m) set by Spiderman 3 earlier this year. In the UK, the movie raked in £13.4 (19.6m) on its opening weekend  the highest box office of the year. But the critics have been unimpressed by the latest adventure which reunites Johnny Depp, Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley. And the worldwide three-day opening fell short of second film Dead Mans Chest. Mark Zoradi of Disney said: We knew that audiences all over the world were excited to see Johnny Depp and the rest of the fantastic Pirates cast in this latest adventure, but this record-setting response at the global box office has been nothing short of incredible. Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End now has the distinction of having the biggest opening in movie history, and were extremely proud of that achievement. Disney has announced plans for an online Pirates of the Caribbean game which will allow players to create a virtual world set on the high seas. © Thomas Crosbie Media, 2007.

I found myself discussing this tricky aspect of friendship with several people after last week&#0039;s on-air faceoff between It all started when O&#0039;Donnell&#0039;s feelings got hurt over Hasselback&#0039;s failure to defend some inflammatory remarks O&#0039;Donnell made likening U.S. servicemen to terrorists. One thing led to another and before long, there were hard feelings on both sides. Even though the demise of the O&#0039;Donnell-Hasselbeck so-called friendship played itself out in front of a national TV audience, this kind of thing happens all the time. One friend has certain expectations that another fails to live up to. Who&#0039;s right? Who&#0039;s wrong? And afterwards, is such a relationship salvageable? In my opinion, O&#0039;Donnell&#0039;s expectations were more than a little off base, especially considering how often the two clashed on air. "I think there is some truth to the idea that the bully is the most sensitive," said , author of "The Girl&#0039;s Guide to Absolutely Everything" (Workman Publishing, $15.95). "When it comes to our female friends, it&#0039;s usually the ones who put up the steeliest fronts who are the most sensitive in the long run." The remark that set things in motion was O&#0039;Donnell&#0039;s earlier assertion that, "655,000 Iraqi civilians have died. Who are the terrorists?" Critics immediately circled, accused O&#0039;Donnell of labeling American service people as being terrorists. And, for some bizarre reason, O&#0039;Donnell turned on Hasselbeck, calling her non-action "cowardly." Even though she tried to hold her own, as usual, Hasselbeck was no match for the brash, fast-talking O&#0039;Donnell. By the time the dustup was over, the so-called friendship was, too. O&#0039;Donnell now says she&#0039;s filmed her last episode of the show and will leave earlier than her planned mid-June departure because she doesn&#0039;t want to fight with Hasselbeck any more. In a statement, O&#0039;Donnell claimed to "love" her along with all the other co-hosts. Oh, gag me. For starters, who knew these two were even friends? And even if they were friendly socially, the way I see it, O&#0039;Donnell violated one of the first rules in the girlfriend handbook: Just because you work with someone and maybe hang out occasionally, that doesn&#0039;t make her your true, lifelong - nor should you expect someone you barely know to stand up for you on national TV. "I kind of sat there and looked at them and thought, &#0039;What did you expect her to do?&#0039; " agreed , a communications professional based in Philly. "I&#0039;m, like, I didn&#0039;t know you all were friends. You work together. You&#0039;re probably friendly. But I couldn&#0039;t see the two of you going clubbing. I couldn&#0039;t see Elisabeth Hassebeck on one of Rosie&#0039;s lesbian vacations. It was weird." , who graduated from Temple two years ago, agreed. "Why would [Hasselback] defend her? She&#0039;s obviously the complete opposite side of the spectrum. Why would she defend her and ruin her credibility as this nice Republican girl?" The lesson in all of this is: You have to temper your expectations when it comes to friendships. "Rosie had an expectation that her friend should defend her when controversy arises. "Elisabeth didn&#0039;t share that expectation and so she didn&#0039;t leap to Rosie&#0039;s defense," , author of "Friends Are Everything" (Conari, $15.95). "This kind of thing happens all the time between women. One woman has expecations about the role of &#0039;friend&#0039; but never checks to see if her friend shares that same idea about what it means to be a friend. So when her friend fails to behave as she thinks she should, feelings are hurt, and the friendship often ends," Gallagher added. "Rosie was in error in assuming that her friend would defend her, without ever having a conversation about what the two friends expect from each other," she continued. "Rosie needs to learn to fight her own battles, like a big girl, and not expect Elisabeth, , or anyone else to go to bat for her. If Rosie can&#0039;t deal with the consequences of her own statements, she should keep her mouth shut." * Have you peeped a hot trend that hasn&#0039;t been reported?

BY: Actress Archives | Wednesday, May 30, 2007 making headlines for her car crash in Los Angeles over the Memorial Day weekend, one of Hollywood's worst-kept secrets may be headed under the microscope. Underage movie stars seem to have no problems making the rounds at trendy nightclubs on the SunsetStrip and Hollywood Boulevard, but are they being served alcohol? More to the point, after was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence, was served alcohol illegally before her now-infamous car crash? The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control has placed investigators in various nightclubs to try and determine the answer to that question. In the case of , the paparazzi has video showing Lohan leaving the Les Deux Hollywood nightclub at around 3:30am before she crashed her car. In the state of California, the legal drinking age is 21 and alcohol cannot be served after 2 a.m. However, Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore told the had dinner and was not drinking. A statement quoted by the Because of the enormous paparazzi presence outside of Les Deux that night, we allowed her to stay late and wait for her friends. , the 20-year-old star who turns legal age on July 2, was driving her Mercedes-Benz convertible when she hit a curb and crashed into a shrub on Sunset Boulevard. was taken to a nearby hospital in a private car, while the two other passengers in the Mercedes were not hurt. Police later said that they found " a usable amount of cocaine " in the car, and later arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. Since then, a publicist for has said the actress has entered the Promises rehab facility, the same one which recently attended, on Monday. John Carr, a spokesperson for the Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) told the We have a duty to check on these things whenever there's a report of a minor involved in a crash. " Carr also noted that " underage drinking is a huge problem in the state of California. " To support that claim, some statistics claim that 1,574 people were killed in alcohol-related vehicle crashes in 2006, with roughly 200 involved in underage drinking. But the question still remains: Are underage celebrities getting a free pass to drink in Hollywood? Last year, the paparazzi were on the scene at the Mood night club, where various underage stars were seen. Along with and Jesse McCartney were all seen at the nightclub, and all were underage at the time. One photograph showed Jesse McCartney, who was 18 at the time, drinking from a Corona bottle at Mood. However, John Carr told the that, ",eM>We can't prove what's in the glass or where they were. We need a witness on the ground. " The ABC is currently seeking a 15-closure of Mood based on an undercover investigation. John Carr did say that there is no current investigation into Les Deux following the car crash involving , but he did tell the We do investigate any time we get complaints when someone underage is being served. Anyone under the age of 21 cannot be sold alcohol in California.

Arrre you landlubbers ready for a pirate adventure? "Pirate Master," a new reality TV show, places 16 treasure-seekers aboard a 179-foot pirate ship for 33 days in the waters around the Caribbean island of Dominica. Only one aspiring buccaneer will claim the title of "Pirate Master" and the ultimate booty -- $500,000. Keep your eye on the cast: Pensacola native Sean Twomey, 27, will be among the leather-clad crew. The aspiring actor and self-described "nomad" was born here in 1979. His military family made several moves soon after, but at age 11, they returned to Pensacola, where Twomey attended St. John Catholic School for three years. These days, Twomey lives in Venice, Calif., where he tends bar when he isn't surfing or going on auditions. He never imagined those auditions would include "Pirate Master." "It's ironic, because I despised reality TV," said Twomey, who learned about the show online. "Once I got the ball rolling on 'Pirates,' I started studying reality shows like 'Survivor,' and they were addictive." Twomey also "beefed up on pirate lore," reading as many pirate books as he could get his hands on and watching pirate-themed National Geographic and History Channel programs. "Historically, they were not pretty boys like Johnny Depp," he said, referring to Depp's turn as Captain Jack Sparrow in the popular "Pirates of the Caribbean" movie franchise. "Pirates were pretty disgusting people, not like today's kind of Peter Pan idea of what they were. They were men who abandoned their governments and went against the grain." Twomey, going into "Pirate Master," felt his lifelong love of the sea gave him an advantage over some of his land-locked castmates. "My dad, who was in the Navy, brought me up on boats. He was also intent on teaching me to swim very early, so I've had a lot of experience in the water," he said. The affable actor couldn't reveal any eye-patched plot twists or clues from the show, other than, "I thought there would be a lot of 'X marks the spot,' and there was," so local fans will have to watch to see if Twomey makes off with the loot. "Pirate Master" premieres at 7 p.m. today on WKRG-TV, Channel 5, CBS.

Online reports. This news comes less than a week after the 20-year-old pop/movie star had quite an eventful weekend in which she crashed her car, was arrested for drunk driving and is subject to a furthered investigation after police officers found drugs in her car. Lohan reportedly checked into a rehab center on Monday, which will be her second attempt at kicking the can so to speak. âI spoke to the people treating Lindsay, because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care,â Michael Lohan told E! Online. âAnd Iâm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things. Thatâs a very important step.â Before entering into rehab, Lohan was scheduled to begin working on Poor Things, a comedy featuring Shirley MacLaine, who is also the producer for the movie. âWe are trying to rearrange the shooting schedule to facilitate her working at the end of the shoot to coincide with the completion of her rehabilitation,â MacLaine said.

Adriano De Souza returned to the stand in Spector's murder trial a day after telling the jury how he heard a "pow" as he waited outside Spector's castle-like home on Feb. 3, 2003. He said Spector emerged with a gun in hand and said, "I think I killed somebody." Prosecutor Alan Jackson showed the jury photographs of Lana Clarkson's body slumped in a chair in the foyer and close-up of her face with blood around her mouth. The defense claims she shot herself. De Souza said he saw Clarkson's body slumped in a chair with her legs near the floor and asked Spector what happened, to which Spector responded with a shrug. "I didn't know what to do," De Souza testified. "I tried to escape from that place. ... He could shoot me." De Souza said he started to run, then remembered the car and drove outside of the gate. He said he used his cell phone to call Spector's secretary, where he left a message, then called 911. "I think my boss killed somebody," he told one operator in a tape of the call played in court. Asked why he thought that, he stammered, "Because ... he, he have a lady on the, on the floor and he have a gun in, in his hand." He was transferred to a police department and had a conversation with an officer while waiting for authorities to arrive. He spoke of his fear during the conversation, saying, "I'm not inside anymore. I'm afraid to go inside," to which the officer responded, "I don't want you to, OK?" De Souza said he called the secretary first to get Spector's exact street address, and he stopped outside the estate's gate because the address was on a sign there. De Souza, an immigrant from Brazil whose native language is Portuguese, speaks in accented English and the defense has questioned how well he understood Spector. Initial cross-examination by the defense focused on his English education and immigration status. De Souza told the prosecutor he clearly understood Spector. On Tuesday, De Souza described driving Spector and Clarkson from the House of Blues to the producer's house. Clarkson was reluctant, but agreed to join Spector for one drink, De Souza said. Spector rose to fame in the 1960s and '70s, changing rock music with what became known as the "Wall of Sound" recording technique. Clarkson was best known for a role in the 1985 film "Barbarian Queen." . All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

You would? Well that&#39;s great because by 2009 the world&#39;s first Harry Potter theme park will open in Orlando, Florida. The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter - we&#39;re not making this up, promise - is a joint creation of Warner Bros Entertainment and Universal Orlando Resort, and promises to provide Harry Potter fans with "an immersive Harry Potter themed environment." It&#39;s unclear what form The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter theme park will take, although it&#39;s expected that at 12pm, 3pm and 6pm daily, there&#39;ll be some sort of parade where rolls about cackling on top of a solid gold limo with her pockets stuffed with money, jewels and priceless pieces of art that she&#39;ll use to light her cigars with. Hands up, who really thought that this summer would be the last you&#39;d ever hear of anything to do with Harry Potter? Sure, the final Harry Potter book Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows is being published in a matter of weeks, right after the fifth Harry Potter movie Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix is released, but then that&#39;d be it, right? The remaining two Harry Potter movies would come out to muted reaction and everyone would forget about Harry Potter forever. Not a chance. Perhaps realising that she won&#39;t make any money from whining about skinny girls on her website , Harry Potter creator JK Rowling has given the go-ahead for The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter theme park to open in Florida in 2009. But JK Rowling hasn&#39;t just allowed the Harry Potter theme park to be built just for her own money-making gains; no, JK Rowling is also doing it for the fans - specifically the Harry Potter fans who don&#39;t want to travel to different shops to be able to buy every single piece of shamelessly cash-in Harry Potter tat merchandise that&#39;s ever been made. But according to Warner Bros chairman , chairman and CEO of Warner Bros. Entertainment, kids have been crying out for a Harry Potter theme park for years. He told "Over the years we&#39;ve received thousands of letters from fans around the world wishing they could visit Hogwarts (School) and the wonderful locations described in each of J.K. Rowling&#39;s beloved stories." Actually, we&#39;ve got no reason to be cynical about The Wizarding World Of Harry Potter theme park at all. Not only will it bring Harry Potter&#39;s universe to live for millions of his fans, but it&#39;s also bound to be somewhere that can work when the acting thing inevitably dries up. In fact we might even pay the Harry Potter theme park a visit when it opens - so long as there&#39;s a ride that lets us get naked and stab horses in the eyes with a metal stick. But then we said the same thing about , too, and that didn&#39;t stop from calling the police when we got our stabbing stick out.

http://www.mercurynews.com/columns/ci_6026681&cid San Jose Mercury News - McCollum: `Starter Wife' is the perfect summertime fluff san jose / valley start / stop paper (From the last 24 hours) Prosecutors: Aptos woman lived high life on &#36;1.5 million stolen... ACLU targets planner of so-called CIA torture flights Kawakami: Bryant reveals a tortured soul Spector defense targets forensic errors Rivals Steve Jobs, Bill Gates talk like old pals McCollum: `Starter Wife' is the perfect summertime fluff Article Launched: 05/31/2007 01:33:26 AM PDT When it came out in May 2005, Gigi Levangie Grazer's made a splash as the consummate beach book. A Hollywood roman a(gra) clef, it had all the right stuff for summer success: It was fluffy, unchallenging, sexy, glitzy and eminently readable. Now, cable's USA has turned "Starter Wife" into the television equivalent of beach lit. The six-hour miniseries, which begins at 9 tonight, is fluffy, unchallenging, sexy (in a basic-cable way), glitzy and so eminently watchable (and well-made) that it transcends the concept of guilty pleasure. While some of the book's details have been altered in the transition to TV, the key elements remain the same. Molly (Debra Messing) is the 40-ish wife of film studio executive Kenny Kagan (Peter Jacobson in one of the most thankless roles of the season), who dumps her in favor of a Britney Spears-esque pop singer. All of a sudden, Molly's good life - the fab lunches, premieres and parties - is gone, and she is a social outcast in that peculiar, status-driven world known as Hollywood. Molly does have some support. There's gay designer Rodney (Chris Diamantopoulos, Jason Barone on "The Sopranos") and best friend Joan (Judy Davis of "Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows," in a scenery-chewing performance of epic proportions), who loans her a house in the Malibu Colony while Joan herself is off in rehab. A security guard at the Colony (Anika Noni Rose of "Dreamgirls") provides some grounded perspective on Molly's problems, while her soon-to-be ex-husband's boss - studio head Lou Manahan (Joe Mantegna) - and local beach boy Sam (Stephen Moyer of "Uprising") provide a little male companionship along the way. It's all pretty lightweight stuff, and it's unlikely you're going to be moved by Molly's anguish over being bounced from the A list. But much of the dialogue, by writers Sara Parriott and Josann McGibbon ("Runaway Bride"), is smart, sassy and knowing, and director Jon Avnet ("Boomtown") has given the miniseries a bright, snappy look. But the best part of "Starter Wife" is a very engaging performance by Messing, who drops all her "Will & Grace" tics and tricks in favor of a more natural acting style. She's utterly charming, particularly when matched up with Mantegna, who provides some dramatic oomph. At six hours, "Starter Wife" is hardly a "quick read," and there are some rough patches along the way. But it's a perfectly fine summer diversion, and that's OK. (10 p.m. Sunday) falls into another literary genre: chick-lit. A cross between "Desperate Housewives" and the home front part of CBS's "The Unit," it feels like something that would have fit nicely into ABC's lineup of female-skewing dramas. Based on Tanya Biank's "Under Sabres: The Unwritten Code of Army Wives," the series is a prime-time soap that just happens to be set on a military base. Four wives with more than a few marital problems and lot of those pesky secrets provide the focal point, while lovers, husbands and other strangers swirl around the fringes. While lacking the satirical humor of "Housewives" and the edge of "Unit," the show is serviceable in its storytelling, quite well-done in its production and better than well-done in its acting. Kim Delaney ("NYPD Blue") is more on her game than she has been in quite some time as the wife of a ranking officer; Brigid Brannagh ("Over There") is engaging as an ex-cop turned Army spouse; and stage actress Sally Pressman gives a sharp and spunky performance as a bartender who gets a quickie marriage to a young soldier. Lifetime is in the process of trying to upgrade the quality of its original series - it has two more debuting this summer - and "Army Wives" isn't a bad start. I suppose it was inevitable that TV eventually would jump on the "Pirates of the Caribbean" ship and give us a television version of the pirate's life. (8 tonight, Chs. 5, 46) is produced by Mark Burnett of "Survivor" and is basically that show set on pirate ship. There are 16 contestants going through 33 days of elimination challenges to try for the big booty of &#36;1 million. Sound familiar&#63; Arrr! Now that NBC renewed despite low viewership for its first season, the network is re-airing episodes of this marvelous drama on Sundays (9 p.m., Chs. 8, 11). This week's is one of the series' better installments, as star running back Smash Williams (Gaius Charles) gets involved with performance-enhancing drugs, and Tim Riggins (a very good Taylor Kitsch) and Lyla Garrity (Minka Kelly) start their rather messy affair.

Rowling has given her blessing to a US theme park based on the hugely popular schoolboy wizard, to be built in Florida, the people behind it said on Thursday. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter is expected to open in Orlando in late 2009, as a joint venture between Warner Bros Entertainment &#8212; producers of the Harry Potter films &#8212; and Universal Orlando Resort. "The plans I've seen look incredibly exciting, and I don't think fans of the books or films will be disappointed," she said, according to a statement received in London. The park will include rides and attractions featuring the key locations and figures from the best-selling books, including Hogwarts school and the village of Hogsmeade. The Times newspaper reported that the project could cost an estimated $1-billion. Warner Bros boss Barry Meyer said: "Over the years we've received thousands of letters from fans around the world wishing they could visit Hogwarts and the wonderful locations described in each of J.K Rowling's beloved stories." Production designer Stuart Craig, who worked on the blockbuster Potter films and who is helping the theme park project, said visitors would not be disappointed. "Our primary goal is to make sure this experience is an authentic extension of Harry Potter's world as it is portrayed in the books and films," he said. The seventh and last Potter book, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows" is to be published in July, capping a series that has sold 325 million copies worldwide and has been translated into 64 languages. The books have made Rowling an estimated $1-billion richer. The first volume appeared in 1997. Those involved in the printing of the new book have been asked to keep its plot a watertight secret until July 21, when the English version makes its debut.

The deal, which was announced yesterday, , includes a wide range of songs, among them classics like &#8220;That&#8217;s Amore&#8221; and &#8220;Moon River&#8221; and newer hits by songwriters including Linda Perry and Akon. The Famous catalog, which dates to 1928, also includes a catalog of film scores, like the themes from &#8220;The Godfather&#8221; and &#8220;Beverly Hills Cop.&#8221; Viacom took over the business as part of its acquisition of the Paramount movie studio. The agreement comes after an extensive auction that in addition to Sony/ATV attracted suitors including private equity investors and the Universal Music Group, according to executives briefed on the negotiations. Sony/ATV is a partnership of and the pop star Michael Jackson, who had long financed his extravagant lifestyle with loans tied to his share of the venture. Viacom, which operates cable channels like MTV, auctioned the Famous catalog after concluding it was not a core asset. Sony, though, has been seeking publishing catalogs, which generate income when their songs are used by others. In April, Sony said it had acquired the music of the songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller, including &#8220;Hound Dog,&#8221; and &#8220;Love Potion No. 9,&#8221; in a deal valued at roughly $40 million, according to executives briefed on the deal. The company also brought in Martin Bandier, the former chairman of EMI&#8217;s giant publishing unit, as chief executive.

Reilly, one of the few openly gay performers of his generation, died of complications from pneumonia at a Los Angeles hospital overnight on Friday, Dawn Altyn, a spokeswoman for the actor's one-man show said. Reilly's health had been declining for about a year, Altyn said. He was 76. He last performed his autobiographical show, "Save It For the Stage: The Life of Reilly" in 2004, and a filmed version of the show is due to be released to theaters in October. Reilly won a Tony Award in 1962 for his role in "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" and was nominated again in 1964 for "Hello, Dolly!" and in 1997 for directing "The Gin Game." He also received multiple Emmy Award nominations over his five-decade television career, but it was his lengthy turn as a game show panelist on "The Match Game" and "Hollywood Squares" that made him a pop culture fixture. The bespectacled, pipe-smoking actor cruised the edge of 1970s TV propriety with his double-entendres about his openly gay persona. He later speculated that being a game show panelist had hurt his acting career. He also was known for his roles in the 1970s in two children's programs, "Lidsville" and "Uncle Croc's Block" and the TV series "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir." In the early 1990s, he directed several episodes of the TV series "Evening Shade," and in the past few years performed the voice of The Dirty Bubble for the hit cartoon series "SpongeBob SquarePants." The Bronx-born Reilly is survived by his longtime partner, Patrick Hughes. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved. Editors Choice: Best pictures from the last 24 hours.

Having been swallowed by a sea monster in the last one, Captain Jack Sparrow is dead, or at least in Davy Jones' locker which is actually a vast salt desert where, despite being dead, he gets to kill several hallucinated versions of himself aboard his beached ship, before a mass of crabs transports the vessel to the coast for a rendezvous with the rest of the cast who have survived sailing over the edge of the earth into this nautical netherworld. Now Captain Barbossa, Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann need to rescue Sparrow because there needs to be a meeting of the Nine Lords of the Brethren Court - a pirates' steering committee if you will - which has been called after an excursion to Singapore to consult Chinese captain Sao Feng (Chow Yun-Fat) who may or may not be as evil as his beard and scars suggest. With you so far ... Meanwhile, the calamari-faced Davy Jones and the rest of his brutally ugly aquarium has joined forces with the British to hunt down Sparrow, Barbossa and co because they have his still beating heart in a box. Now you're lost me ... actually no, I take that back. I was confused with the multiple Johnny Depps before. And now it's already an hour into the movie and this really isn't going anywhere is it? And then just about everybody changes sides. Or the characters who are meant to be dead spring back to life. Or vice versa. Or turn into a giant pirate goddess with a silly name. And that's not forgetting the really long, very dull meeting of pirates from all parts of the world trying to explain what the plan is for the next hour or so of his nearly three-hour movie. It's at this point Keith Richards delivers his much anticipated cameo as Sparrow's dad. He might give Jones' fishy mob a run for their doubloons in the ugly mug department. But you can't help but think you were the inspiration for him? And then comes the big sea battle. Or is it battles? There is one where two ships are firing at each other from either side of a giant whirlpool which is one way to speed things up. The biggest Brit ship in the battle is called "Endeavour" (which, I think entitles those in this part of the world to a 50c discount for historical insult). But, like so much of the rest of the action in the third Pirates of the Caribbean film, it just reminds you how incoherent it all is. It's not that the story's too complicated. It's that it's not a story but a bunch of leftover ideas from the other films lashed together. After the charming opening chapter of 2004, the previous instalment, Dead Man's Chest, piled on an excess of everything except narrative clarity and convincing performances. But it was restrained compared to At World's End, and its story which constantly defies even of the logic of the semi-mythical world it first created out of a Disney theme park ride, while its characters spend most of its duration shouting at each other in piratese.

Diabolical. Bound-for-hell cruel. Oh, sure, in the past we gave the challenge of starting or ending with a particular line, or including seven specific words in a story. We&#39;ve limited you to 200 words. This year, in addition to the relatively mundane prompts of a photograph and a fortune cookie, we devised what we called the " challenge," in which authors could not use the letters R, S, T, L, N, and E. As you&#39;ll see from the winners and other selected entries, that nasty constraint gave us our most creative and playful entries. Sensitivity Beyond Celebrity: "Dennis Kendall Hall: Four Decades in Photography," at Leger Gallery Written by Steve Banks Wednesday, 30 May 2007 While Dennis Kendall Hall&#39;s work captures numerous famous people and aspects of pop culture, it would be inappropriate to think of his work within the confines of Warhol-ian Pop Art. Andy Warhol focused on celebrity, persona, packaging, façades, and mass production. Hall&#39;s work has a sensitivity that more frequently captures the beautiful and eccentric personalities of the "real" world instead of the glossy unreality of the "glamorous." Get Off the Horse and Pick Up a Shovel: Jay Berkow Finds the Reality in Circa 21s "Oklahoma!" Written by Mike Schulz Wednesday, 30 May 2007 As the director of music theatre performance at Western Michigan University, Jay Berkow is well aware of the historical significance of which he is currently directing for the Circa &#39;21 Dinner Playhouse. "It is kind of the grandfather, or the progenitor, of the contemporary musical-theatre piece," Berkow says, referencing the work&#39;s fame as one of the first "book musicals" in American theatre, wherein songs are fully integrated into the drama, and the lyrics and score are as essential to character understanding as dialogue. No Concern for Whats Next: Great American Taxi, June 5 at RIBCO Written by Jeff Ignatius Wednesday, 30 May 2007 Fans of the self-described "polyethnic Cajun slamgrass" band Leftover Salmon have reason to rejoice this summer, as the outfit is reuniting for a few festival dates in July. But washboard player, vocalist, and guitarist Vince Herman said those shows aren&#39;t a sign that the band is back together. His priorities are elsewhere. My Eyes Are On the Sparrow: "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" Written by Mike Schulz Wednesday, 30 May 2007 Roughly 30 minutes into Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#39;s End , Johnny Depp&#39;s Captain Jack Sparrow makes an entrance that perhaps only Johnny Depp, being directed by Gore Verbinski, would be permitted to make: All we see is Depp&#39;s nose, in enormous close-up, as it hungrily sniffs out a peanut. Eventually we&#39;re treated to a full view of the sloshed swashbuckler we&#39;ve been waiting a half hour to see, yet before Sparrow can pop the peanut in his mouth, he&#39;s shot dead. By Johnny Depp&#39;s Captain Jack Sparrow. Respect for Human Ignorance Written by Andy Hahn Thursday, 24 May 2007 There are some things I would like to add to and comment upon in Jay Lehr&#39;s guest commentary from the May 23 . I&#39;ll start by simply saying that it&#39;s hard to respond to the specific points he brings up in the first half of his article relating to the effects of cranberries, trans fats, DDT, Freon, and others since he simply presents a list of these environmental and health fears and claims they are unfounded without giving any specific reasons why. Dr. Lehr simply lists them all, each with a sentence, and tells us they were all wrong without taking into account any sort of research people have spent their lives working on in these areas.  From the lack of recognition given to such work, it seems as though Dr. Lehr is implying: "What you have said and done was a waste of time; you are simply wrong." Then to tie everything together by a sort of analogy, all environmental and health scares which Dr. Lehr can remember, which we would assume to be many on account of Dr. Lehr&#39;s position as a science director, have never "proved to be true." Voters Support Tax-Swap Idea Written by Rich Miller Wednesday, 30 May 2007 Governor Rod Blagojevich has flatly ruled out an income- or sales-tax hike in exchange for a property-tax cut and more money for education. House Speaker Michael Madigan has said that there isn&#39;t sufficient support in his Democratic caucus to pass an income- or sales-tax hike.

Well, here&rsquo;s the rub: expect more. The producer Jerry Bruckheimer recently said that there was life in the tired trilogy yet, even without Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow. &ldquo;This is the end [of the trilogy], but whether one of the characters or a couple of the characters continue on, it&rsquo;s a possibility,&rdquo; said the Top Gunproducer. &ldquo;Certainly, in a moment at the end of the film there is a hope that something else might happen.&rdquo; Surely some mistake? Already, fourth, fifth and sixth Pirates movies seem an inevitability. And, while the money rolls in &ndash; Pirates 3, currently showing in 102 countries, earned &pound;63.2 million over its opening three days &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy to see Disney&rsquo;s logic. That said, the patience of parents everywhere is wearing thin. Blockbusters, like lawn dogs in the summer, are getting worryingly obese. The recent Spider-Man 3, complete with twists and turns and multiple endings, clocked in at two hours and 20 minutes. Perhaps it&rsquo;s time to reboot the thinking behind blockbuster franchises. Back in 1999, Toy Story, one of the the most successful films, clocked in at only 81 minutes. And the sequel, Toy Story 2? Just 91 minutes. Sometimes, just sometimes, less is undoubtedly more. * Town / City Save to my times One last drop in the Ocean?

There you are, adrift on the choppy seas, trying to keep down the bowl of gruel you choked back for lunch. To your left, rumpled rogues in their sun-bleached tricorns and tattered Elizabethan frills. To your right, mumbling reprobates, each one smellier and less toothy than the next. While deciphering cryptic maps to the buried treasure, you want to scratch your head. But you can't because your hand is a hook. Then there's the damn ship, which always needs work. And the captain, an unintelligible tyrant even when he's not sauced on grog. To top it off, you misplaced your eyepatch during the last plunder. The last lady who made your acquaintance had scurvy. And after the banana incident, now even the monkey hates your guts. Heavenly freedom? More like a living hell. So leave it to Mark Burnett &ndash; the wily buccaneer of network television who remains in constant search of prime-time booty &ndash; to burnish this pirate mythology, attach a &#34;reality&#34; mast and sail it into our living rooms this summer. (CBS, CTV, 8 tonight) is essentially on a barque. That is, 16 contestants are garbed in period costumes, tossed into longboats and encouraged to row toward a 179-foot ship, their home for 33 days. These poor idiots &ndash; sorry, &#34;modern day pirates&#34; &ndash; will drift near Dominica, in the Caribbean, searching for hidden loot. They'll also backstab, butt heads and throw elbows during story arcs inflamed with interpersonal conflict, the hallmark of Burnett Productions. &#34;This is really a step back in history where 16 lucky Americans get to live as pirates &ndash; Arrr!&#34; says Burnett, sounding more like Jonny Quest than Johnny Depp. As per usual, the motivating factor in this manufactured lunacy is the promise of riches; during the &#34;expeditions,&#34; contestants will search for chests of gold coin. Meaning, instead of a $1 million jackpot during a finale few may watch &ndash; Burnett's is quickly becoming a small-screen bomb &ndash; the rewards will be doled out weekly. The contestants will also elect a captain, unaware this will immediately create a caste system on the barque. The captain, you see, will get most of the treasure. And he/she will select two officers. These three will live in relative luxury. Everybody else will be relegated to servant status. As Burnett explained in one preview: &#34;What makes this series really pop is the democracy element on the ship.&#34; What does that mean? It means Burnett is basically plagiarizing himself. Because, again, the parallels between are painfully obvious, starting with the alliances, deals and ever present threat of mutiny. Instead of Tribal Council, there'll be a Pirate's Court. Instead of an extinguished torch there'll be a metaphorical walking of the plank. And instead of Jeff Probst, there'll be Cameron Daddo, a host who makes up for his lack of dimples with foreign-born optimism: &#34;What's going to suck people in about this show is the romance of the sea!&#34; Pirates have always held certain sway within popular culture, from The Pirates of Penzance to Disney's wildly successful Pirates of the Caribbean That franchise, based on a theme-park ride, has triggered more drooling in Hollywood than a T-bone steak inside a dog pound. So you can see why Burnett and CBS have high hopes for this high seas project. The key to its success will be a strong start, beginning with tonight's premiere. Because if viewers miss the boat, they probably won't be inclined to catch up with these pirates. Conrad Black on trial Great home delivery subscription deals here!

I absolutely refuse to throw in the towel. OK, you have every right to ask: What towel? Call me foolhardy, call me naive, but I still believe that the romantic movie comedy is not dead or even dying. However, after watching "Knocked Up," I have every right to believe that it's on life support. I will admit to laughing at some of the jokes in the film. There are some funny lines, many of them spoken with a deliciously jaundiced attitude. But I can honestly state that I did not laugh at the gags that were crude, vulgar and, yes, even obscene. I'm no prude and I've seen thousands of movies, many of which were awful. But there's something about taking a genre -- the romantic fable -- and turning it into sludge that really riles me. Some background is in order. There's a gang of writers and actors in Hollywood that personify the frat-boy mentality. Whether any of them were actually in fraternities, I don't know. These men who refuse to grow up gave us "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," some other movie efforts and a few television shows. The primary male behind the aforementioned film is writer-director Judd Apatow. He was lucky to have Steve Carell in that feature, because the actor brought not only his wry way of speaking but also his deadpan looks. Apatow has now written and directed "Knocked Up," and somewhere along the line he's confused himself with the directing legends of movie comedy -- Billy Wilder, Preston Sturges, Frank Capra, to name but three. Apatow is no genius. He has a way with filth, and that's not anything for which to be grateful. You have every right to ask why I thought the lowbrow "Borat" was brilliant and the movie under discussion is not. That's because "Borat" wasn't presented as something it isn't. The comedy was character-driven. In Apatow's world, the comedy relies on lewd language, a twisted obsession with women's breasts (referred to throughout as "boobs") and a distorted view of male bonding. Does Apatow actually have so low an opinion of friendship that he believes men can only relate to each other by commenting on flatulence, gynecological implements and scoring with hot chicks? These are losers, any way you cut it. And why do we have to spend more than two hours watching a pack of losers, none of whom we'd want as friends? The movie is demeaning not only to women, but also to men. "Knocked Up" wants to think it's a romantic comedy, even while it subverts the formula. Yes, you absolutely can have fun with the genre, but you can't turn it into a cesspool and pretend you're making something worthwhile. This is not a movie for children, nor is it for teenagers under 17. I don't even think Chris Rock has used the "F" word as much as it's spoken in this misfire. To top it off, we have to watch an "actor," and I use the word loosely, named Seth Rogen, who, as Ben, is every annoying slob who ever ate an entire bucket of chicken wings and asked for more. You've seen these guys; you know these guys. Television has prepared us for the overweight, marginally employed bum who's married to a truly beautiful woman, but should people really pay to see a T-shirt-wearing jerk act as if he actually cares about being a father? Rogen is such a bad performer that he can't carry it off. Here's the story: Ben beds Alison, a stunning blonde, played by Katherine Heigl, an actress I like. The two are both drunk, and soon graphic on-screen sex ensues. If I were a woman and this pig were lying on top of me, I'd vomit. But Apatow has her boozed up and not thinking clearly, which is an understatement. What about condoms, you ask? There is some comic by-play about the condom, but if one is used, there is no movie. Alison ends up pregnant. Her character works in television, and having a baby is definitely going to cramp her style. But her real crisis is not so much having the baby but having it with Ben around for the maternity ride. He suddenly becomes a different Ben -- Dr. Benjamin Spock -- and I guess we're supposed to care that he's so nurturing. It's a false sincerity. The impending baby is the only thing that gives his life meaning. Thus Alison is facing a life with two babies, one of whom is an adult who doesn't seem to understand that promising to change diapers isn't a monumental decision. A job would be nice. Alison has a married sister (an uninteresting Leslie Mann) who provides loads of advice. Paul Rudd is her husband, and you're relieved that he and Heigl are in the film. They give the goings-on a professional sheen that's sorely lacking. Ben is surrounded by a raunchy, annoying Greek chorus of male friends, each more boob-obsessed than the next. "Knocked Up" is an ode to laziness that runs on longer than is tolerable. It's clear that Apatow had no ending, so he kept adding extraneous scenes in hopes that one would click. The one he chose doesn't really click. If you go, enjoy the pop culture references and the work from Heigl and Rudd. Just be prepared for filthy dialogue that wants to be taken seriously. The female point-of-view isn't given intelligent -- or even comic -- consideration. At least Apatow doesn't think he's doing satire. Sadly, it seems as if he really believes in the drivel he's delivering. E-mail Michael Calleri at

Chicago Woman Gets Richest Divorce Settlement Ever $184 Million Awarded To Energy Magnate's Wife POSTED: 3:21 pm CDT June 4, 2007 Sign Up for Breaking News Alerts A Chicago woman was awarded $184 million Monday in what could be the richest divorce verdict in U.S. history. At the center of the legal dispute is energy magnate Michael Polsky and his wife of 31 years Maya Polsky. A Cook County judge awarded Maya Polsky $176 million in cash and assets in October. The figure represents half of the couple's estate. On Monday, the judge amended the figure to nearly $184 million because previously omitted assets increased the overall value of the estate. Maya Polsky's lawyers said she was her husband's confidant and should be considered a partner in his success. If it stands, the award would be a record in Illinois. The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers says it knows of no bigger award nationally. Michael Polsky's attorney said he plans to appeal the ruling. . All rights reserved.

"The book opens on my first day on ," she said. "It's been an interesting year. We had to change the epilogue." She was referring to her early departure from the talk show after a blowup with co-host Elisabeth Hasselbeck. The title describes O'Donnell's attempt to leave fame behind after she left her own talk show in 2002. O'Donnell said the book asks: "If celebrity and fame are truly a drug, can one go back to drinking and sip instead of taking a slug?"

Having acquired no less than $400 million in funding, the publisher currently has 12 games in development with another 40 already scheduled. The first two games, based on the "300" movie (different from Eidos' PSP-only game) and the "Saw" film series. Brash will transform the way great film creativity is brought to life in games. Brash&#8217;s innovative business model relies on matching each licensed project with the skills of the best independent development studios, top writers and creative talent. This collaboration is guided by an internal team of experienced producers, under the leadership of video game industry veterans. Brash currently has more than 40 licenses through partnerships with five major film studios, and twelve games in production. &#8220;Brash is founded on the simple premise that top Hollywood creativity plus top game talent should equal great games,&#8221; said Brash Co-Founder, Chairman, and CEO Mitch Davis. &#8220;We are laser focused on delivering high-quality games. The other aspects of our business are left to the experts&#8212; best of breed partners we&#8217;ve tapped for their specific expertise.&#8221; Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group, the world&#8217;s leading distributor of home entertainment, will act as the distribution arm for Brash&#8217;s video games, mobilizing its dedicated sales force and capitalizing on the opportunities created by each film&#8217;s theatrical and DVD releases to achieve dramatic global impact. &#8220;We are very excited about working with Brash as they grow into a major force in the gaming space," said Kevin Tsujihara, President, Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group. &#8220;We believe that our global game distribution services fit perfectly with the Brash strategic mission.&#8221; Brash was founded by Mitch Davis, Nicholas Longano, Thomas Tull and Bert Ellis. Brash Chairman and CEO Davis and President and COO Longano are most recently known for developing the world&#8217;s first and largest in-game advertising network while at Massive Incorporated. Tull, Chairman and CEO of Legendary Pictures, conceived of and facilitated the Brash financial structure. Ellis, a leading media and technology industry entrepreneur, currently serves as President and CEO of Ellis Communications Group, a diversified media holding company. &#8220;To me, great movies and great video games, if well-made, can be two equally dynamic mediums. Both are immersive: both offer pure escapism,&#8221; said Thomas Tull, Chairman and CEO of Legendary Pictures, whose recent films in partnership with Warner Bros. Pictures, include 300, Superman Returns and Batman Begins. &#8220;As a lover of films and an avid gamer, I find the opportunity to more closely align these two art forms very exciting.&#8221; The Brash leadership team is rounded out by a roster of video game and entertainment industry veterans: Bill Chardavoyne, Chief Financial Officer - Chardavoyne is an entertainment industry veteran with former leadership roles at Sony Pictures Entertainment, and Viacom/MTV Networks. Chardavoyne served as CFO of Activision, Inc. for six years. Yasmin Naboa, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing- Naboa comes to Brash from Ubisoft, which she spurred to become one of the fastest growing video game companies. Larry Shapiro, Chief Creative Officer - Larry Shapiro, Chief Creative Officer &#8211; Named one of most influential people in the video game industry (Wall Street Journal, 2006) Shapiro, formerly at CAA, will play an integral role in bringing together Hollywood&#8217;s brightest creative talent with the best game design and development teams for each project. Patrick Sweeney &#8211; Senior Vice President, Business Affairs & General Counsel &#8211; Specializing in law for the game industry, Sweeney has represented numerous publishers and developers, including Vivendi Games, Gas Powered Games, Blizzard Entertainment, Sierra Entertainment, GameStop, and Dreamcatcher Interactive. Tiffany Spencer, Vice President, Communications &#8211; Spencer draws on more than twelve years of game industry experience most recently at leading publishers Electronic Arts and Ubisoft, and previously serving clients such as Microsoft, Viacom New Media, and Mplayer while at Edelman. Working alongside the best video game writers and creative directors, is an internal team of skilled producers. Their resumes include dozens of popular original and licensed games, including God of War, F.E.A.R., Mercenaries, Silent Hill, The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butchers Bay, Star Wars: Battlefront, Tony Hawk Underground, Justice League Heroes, Medal of Honor, The Incredibles, SOCOM II, Twisted Metal, Gran Turismo 4, and Spider-man 2. &#8220;The vast opportunities for creative and business collaboration between movies, music, television and the video game industry have yet to be powerfully actualized,&#8221; said Erik Brooks of ABRY Partners. &#8220;Mitch, Nicholas and their team have both the industry insight and experience to build a fundamentally new kind of entertainment company that will employ a variety of creative media platforms. Brash has a unique business model that builds on the success and growth that other leaders in the industry have established and expands a complimentary genre of games that we believe has tremendous potential.&#8221; Brash currently has licenses to develop games for films that include upcoming children&#8217;s animated films, action-packed thrillers and even horror films. In fact, Brash Entertainment will be developing multiple games based on the blockbuster horror franchise &#8220;Saw&#8221; from Lionsgate,and its producing partner, Twisted Pictures. The Saw franchise has emerged as one of the most inventive and popular franchises in the horror genre, racking up worldwide box office grosses of more than $400 and has sold more than 15 million DVDs. According to Lionsgate Vice Chairman Michael Burns, &#8220;The &#8220;Saw&#8221; franchise is a proven brand in the film space, and it&#8217;s important to us that the story translates to both the film and game experience in a way that is meaningful and exciting to both movie fans and gamers. The Brash team respects film IP, is passionate about games and cares about quality just as much as we do. They will partner with the best game developer for the project, and then we will all work together in close collaboration.&#8221; Related articles, Click here!

Go to a Section: 5:07PM EDT, Mon 4 Jun 2007 "Gromit" guru brings "Creature" to television Sun Jun 3, 2007 10:08PM EDT Tyler Perry sitcom less impressive than back-story Surfing penguins a treat for youngsters Billboard singles reviews: Pumpkins, Korn LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - "Creature Comforts" is a low-key stop-motion animation series from the guru of the form, Nick Park and his U.K.-based Aardman Studios (which also gave the world Wallace & Gromit). "Creature Comforts" began its life as a 1989 short that won Park his first Oscar (in 1990), featuring animals speaking documentary-style into a microphone from the confines of a zoo and reflecting on their lifestyle behind bars. It was turned into a hit 2005 series of nine 30-minute episodes that ran on BBC America and proved to be unfailingly adorable, sublimely clever stuff. And now, here it is as a summertime diversion on CBS, where the beastly characters have been Americanized but not stripped of a single ounce of their outrageous charm. The premise is ingenious in its simplicity. Park and his team recorded actual conversations with ordinary Americans waxing on topics including their sex lives, medical issues, hopes, fears and dreams -- and then set about inserting those phrases into the mouths of a host of elaborately crafted stop-motion critters (pigs, alligators, dogs, rabbits, wart hogs, bumblebees and countless others). The giddy effect is rather like watching an interview show while under the influence of some hallucinogenic gas. A kid talking about being afraid of needles at the doctor becomes hilarious when placed in the mouth of a porcupine. We're treated to the giddy spectacle of lady sharks discussing guys, a fly noting that women "can smell desperation," a dog making like a wine connoisseur in discussing the fragrance of another dog's butt and a guitar-serenading horse. "Creature Comforts" is a wonderfully entertaining way to spend a half-hour, reminding us anew that the greatest ideas typically spring not from elaboration but imagination. &copy; Reuters 2007.

Director Michael Bay's big-screen adaptation of one of the most popular cartoons ever will give audiences an updated vision of the struggle between the sons of Cybertron, an alien planet. The beef in "Transformers" the movie is no different than it was in the 1980s when the cartoon TV show kept kids enthralled (see " 'Transformers' Set Has Flashy Cars, Robot Models, Exploding Furbys" On the bad side, you have the ruthless dictator Megatron, who leads a commando of bloodthirsty (well, in this case, energy-thirsty) robotic warriors, the Decepticons. The Autobots are the good guys and fall in line when their commander Optimus Prime says so. All Transformers have the ability to change from robots to vehicles, fighter planes and even boomboxes (Shia LaBeouf, Tyrese Gibson, Megan Fox and Josh Duhamel are some of the big-name human stars of the flick). (Feast your eyes on four action-packed exclusive "Transformers" clips right here.) At Sunday's (June 3) 2007 MTV Movie Awards, fans will get a chance to catch some sneak glimpses at "Transformers" before it hits theaters on July 3 &#8212; and everyone checking out the red carpet will get an up-close look at some of the robots in car form. ( Scope out smokin' sneak shots of Ratchet, Jazz, Bumblebee and Ironhide, right here. ) Unfortunately, Decepticons such as Starscream, Brawl and Barricade had too much bad attitude to mix it up with the Hollywood types, but Optimus Prime did send some of his benevolent Autobots to Tinseltown for the big show. Here's a breakdown of which Transformers are making the scene at the Movie Awards, with suggestions for what songs should accompany their trips down the red carpet. "Transform and roll out!" Make and model in this summer's "Transformers" : Gray Pontiac Solstice : We first saw Jazz on the small screen as a white Porsche. : Jazz is in charge of Special Operations; some of his most outstanding capabilities are the blinding speeds he reaches in car mode and his recordable memory. : A Tribe Called Quest's "Jazz (We've Got)" would be a front-runner, but that's too easy. This sleek baby needs something with a little more kick. Nothing could be more appropriate than Justin Timberlake's "SexyBack" for Jazz to cruise to when he's not in robotic mode, bashing Decepticons. Go 'head, be gone with it. Make and model in this summer's "Transformers" : Canary-yellow Classic Camaro with black racing stripes : Bum's first incarnation as a Beetle is unforgettable. Herbie the Love Bug had nothing on him. : Literally, that's his job &#8212; reconnaissance. Being the smallest Autobot makes him the perfect spy. He's also the first one in the movie to make a human bond, with LaBeouf's character, Sam Witwicky. : Bumblebee's strength and bravery makes him the sentimental fan favorite, so why not go with Mariah Carey's emotional courage anthem "Hero." Make and model in this summer's "Transformers" : Yellow Hummer H2 : In the cartoons, Ratchet was a white ambulance. : Ratchet is a medic and he's dedicated to helping his extraterrestrial brethren and earthling friends mend. Having the words "Fire Department Search and Rescue" plastered all over his vehicle-form body couldn't spell it out any clearer. Inside, the Hummer H2 has all the amenities of an ambulance. : A no-brainer here, Beyonc&#233;'s "Ring the Alarm." Since the song's lyrics about a cheating man and his mistress wouldn't exactly fit here, we'll just go with producer Swizz Beatz's bullying instrumental for the track. The sirens in the background say it all: "Move, get out the way!" Make and model in this summer's "Transformers" : Jet-black GMC Topkick 6500 pickup truck : The old-school version of Ironhide was more Scooby Doo Mystery Machine than war-ready battalion cruiser. He was a red van. : They call him Ironhide for a reason: His trithyllium-steel alloy body makes him the Autobot least susceptible to damage. In non-geeky terms, he makes 50 Cent's bulletproof/bomb-proof car seem like a golf cart. 'Hide is so tough, he acts as personal bodyguard to his close friend and leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime. : "Big Things Poppin' "! T.I.'s lyrics make his single the perfect record for Ironhide: "Big things poppin' and little things stoppin'." The credits have rolled, but there's more coverage still pouring in!

They are written by readers, for readers. The authors are solely responsible for content. If you see any posts you consider inappropriate, please send us a note at Want to blog for the P-I? &laquo; Movie Review: Bug Movie Review: Mr. Brooks &raquo; Movie Review: Knocked Up Allison Scott (Katherine Heigl) is a 24-year-old up-and-coming entertainment journalist whose life is on the fast track. To celebrate her recent promotion at work, she goes out to the club for drinks and dancing and winds up having a one-night-stand with slacker Ben Stone (Seth Rogen) resulting in an unwanted pregnancy. Faced with the choice of going it alone or trying to make things work with the Ben, she decides to give him a chance to get to know her and see if they might be able to make a relationship work for the baby's sake. "Knocked Up" is by far the best comedy of the year. Writer/Director Judd Apatow (the same guy who created "The 40 Year Old Virgin") really knows what he's doing. All of the characters are well developed and hilarious. The script is brilliant and witty, turning intimate and private moments between the characters into comedy gold! Topics such as sex, masturbation, pregnancy, relationships, friends and so forth are brilliantly explored and I could not stop laughing the entire movie. The dialog and character interaction was incredible and very insightful. It's developed in such a way that anyone who watches it can relate to the characters and really feel their fears, anxieties, desires, understandings, etc. However, the movie was a little long and there were some slow parts that muddled things down. If they'd cut out about 25-30 minutes of the 2 hours and 9 minute running time, it would have been perfect. All in all, I'd give this movie 4 STARS (out of 5). Re-watch value: HIGH (I saw it twice already) "Knocked up" is a comedy about Allison Scott who is an up-and-coming entertainment journalist whose 24-year-old life is on the fast track. But it gets seriously derailed when a drunken one-nighter with slacker Ben Stone results in an unwanted pregnancy. Faced with the prospect of going it alone or getting to know the baby's father, Allison decides to give the lovable doof a chance. An overgrown kid who has no desire to settle down, Ben learns that he has a big decision to make with his kid's mom-to-be: will he hit the road or stay in the picture? Courting a woman you've just knocked up, however, proves to be a little difficult when the two try their hands at dating. As they discover more about one another, it becomes painfully obvious they're not soul mates they'd hoped they might be. I found "Knocked up" to is a very enjoyable movie even though it was a bit long, and there were a couple of slow spots in the middle it still turned out to be a very funny movie. A lot of folks are saying it was better than "the 40 year old virgin" however I disagree, I still this 40 is the funnier of the two movies, "Knocked up" just a more complicated plot to it. This is also one of those movies that can give geeks like myself and Rob hope (we can go be a one night stand for a good looking woman) LOL. Overall this is a very cool movie and one worth watching. Overall Rating: 3 Stars (out of 5). Re-Watch Value: High (I will most likely purchase on DVD). : This movie was originally going to be a follow up to The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005), having Seth Rogen and team to reprise their roles as the Smart Tech team. at June 3, 2007 12:22 p.m. at 6/3/07 6:00 p.m. This movie was disgusting! There was an incredible amount of language that was unnecessary. There was not much to this movie at all! It is not worth seeing even once. I am sorry I wasted even a dollar on it. I would not buy or see this movie again. I rate the movie on a 0 out of 5 stars. Do not see this movie you will regret it. at 6/3/07 6:13 p.m. knocked up is amazingly funny. maybe you should just mature a little bit, eh? go see knocked up! 5 out of 5..no doubt. at 6/3/07 6:22 p.m. Knocked Up was a combination of the hilarious and the terribly crude. I think the raunchiness outweighs the humor. The nudity and very graphic sex scenes along with the insane bad language ruined some funny parts. It also portrayed a really sad and one sided unhappy marriage that never resolves itself in the end. The shock value crowning baby head at the birth also adds nothing to the plot except for shock value. Some things - lovemaking and birth for example - are sacred and private. To graphically and grossly portray them is demeaning to the actors and to the general public. at 6/3/07 6:42 p.m. I thought it was hilarious. Knowing a friend of mine who basically was the dad in a similiar situation only made it more funny. It helps alot that while there was tremendous humor there was an actual story underneath it all. Comedy with a plot are almost unheard of these days. Unless your easily offended by anti-pc humor, go see it! at 6/3/07 7:21 p.m. My husband and our 15 year old went to see the movie. We SHOULD have read the reviews first. We had to walk out of the movies because of the foul language and sex scenes. Yes, we should have done our homework. at 6/3/07 7:55 p.m. I absolutely loved this movie! Although it had a great deal of bad language and some un-necessary parts that dragged on for what seemed like forever it was still extremely funny and was worth the money. My boyfriend and I really enjoyed watching it and based on the laughs from our sold out theater, every one there did too. at 6/3/07 8:11 p.m. Pros: Good Family/baby values presented, believable life situations make for many truly funny scenes. Cons: Foul language, sexually explicit, stoner humor not appropriate for young viewers. Overall; You will like it if you can get past the rough at 6/3/07 8:44 p.m. A movie with a R rating about a one night stand cannot be criticized for being "sexually explicit" and containing foul language, as they are the premise of the movie. Hilarious overall. at 6/3/07 8:54 p.m. Seriously, all the Christian right who is claiming that the movie was crude, rude or inappropriate obviously missed the fact that being "knocked up" is a crude pho-pa in our society already, furthermore this is a comedy about such an action and if you didn't think that was funny, you really shouldn't have gone. If you thought the concept about making fun of a one night stand and being knocked up is funny, then you'll have a blast. It has a nice ending, it even teaches a lesson (about more than birth control). It might even show people the sterotype of un-wed mothers isn't necessairly that bad. four out of five, some of the shock value was a little much. although, it's all in good fun. It's a cross between: dazed and confused and the 40 year old virgin at 6/3/07 8:55 p.m. If you're complaining about the language or the sexual stuff, don't watch a R rated movie. If you're an adult, find something else to criticize. at 6/3/07 9:32 p.m. What an idiot. You must not have kids and if you do. I feel sorry for him/her. at 6/3/07 9:39 p.m. This is my first post in here. Someone called the humor "anti-PC". Just because something IS "politically correct" doesn't mean it gets a free pass against criticism. Poop jokes are, what I would call, comedically lazy. That's what I find offensive about them. I was a big fan of Sam Kinison. I hate poop jokes. See the difference? Sam Kinison was politically incorrect. Poop jokes are not. They're just offensive in that they are a comedic shortcut and an easy manipulation of an easily fed and overly manipulated modern audience. Someone in here criticized the mother who is raising a "girly boy." It sounds to me like she is raising a kid who will have some taste and truly have a backbone instead of being someone who just follows the herd and laughs at what everyone else laughs at. To call someone a "girly boy" says more about you than it does about the Mom. What a gross generalization you made. Liking poop jokes makes you more manly? We need more people like that Mom who will instill some taste back into our collective comedy. And just so you don't go and make a gross generalization about me or my manliness, I'll use the Sam Kinison reference again. Kinison had taste. He had insight. Graphic humor and bodily function humor lacks taste. That's what I think people are railing against when they complain about modern humor. at 6/3/07 9:39 p.m. This movie is not for prudes like Christian conservatives and Islamic militants. All rest will enjoy. at 6/3/07 9:44 p.m. Correcting my last post. Damn I gotta proofread more. I meant to say "Just because something IS 'politically incorrect' doesn't mean it gets a free pass against criticism." at 6/3/07 9:53 p.m. That's the problem with the so called "free thinker" only their view counts and no one better contradict you or else you resolve to say that because Christians disagree with you me are narrow minded. Well guess again the move was awful and that's what I thought about it. at 6/3/07 9:55 p.m. This is my first post in here. I keep trying to post this and these codes are making it difficult. Someone called the humor "anti-PC". Just because something IS "politically incorrect" doesn't mean it gets a free pass against criticism. Poop jokes are, what I would call, comedically lazy.

Graphic humor and bodily function humor lacks taste. That's what I think people are railing against when they complain about modern humor. at 6/3/07 10:26 p.m. I can't believe they didn't catch this really big hole in editing. When the unhappy married couple are talking, they say they got married ten years earlier because the dad got the mother pregant. Then a little while later, they throw an 8th birthday party for the oldest daughter. The math just doesn't add up. Overall, it wasn't my favorite movie but I thought the dialog was some of the most realistic I've seen in a movie lately. As a writer I really enjoyed the care put into character development and realistic yet MEANINGFUL dialog. They weren't just yakking through a slice-of-life like some movies. Everything that was said served to build the meaning of their relationships. Well-written, graphic and realistic. This is not my life, but it's somebody's. at 6/3/07 11:08 p.m. I'm pretty liberal and I enjoy a lot of humor that many conservative people would find way too crude. I can't quite figure out why anyone over 10 finds most bathroom humor funny. Fart jokes, semen jokes, shit jokes, pee jokes--by the time you hit your teens in the US you should have seen and heard enough that you were ready for something really funny. A comedian that has to resorts to them probably can't be funny any other way or just never grew up, IMHO. Adam Sandler is enormously talented and very funny, for example, except when he falls back on fart jokes. Both this movie and 40-year-old Virgin were interesting, sad-but-funny portraits of what most people would call losers, and I think both were ALMOST worth seeing. But every time the writers got stuck somebody said, "I know! Let's give the guy diarrhea!" That's not funny, it's just plain sad and shows a lack of talent. I don't think the movie is appropriate for children. If they cleaned up the bathroom jokes, it might be appropriate for adults. I wish the guys who made these movies would trust themselves enough to forget about the farts and just make a good movie. at 6/4/07 12:27 a.m. What a dumb movie - I think this and the baby shows out now are being heavily promoted to replenish the supply of dwindling males in the population - thanks to BUSH's nonsensical, expensive, and unwin - able war. at 6/4/07 5:23 a.m. The truth is that there are people in our country (USA) that live under the believe that these type of people don't exist. People don't swear, or have one night stands, or go to strip clubs, or fart on peoples pillows. Usually these people are Christian Conservatives, Republicans, and overall conservative in nature. Maybe these type of people didn't enjoy college, or go to a kegger in high school. Maybe they didn't smoke pot as teenagers or sneak out on a Friday night while their parents slept, and that's okay. None of those things are a right of passage to adulthood. However, those people, no matter what their religious or social background, who feel that this movie doesn't portray a healthy segment of our overall population are fooling themselves. You don't have to like that people have sex with strangers, smoke pot, go to strip clubs, or say f%$# every other word, but don't try and tell someone that they can't or shouldn't. If it's not funny to you, why did you go? Someone said, "it's a movie about a one night stand", seriously, does every movie have to be toned down to a 4th grade level? I'm tired of PC movies, or PG-13 ratings, and of dialog that is only used on the mickey mouse club. Life is a pain filled emotional roller coaster full of swearing, sweating, and stress. And I enjoy everyday of it, and I enjoy the fact that I get each day to enjoy it. You should too, and for everyone reading this, the movie is just what people say, and it's funny. Plain and simple, it's funny if you just enjoy the fact that you respect everyones right to live and be who they want to be, if you like to criticize and pass judgment on people, sorry, this might not be your movie, but your life probably really isn't that enjoyable for even you if that's the case. Enjoy the hell out of living, you'll be dead before you know it. (Sorry to ramble) at 6/4/07 6:14 a.m. Jeez, all the lady was saying was to research the movie if you want to bring younger children to see it! I am amazed at all the retort to this one entry. As a mother (or father) it is your duty to raise your children in the way that you see fit, not others. This woman just wanted to raise a red flag to other parents of younger children who thought to take them to see the movie. Chill out! You all have issues! at 6/4/07 9:43 a.m. it was a great movie. Katherine Heigl's character was a little dry for me, where as everyone else actually had character, especially her sister and co-worker at E!. She just seemed the same from Grey's...not much expansion for comedy. Also, wanted a little more closure in the sister and brother-n-law marriage...but can't be too picky. All in all it was hilarious! The start with Wu-Tang's ODB "Shimmey Shimmey ya'll" was perfect to hype you up! Gotta Love Seth Rogen! at 6/4/07 9:48 a.m. funny movie! I actually went with my 2 children 12 and 13. Times I was a "bit" embarrased, but still thought it was a riot.... YES I AM A GOOD MOM!!!!!! at 6/4/07 9:56 a.m. The thing is, this is an R-rated film, obviously not for the younger viewers, anyway. The lady says "This R-rated film is not for kids!" Well duh! And anyone who's familiar with Apatow or Rogen should know exactly what they're getting into with this film. There are no surprises here. at 6/4/07 9:56 a.m. okay, okay. the movie is called "knocked up" and everyone knows it's about a one night stand. why on earth someone would take their kid to a movie like this is beyond me. but the movie is hilarious if it's the kind of comedy you're into. i like how Paul Rudd's situation doesn't get resolved. i'd say this movie is like a chick-flick, but for guys. i'd say a dick-flick, but that just has bad connatation written all over it. at 6/4/07 10:00 a.m. at 6/4/07 2:00 p.m. Yes the language and scenes are rude and crude. That was part and parcel of the characters, particularly Ben and his friends who are stuck in an infantile stage. A lot of the humor is scatological; a lot is solid. It is funny. Perhaps I am way out, but I found the love story charming and fresh. It's too bad this film was so crude, the beautiful story was overwhelmed. I'll add this movie to my collection to be seen over and over. Login below to post a comment. Registered users, log in here HELP!

New York Boss Phil and Jersey boss Tony stepped up their war, and put a hit on each other. Phil also puts a hit on Syl and Bobby. The show started with Syl whacking one of Phil&#8217;s stooges, then Tony talking with his FBI &#8220;friend&#8221; who tells Tony New York has ordered the hits. Tony hires outside help to whack Phil, but the hitman killed the wrong guy and Tony realizes he has to go into hiding. Dr. Melfi, meanwhile, is at a dinner party at her psychiatrist&#8217;s home, and he violates her confidences and mentions at a table full of colleagues that she has a gangster patient. One of the other dinner guests quickly guesses it is Tony Soprano. Melfi, at the urging of Elliot, (her shrink) reads a recent study about sociopaths not being helped by talk therapy. In fact, the article says the sociopath manipulates a shrink and validates his behavior. So after she reads this study, Tony comes to her office and starts talking about his problems, and she is cold, sarcastic and judgmental. She finally tells him therapy is over. Tony is baffled by this abrupt decision, especially since he is in crisis with his son A.J., who is still suffering from depression. I was very disappointed in how the writers handled this segment. After 8 or 9 years of watching Dr. Melfi, this is not the way she would end therapy with a patient, even Tony. However&#8230; The writers of this show are so good, I bet she&#8217;s back next week with a better explanation. It was just too abrupt. Back to the show, though. Tony&#8217;s brother-in-law Bobby is shot and killed while shopping for electric trains. Tony goes home and tells Carm she needs to take the kids and go someplace safe for a few days. When Tony told Carm Bobby was dead, Carm didn&#8217;t even come close to crying, which is out of character for her character. Think back to anytime she heard someone was killed and she was always the first to scream and/or cry. And yet Bobby was her brother-in-law and she had no reaction to being told he was dead. Too strange. While Tony is with Carm, Patsy and Sylvio are shot. Patsy runs away, but Syl is left for dead by the hitman. Syl is in the hospital in a coma and not expected to wake up. Carm and Meadow stop by to see Janice, (where was A.J.?) and Tony and Paulie along with Tony&#8217;s driver and another guy go to a safe house. It ended with Tony lying down in bed with the gun Bobby gave him in the first episode of this season. The camera did a visceral move, as if trying to make you think someone was closing in on Tony. Will Tony get whacked next week? Will Paulie betray Tony? Will the Arabs Tony turned in to the FBI turn out to be terrorists and Tony will save us from them? Will Dr. Melfi be back? Will Syl live? Will A.J. die? 1 comment for Will Tony Soprano get whacked next week? Tony will go to use that gun that Bobby gave him and for some reason it will not work. Bobby was incompetant and the gun thou given as agift will fail Tony just as Bobby failed the Soprano Family!

Talking to reporters on Friday (June 1) about the impending demise of Sci Fi Channel's "Battlestar Galactica," David Eick, co-creator/executive producer of the "Them" pilot, revealed that the show may still be in play. "It's not dead," Eick revealed. "They are talking to us about perhaps spending money on it and trying things and getting it into play I guess for midseason. All I know is it's still in play and something the network is very actively talking about. We'll know more in the next weeks and months." There's ample precedent for FOX opting to redevelop rejected pilots after-the-fact. Last season, for example, the network put "Drive" on the air at midseason after recasting and reshooting the initial pilot. Eick wrote the "Them" pilot with John McNamara ("Eyes"). Jonathan Mostow ("Breakdown") directed. Based on the graphic novel by Michael Avon Oeming and Daniel Berman, the series focused on government efforts to break up a sleeper cell of aliens operating out of Los Angeles. The pilot features James D'Arcy, Ben Feldman, Rachel Nichols and "Battlestar Galactica" veteran Tricia Helfer. "Battlestar" is currently shooting its fourth season in Vancouver. Producers on the Peabody Award-winning series announced last week that the 22-episode season will be its last. Even if FOX doesn't end up bringing "Them" to series, Eick should be able to stay busy. He's one of the producers on NBC's "Bionic Woman" revamp. Pick your favorite channels Customize our TV listings to show only the channels you care about.

Uncaging some funny lines CBS's new summer half-hour comedy "Creature Comforts," based on the British TV series, puts the voices of ordinary people into the mouths of clay-animated animals. (AARDMAN ANIMATIONS LTD.) By Matthew Gilbert, Globe Staff | The great thing about "Creature Comforts" is the way it celebrates the rich character of the average human voice. The concept is simple: CBS's new summer comedy puts the voices of ordinary people into the mouths of clay-animated animals. That panda or snail or bird talking to the camera about life is really just Joe or Jane or Junior Blow, recorded by the show's creators. And yet the result of this simple ventriloquism, which you can catch tonight at 8 on Channel 4, is surprisingly flavorful. Based on the British series, which was based on the Oscar-winning short by Nick Park of "Wallace & Gromit," the show posits the idea that each of us has an animal within. The stop-motion animators, with Park as executive producer, take the tones and words of recorded voices and match them -- often ironically -- to funny creatures. Sometimes, the overall impact is poetic, such as tonight's image of two porcupines talking to the camera: "I'm not really scared of needles," one says, "but she probably is." Other times the effect is more overtly funny -- the image of a dog sniffing another dog's behind, while his voice exalts in the subtleties of the bouquet of a fine wine. The not-so-great thing about "Creature Comforts" is that a little goes a long way. A half-hour of talking lobsters, caged birds, bulldogs, and fish is about 25 minutes more than we need. The sweetness of the show would be better consumed in smaller doses -- on YouTube, say, or during commercial breaks, as a way to inspire DVR viewers not to fast-forward through ads. The episodes don't have plots; they are only built on vague themes such as doctors, or secrets and lies. And so each half-hour wanders on a bit, going nowhere special, kind of like a turtle.

Ive got three more of them for you here. The first is an extended version of the Bonecrusher versus Optimus fight weve already seen a piece of. This takes it a further though, and gives you an idea of the scale Michael Bay is going for with this movie. Optimus tackles Bonecrusher and literally throws him off a freeway. Its completely eye-popping. Give me plenty of that kind of giant robot action Bay, and this is going to be an awesome movie. Watch it: The second, is an extended version of the Helicopter attack sequence that youve already seen in the trailers. This debuted on Ellen, so its all about Josh Duhamel acting. As if anyone is going to this movie for the acting. Seriously. But, if youre wondering what the non-robot characters will act like in the film, then here you go: The third is a clip from last nights MTV Movie Awards. They inserted Sarah Silverman into a scene from , and had Optimus Prime speak to her. Its the best look weve had at Primes mouth movie, and its also the longest string of dialogue weve heard from Peter Cullen. Cullens voice sounds pretty good here, better than in some of the other clips weve seen. Watch it: Read our preview of this movie.

So, how are they trying to adjust? It's one of the selling points of Tivo or a DVR (digital video recorder) system. You can record your favorite shows and fast forward through any annoying commercials. So, how many people do this? A recent report from Nielsen Media Research says 17 percent of all American homes have a digital recorder, and 60 percent of those people skip through ads. How many times would people say they stop and rewind to see a commercial they like? One person answers, "Once in a great while, I'll go back and watch a commercial, but it's rare." So, what are advertising executives doing to make this rare commercial that people actually want to watch? Well, for one thing, some of them are trying to make commercials look less like commercials. "There is this trend of creating a mini-drama or a mini-comedy series, so if you see one spot, you want to see the continuation of that spot. You want to see the ext phase of it," says Richter 7's Partner Peggy Lander. She says the old methods of advertising as we know them are slowly dying and that people are using web services and sites like youtube.com to filter which ads they want to see. The rest, they ignore. "Sometimes advertisers kill us with frequency. The message isn't creative, it isn't compelling but if we see it enough, it's going to make a difference. We're going to notice their product," Lander says. According to Lander, "Some commercials are so bad they actually get attention, too." She says sometimes advertisers make lame looking commercials just so we'll talk about how lame they are. Along with these mini-dramas or comedies, some networks are holding mini contests during commercial breaks. Court TV is expected to come out with a mini-mystery where someone could win $25,000. The only clues to the mystery come during the commercial breaks.

Unquestionably this new staging - with a team headed by Kevin McKenzie, the company&#39;s artistic director; Gelsey Kirkland, the former ballerina, and Michael Chernov, a dramaturge - provides less than a dim shadow of the 1890 masterpiece by choreographer Marius Petipa and composer Pyotr Tchaikovsky. Most of Tchaikovsky&#39;s score is there, some even added, but only the most famous bits of Petipa&#39;s choreography remain, including, blessedly intact, the entire dance text for the ballerina, Aurora. It is, of course, like producing "Hamlet," leaving Hamlet&#39;s role untouched, but having the story slightly adapted and the verse largely rewritten by overambitious stage managers. Even after reading the synopsis, the story now doesn&#39;t make much sense, while Tony Walton&#39;s settings and Willa Kim&#39;s costumes - both doubtless costing more than meets the eye - are as appropriately provincial as you might find in Omsk, Tomsk or some other whistle-stop on the Trans-Siberian railway. This is vastly inferior in concept, authority, dance text and even design to both the two earlier ABT stagings, the Skeaping/Messel in 1976 and the MacMillan/Georgiadis in 1987. The acting now is horrifyingly "motivated" as if the entire cast was auditioning for a German expressionist silent movie. This is hardly Petipa, even if the style of the dancing is generally more authentic. In the first-night cast, Marcelo Gomes as Prince Desire and especially Veronika Part as Aurora proved very disappointing, letting the evening subside around them like melting blancmange, although an undeterred Herman Cornejo flew high and mighty as the Bluebird. Both of Saturday&#39;s casts were a great deal better - Gillian Murphy, as Aurora in the evening, was a paragon of technique, and she was beautifully matched by Ethan Stiefel&#39;s Prince, nobly showing the true grand manner. Saturday afternoon had an ardent and gracious Angel Corella partnering a truly wondrous Paloma Herrera, who more than once suggested another Aurora with South American ethnic roots, the great Margot Fonteyn. Such performances - and a few other ones, such as Sascha Radetsky&#39;s controlled power as the Bluebird, also Sarah Lane as Princess Florine, and both Michele Wiles and Stella Abrera as the Lilac Fairy - suggest that, despite the tawdry new staging, individuals will continue to offer considerable pleasure and artistry. The dancers face an uphill struggle, and will certainly all achieve more by acting less. This is not meant to be 21st-century soap opera - it&#39;s 19th-century ballet.

Team Up Literary World Finds New Audience Through Online Advertising YouTube Gets A Boost The Size Of EMI Rupert Murdoch One Step Closer To Owning Everything Nielsen Ratings Tell All. How Wil Advertisers Bounce Back? Last week Nielsen released its commercial rating data comfirming what has been speculated for some time now: that about 5% to 10% fewer people watch commercials than the show in which they appear. Networks are more interested in TiVo talk. The push will come for the upfront to include DVR viewers, hoping that a figure will come out that is at least around last year&#8217;s pfront take, estimated at $8.75 billion to $9 billion.u Even though reports show hat 97% of viewing occurs live, the tv networks still shift the focus to DVR users. Marketers expecting toÂ  discuss the large number of viewers lost during commercial breaks were surprised to be caught in the value of live viewers vs. DVR users debate. Until now, marketers have paid TV networks for ad time based on the popularity of shows, not viewership of the commercials themselves. Commercial ratings are going to change that, allowing prices to be set by viewership of ad breaks. While the new Nielsen ratings don&#8217;t track individual ads or specific time slots, they offer average viewership of all the national commercial minutes in a program. And that could be the blueprint upon which this year&#8217;s upfront deals are struck. Buyers and sellers seem to be coming to an agreement on &#8220;live plus three,&#8221; allowing the ratings to include viewers who watch as many as three days later. &#8220;It gives the media credit for the way in which people are and will increasingly watch TV, and that&#8217;s in some sort of time-shifted mode,&#8221; said Alan Wurtzel, president-research and media development for NBC Universal. The problem is that most viewers who can scroll past ads&#8230;.do. According to Nielsen, about 17% of U.S households have DVRs, and viewers 18 to 49 watch 10% of all broadcast-network prime-time programming via DVR. Network executives estimate more than half of those viewers skip the ads altogether. A number of big-spending categories are time sensitive. Package-goods marketers, for instance, often use TV ads to push products being promoted with coupons. If an ad tells people to &#8220;pick it up in this Sunday&#8217;s paper,&#8221; and the ad is viewed after Sunday, &#8220;that message has now been devalued,&#8221; said Scott Haugenes, senior VP-group director, national broadcast, Initiative. Fast-food marketers often have tie-ins to short-lived promotions &#8212; offers for particular sandwiches or film openings. Even though DVRs don&#8217;t account for the majority of viewers, &#8220;there will be more every single day,&#8221; said Ed Gold, director-corporate advertising for State Farm Insurance. &#8220;We are very concerned about utilizing any playback numbers until it&#8217;s proven to us that people actually watch the commercials during playback.&#8221; Still with commercial ratings being developed, the year&#8217;s upfront is anticipated to progress at a lethargic pace.

However, commercial ratings could have an unintentional negative side effect. If shows are supported based on whether or not their viewers watch the commercial, we may end up with a bunch of boring shows geared at older, non-tech savvy people. Commercial ratings should ONLY be used to tell sponsors whether or not they produced a commercial the people actually want to watch. They should not be used to determine whether or not to sponsor a show. If you make a good and engaging commercial, people will watch it.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not, however, outlaw the policy outright. It ruled in favor of a Fox Television-led challenge to the policy and returned the case to the FCC to let the agency try to provide a "reasoned analysis" for its new approach to indecency and profanity. The broadcasters had asked the appeals court last year to invalidate the FCC's conclusion that profanity-laced broadcasts on four different shows were indecent, even though no fines were issued. Included in the arguments were references to a January 2003 broadcast of the Golden Globes awards show by NBC when U2 lead singer Bono uttered the phrase "f------ brilliant." A year later, the FCC said the "F-word" in any context "inherently has a sexual connotation" and can be subject to enforcement action. David Fiske, an FCC spokesman, said the commission was reviewing the decision and "we'll respond as soon as we finish that review." A spokesman for Fox did not immediately return a phone message for comment. In a 2-to-1 ruling, the appeals court said it found that the FCC's new policy regarding so-called fleeting expletives "represents a significant departure from positions previously taken by the agency and relied on by the broadcast industry." The appeals court said agencies are free to revise their rules and policies but it said they must provide a reasoned analysis, something the FCC had failed to do. In a majority opinion written by Judge Rosemary Pooler, the appeals court said all speech covered by the FCC's indecency policy is fully protected by the First Amendment. "With that backdrop in mind, we question whether the FCC's indecency test can survive First Amendment scrutiny," the appeals court said. "For instance, we are sympathetic to the Networks' contention that the FCC's indecency test is undefined, indiscernible, inconsistent, and consequently, unconstitutionally vague." The court said it could understand why the networks argue that the FCC's indecency policy "fails to provide the clarity required by the Constitution, creates an undue chilling effect on free speech and requires broadcasters to 'steer far wider of the unlawful zone.'" "Indeed, we are hard pressed to imagine a regime that is more vague than one that relies entirely on consideration of the otherwise unspecified 'context' of a broadcast indecency," it said. "It appears that under the FCC's current indecency regime, any and all uses of an expletive is presumptively indecent and profane with the broadcaster then having to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission, under an unidentified burden of proof, that the expletives were `integral' to the work. "In the licensing context, the Supreme Court has cautioned against speech regulations that give too much discretion to government officials," the court said. The appeals court gave a nod to what it called "today's realities" when it mentioned the ability of parents to limit what their children see with technological tools that recently have been made available. "The proliferation of satellite and cable television channels - not to mention internet-based video outlets - has begun to erode the 'uniqueness' of broadcast media, while at the same time, blocking technologies such as the V-chip have empowered viewers to make their own choices about what they do, and do not, want to see on television," the appeals court wrote. In a dissent, Judge Pierre Leval said the FCC had given a "sensible, although not necessarily compelling, reason" for its new policy. He noted that the FCC had concluded that the F-word "is of such graphic explicitness in inevitable reference to sexual activity that absence of repetition does not save it from violating the standard of decency."

Broadcasting & Cable Today B&C Local Cable Advertising Sales B&C Hispanic Television Update B&C Telco IP Update By Ben Grossman -- Broadcasting & Cable, 6/4/2007 1:30:00 PM On a sunny morning in a meeting room at NBC&#39;s New York offices, just before its upfront presentation, network brass assured reporters squeezed around a conference table that this was not a repeat performance. Unlike one year ago, when NBC completely reworked its schedule just weeks after unveiling it at Radio City Music Hall, they did not expect to make any seismic changes this time around. Twenty-two days later, they fired the architect of the new schedule, Entertainment President Kevin Reilly, and hired hot Hollywood producer, Ben Silverman, as co-chairman. Now it falls to Silverman, a highly-regarded packager but an unproven corporate executive, to restore luster to the once-proud Peacock network. While the hire shocked many, even inside NBC, many laud the fourth-place network for taking a chance on an unconventional thinker who may be better able to navigate the roiling seas of network television. Indeed, NBC&#39;s audacious late-hour move may signal a new era when big media companies are forced to staff up with a new breed of TV executives who can embrace the unconventional financial models that may be the future of the TV business. Silverman comes to NBC Universal with huge pressure to perform, given that its television business is already a couple of years into a rebuilding phase. The patience of General Electric brass and their stockholders is being tested by a division that many consider to be a drag on its stock price despite its high profile and growth potential. &#8220;The entertainment division is a huge perceptual issue and something we have to get fixed,&#8221; says NBCU President/CEO Jeff Zucker. The decision to install Silverman stemmed from a meeting the two had in Zucker&#39;s New York office during upfront week to discuss matters pertaining to the current first-look deal between NBCU and Silverman&#39;s company, Reveille. During that meeting, Silverman told Zucker he was contemplating a career move. Zucker jumped at the chance to snatch him up. Zucker says he was not planning on replacing Reilly at the time. Asked in a phone interview what would have happened to Reilly if he and Silverman hadn&#39;t had that meeting, Zucker responded, &#8220;Then you and I aren&#39;t talking right now.&#8221; NOT A TOTAL SHOCK While the timing of the move left many industry insiders scratching their heads&#8212;especially after Reilly had just signed a new three-year deal valued at several million dollars&#8212;the programming chief&#39;s departure was not a total shock. After NBC&#39;s ratings hit record lows this spring, its May 25 upfront presentation in New York did little to signal a significant turnaround. A reliance on adding episodes of current shows, not introducing a single new comedy, and ads touting Jerry Seinfeld for his upcoming DreamWorks movie left many ad execs wondering what was being said about the network&#39;s development. Still, many industry executives believe that Reilly was never given the autonomy or financial backing to do his best work. His supporters note that he was forced to operate amidst drastic budget cuts under the &#8220;NBC 2.0&#8221; umbrella, which targeted 700 jobs and $750 million in cuts. Reilly was also limited in the number of pilots he bought, as well as from where he bought them. For example, he ordered far fewer pilots than the other major networks despite NBC&#39;s fourth-place status and bought comedies only from NBC&#39;s own studio. Reilly declined to comment. Many in Hollywood, including ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson, a close friend, says Reilly was unfairly fired. &#8220;The treatment he has gotten has been disgusting,&#8221; McPherson says of Reilly&#39;s time at NBCU, a period that produced such hits as . &#8220;He brought back quality, class and success over there and put his balls on the line better than anyone in the business, myself included. I don&#39;t know what more you can ask for.&#8221; McPherson says Reilly is taking the blame for problems that went beyond his control. &#8220;Is there a limit on scapegoats?&#8221; he asks. &#8220;To do these jobs effectively, you have to be given the support and control for good or bad. It certainly never appeared he got that.&#8221; NBC executives declined to respond to McPherson&#39;s comments, but they expressed confidence that Silverman is the right leader to pull the network out of its quagmire. &#8220;The only message we are trying to send here is, we&#39;re not satisfied with the position we are in and we need to do better,&#8221; Zucker says. &#8220;Ben is an incredibly accomplished producer and developer and executive who thinks globally and thinks about advertisers and digital and content in relation to all of it, and that&#39;s what we have to be about as a company.&#8221; Many ad executives are excited about Silverman&#39;s understanding of their needs, such as the value of branded integration dating back to his , which was completely financed by advertisers. Even in the short term, the change won&#39;t harm the network&#39;s upfront sales prospects, say some, because fourth-place NBC was never in a position to lead the upfront market anyway. &#8220;It&#39;s a continuation of NBC&#39;s issues over the past three years,&#8221; says one ad buyer. And producers, especially those who are heavily involved in branded integration, are eager to work with Silverman. &#8220;Both Hollywood and Madison Avenue tend to cheer for Ben&#39;s successes,&#8221; says Madison Road Entertainment Managing Partner Jak Severson. &#8220;He genuinely wants to create new models and gets the business as well as the creative side of the new Hollywood.&#8221; A major question surrounding the affable Silverman is whether he can parlay his prominence as a packager, producer and idea man into success in GE&#39;s legendary corporate environment. &#8220;I was very clear to them about what I am and who I am as a creative entrepreneur,&#8221; says Silverman, who oversaw 32 full-time employees at Reveille. &#8220;I may not be the traditional GE guy, but I don&#39;t know a lot of creative guys who would fit into any corporate structure.&#8221; To ease that shortcoming, Zucker will place the high-energy Silverman side by side with newly promoted Co-Chairman Marc Graboff, the more business-oriented former president of NBC Universal Television, West Coast. Silverman also says he will be aided by a familiarity with NBC&#39;s practices: &#8220;Luckily, I have worked alongside it in a number of ways since Reveille shares a lot of the same policies and structures around our productions.&#8221; Among his first tasks will be putting together his executive team, which will include Reilly&#39;s former number two, Katherine Pope, just named president of the studio, as first reported Friday by She had become frustrated after learning that NBCU was not going to merge its network and studio, a strategy toward which it had been leaning. Pope was in line to assume a larger role in that shift. Former studio chief Angela Bromstad is expected to remain with the organization, most likely focusing on the international production side of the business should she accept a role in London. Silverman may also bring some of his former charges from Reveille, with speculation already surfacing about a prominent role at NBC for respected development executive Teri Weinberg. NBC executives are betting that Silverman will be much more than a programmer and hope he can infuse the network with new financial strategies. &#8220;Ben has always been about thinking about new models,&#8221; Zucker says. &#8220;And given the world of network primetime television, whether you&#39;re in first place or fourth place, these times call for new and different models.&#8221; While Silverman won&#39;t have much immediate impact on the fall schedule this late in the cycle&#8212;he hadn&#39;t even seen all of NBC&#39;s pilots as of late last week&#8212;he does grant NBC a fresh helping of goodwill, on both Madison Avenue and Wall Street. &#8220;They&#39;re making the right steps and tweaking the formula at NBC to get them back on track,&#8221; says Richard Steinberg, president of Steinberg Global Asset Management, which counts GE among the largest holdings in its $500 million portfolio. &#8220;NBC, in the short run, has fallen from its star status, but that doesn&#39;t mean the machine is broken. It needs repair and new leadership, and that&#39;s what management has done.&#8221; Despite the positive response to Zucker&#39;s latest attempt to turn the slumping television business around, there are still GE stockholders who would like to see the company spin off or sell NBCU. Indeed, as that business looks to reverse its fortunes, speculation abounds that potential suitors are biding their time. The suspects include cash-rich cable operator Comcast, private equity firms, IAC&#39;s Barry Diller and one of IAC&#39;s largest investors and allies, Liberty Media boss John Malone, either alone or together. By acquiring NBCU, Liberty would instantly become an entertainment giant on par with News Corp. in scope, with Liberty&#39;s DirecTV, Starz/Encore pay channels and majority stake in the Discovery networks joining NBCU&#39;s broadcast and cable properties. BULL&#39;S-EYE ON HIS BACK But few expect a spinoff or sale soon. People familiar with the company say GE wants to stay in the media business and believes it can right the ship. Additionally, insiders say NBC is integral to the GE corporate culture, fromits equipment division&#39;s taking railroad people to NBC&#39;s box at Notre Dame games to providing Wimbledon tickets to key clients. They say a transaction would have to be so financially compelling that it would leave GE little choice. &#8220;Even as much as we would like to see NBC a separate operating unit, we don&#39;t see it in the cards from GE right now,&#8221; says Steinberg. &#8220;We do not think that [GE Chairman/CEO] Jeff Immelt, in the near term at least, has any interest in spinning off, divesting or otherwise changing the corporate structure of NBCU from how it&#39;s currently structured. As much as people are rattling sabers over wanting this done, we think it&#39;s falling on deaf ears.&#8221; While critics say the shakeup is another example of Zucker&#39;s deflecting blame for NBC&#39;s woes, many insiders give him credit for taking an aggressive stance to fix the schedule&#8212;and the business. Now it&#39;s up to his star player, Silverman, to show the confidence that earned him a reputation as a great salesman. &#8220;The bull&#39;s-eye is on my back, and I&#39;m prepared to live with it,&#8221; says Silverman. &#8220;I had zits and braces and was six-two and 130 pounds in high school. I can handle it.&#8221; Additional reporting by Jim Benson, Anne Becker and Marisa Guthrie There are no comments posted for this article. , a division of Use of this Web site is subject to its Reed Business Interactive Network Supply Chain Management Review Graphics Arts Blue Book Gifts & Decorative Accessories Foodservice Equipment & Supplies Test & Measurement World Building Design & Construction
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19033979/&cid Will Paris learn her lesson? Letâs hope so - Celebrity Insights - MSNBC.com Will Paris learn her lesson? Letâs hope so Our columnist looks back on her encounters with the charming socialite Paris Hilton turned herself in to begin her three-week stint at the Century Regional Detention Facility. Hours after strolling the red carpet in a strapless black dress, Hilton traded her designer duds for a jail-issued jumpsuit. By By Miki Turner I donât know what pleases me most. The fact that The Rock is reportedly leaving his wife or that Paris Hilton is now behind bars. OK. Donât start clogging up my mailbox. Iâm really sorry that The Rockâs marriage is busting up. Thatâs not even funny. A girl, however, can dream about being his pebble mama canât she? But even though Iâm glad Hilton is now in the slammer and will hopefully engage in some R&R â redemption and reflection â thatâs really no laughing matter either. Hilton, 26, turned herself in late Sunday night just a few hours after attending the MTV Movie Awards where host Sarah Silverman made the hotel heiress the butt of numerous jokes. Prior to the show, Hilton told reporters on the red carpet that she was scared, but ready to serve her time. She also said that she hoped she could serve as âan example to other young people when they make decisions.â Thatâs one of those jokes you canât laugh at â particularly if she really believes that. The charms of Paris Iâve met Paris Hilton a few times. The first time was right before âThe Simple Lifeâ â the reality show starring Hilton and her BFF Nicole Richie â Â hit the air and became appointment TV. I had no idea who she was then but she seemed fairly harmless, standing alone behind a potted plant in a hotel corridor chomping on carrot sticks and celery. That night our paths crossed again at a Fox network party. Hilton and Richie crashed the mattress I was sharing with some friends of mine from the Television Critics Association. Once the heiress and her bud plopped their well-toned derrieres down, giddiness ensued. After a few moments of hushed amazement, one of the critics asked Richie if Hilton was wearing underwear. âOf course she is,â Richie responded. âI saw her put them on.â This is why critics shouldnât drink and why celebrities should never mix and mingle with them drunk or sober. Shortly after that enlightening exchange, I saw Hilton dancing by herself in a corner. Thinking that sheâd refuse, I invited her to come dance with a bunch of us. Much to my surprise she came over and shook her narrow little groove thing for about 10 seconds before bidding us ado with a wink and a wave. While I didnât think she was hot, she was pretty darn cool. Snubbed by a socialite Paris Hilton turns herself in early June 4: Last night the heiress, who said she's ready to face her sentence, began her 23-day stay. NBC's Jennifer London reports. The second meeting was about two years later at another soiree. By this time the carrot-eating girl who put her undies on in front of her friends was Paris Hilton. Sheâd become this media whore who never missed a party, perpetually charmed the paparazzi and had essentially become famous for being the star of a lame reality show and for not knowing when to leave the party. On that occasion, Hilton, sans Richie, entered the club with an entourage of three. She seemed oblivious to everyone and everything save for the cell phone attached to her ear. She was so busy chatting with whomever that she didnât even acknowledge me trying not acknowledge her. I was so adversely affected by that snub that I really considered hiring a therapist. Paris in the spotlight See images of media darling Paris Hilton. Itâs kind of hard, however, not to fall under Hiltonâs spell. As she stood there, people initially resisted the urge to throw their tape recorders in her face. As a few critics started to make their initial descent, Hilton slipped into the ladies room. When she re-emerged the cat-and-mouse game with the press started again. While still on her cell, Hilton dispatched one of her assistants to fetch her a glass of some clear liquid from the bar. But hereâs the trip part. When the girl returned, Hilton actually made her hold the glass while she took sporadic sips out of it. Thatâs the image Iâm replaying in my head as I think about Hilton sitting in a 12-by-8 county jail cell in Lynwood, Calif. where sheâll have no cell or no one to hold her drink. How will she deal? Iâd like to feel sorry for her, but you know what? Sheâs in jail for willingly violating the terms of her probation. Itâs not like she was wrongly accused of a crime she didnât commit. Plus, we need a break from her. She has consistently flaunted her wealth, her dogs, her numerous fiancÃ©es and her various hair extensions in our faces for far too long. But weâre going to have to wait on that break. Unfortunately, Hiltonâs fame will likely increase tenfold now that sheâs serving time. Paris Hilton checks into L.A. County jailÂ Â  Jail bad?

The U.S. Federal Communications Commission had ruled in March 2006 that News Corp.'s (NWSa.N: Fox television network had violated decency regulations when singer Cher and actress Nicole Richie blurted out profanities during the 2002 and 2003 Billboard Music Awards' shows. However, no fines were issued. A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York, in a 2-1 ruling, said that the FCC's "new policy sanctioning 'fleeting expletives' is arbitrary and capricious." The court sent the matter back to the commission for further proceedings. Fox had challenged the FCC's decision, arguing that the government's decency standard was unclear, violated free speech protections and that the rulings had contradicted findings in past cases. Both sides presented oral arguments before the U.S. appeals court panel in December 2006. In their written ruling on Monday, Judges Rosemary Pooler and Peter Hall said that the FCC policy on indecency standards "represents a significant departure from positions previously taken by the agency and relied on by the broadcast industry" and that the commission "has failed to articulate a reasoned basis for this change in policy." Judge Pierre Leval issued a dissenting opinion, writing that he believed the FCC "gave a reasoned explanation for its change of standard."

http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7007541337&cid AHN | "Transformers" Movie To Premiere A Day Earlier Than Expected | June 4, 2007 global news for the digital world "Transformers" Movie To Premiere A Day Earlier Than Expected June 4, 2007 12:13 p.m. EST Mary K. Brunskill - AHN News Writer Los Angeles, CA (AHN) - Paramount/Dreamworks has announced "Transformers," an upcoming movie directed by Michael Bay and executive produced by Steven Spielberg, will be opening earlier than planned. Although the film was initially slated to open July 4, it will now be in wide release July 3, with special screenings in select theaters on July 2. "Transformers" is based around the robot toy line launched by Hasbro in 1984. The toy line was centered around two groups of robots, each of which had its own leader: Optimus Prime, who believes in the sanctity of life, and Megatron, who believes in survival of the fittest and is out to destroy biological life.

She calls fame a drug - what is her excuse. She uses her loud mouth and obnoxious critisms to gain her publicity. The question is - who cares what she thinks or what she has to say - she is just a person after all, like everyone else, except louder and meaner. Jun 4th, 2007 - 19:57:24 I'm one of those who cares about what she has to say. Not because her words are more important than those of others, but because of the significance and importance of her actions. Obviously, being loud and mean about this monstrosity of a war is not good enough for the world continues down the path of chaos perpetrated by childish and fraudulent political games. We should all be crying foul, a billion times louder and meaner than Rosie O'Donnell! I don't doubt that Rosie O'Donnell has room for improvement on some of her idiosyncrasies, but we all have them; hers are just more apparent because she is in the public life. To those much has been given, much is expected, and I for one am glad she's using her 'fame' to awaken the sheep more than to dumb them down!

This divorce could break up records find it fast: search metromix.com find things to do 4,000 Chicago bars and clubs. This divorce could break up records Splitting mega-rich couple's assets equally could be a first In one of the largest contested divorces ever, a Chicago energy industry magnate is fighting to overturn a judge's ruling that would give half of his fortune -- or about $176 million -- to his wife. The case pits Michael Polsky, 57, chief executive of Invenergy LLC, against Maya Polsky, 55, who was primarily a homemaker during the couple's 31-year marriage. In a two-month trial last year, lawyers for Michael Polsky argued that it was he who built the couple's amazing wealth after they emigrated from Russia in the 1970s with only about $500 to their names. But Maya Polsky's attorneys contend that she has been her husband's trusted confidant through tough times and should be considered a full partner in his success. In October, Cook County Circuit Judge William Boyd sided with Maya Polsky, but both sides filed post-trial motions that put the final result in doubt. Boyd is expected to rule Monday and could increase or decrease the award at that time. The case is "remarkable and historic" for the size of the award and for the judge's decision to split the enormous estate equally between a breadwinning and homemaking spouse, said David Meyer, a law professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "Those are huge numbers," Meyer said. "When you get these cases of extraordinary wealth, it really puts to the test this notion of marriage as a complete partnership." Judges have long split marital estates equally in working-class and middle-class divorces. But as recently as a decade ago, that result was virtually unheard of in mega-divorces, experts said. In 1997, Lorna Wendt, the ex-wife of a former General Electric executive, made headlines merely by asking a Connecticut judge for half of Gary Wendt's fortune. A judge awarded her less than she sought, but still about $20 million. Likely a new high for Illinois Though no one tracks the outcome of every divorce trial, Meyer and other experts suspect the award to Maya Polsky -- if it stands -- would be a record in Illinois. Gaetano Ferro, president of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers, said he knew of no bigger award nationally. Lawyers for Michael and Maya Polsky declined to comment about the case. But court documents show the couple's remarkable journey to the ranks of the super-rich. The Polskys married in 1975 in Kiev, Ukraine, which then was part of the Soviet Union. Michael was an engineer and Maya taught English, but they left their jobs and families to seek a better life. "It was the classic Soviet Union situation -- very political, no freedoms, no opportunities," Michael told the Tribune in a 2002 interview. The couple briefly lived in Austria and Italy. When they arrived in Detroit in 1976, they had only four suitcases and $500 in cash, according to court records. Maya was pregnant with the first of their two sons. The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society helped Michael get an engineering job in Ann Arbor, Mich. The Polskys moved to Chicago in 1980 and Michael began his rise in the energy business. He worked for an engineering firm, then in 1985, co-founded a power equipment company. In 1991, Michael founded the company that eventually would become Northbrook-based SkyGen Energy, a leading independent power producer. The company prospered and in 2000, Michael and a Wisconsin-based energy company sold SkyGen for about $450 million. Along the way, Michael received an MBA from the University of Chicago. He later would donate $7 million to the school to help establish the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship. Maya was a homemaker and mother, but she supported her husband at every turn, her lawyer Howard Rosenfeld argued last year in court filings. "They would walk together after dinners, and Michael would share details of his work, looking for empathy, advice or merely an open ear," Rosenfeld wrote. "For many years, their marital partnership flourished. Michael provided sustenance and security, and Maya provided love, support, advice and counsel." In 2002, however, the couple separated. Maya filed for divorce the next year, citing irreconcilable differences. At the high-stakes divorce trial last fall, it fell to Boyd to determine the value of the couple's possessions and decide how to split the marital estate. Each side brought in experts to testify about the value of art, jewelry, homes, real estate and other investments. The trial lasted two months, off and on, with much of the time spent debating proper value for Michael's newest company, Invenergy. Michael's expert said the firm was worth $24.7 million, according to court records. But in a key win for Maya, the judge rejected that expert's methods, saying they "appeared contrived to produce the lowest value possible." Siding with Maya, Boyd valued the company at $75 million. The even bigger issue was a legal one: How to compare Maya's contributions to the marriage as a homemaker with her husband's enormous financial success? As in most states, Illinois law provides judges with no hard and fast rules regarding how to split marital assets. The state statute tells judges to consider certain factors, but leaves it to each judge to decide how much weight each factor deserves. In the Polsky divorce, Maya's lawyers argued that the duration of the couple's marriage was the key factor. Michael's lawyers urged Boyd to consider each spouse's financial contribution to the marriage. Homes, art split up In a 25-page opinion in October, Boyd concluded that the couple should share the estate equally, but he provided few details about how he reached that result. Under Boyd's decision, Michael got the couple's $7 million home in Aspen, Colo., $2.9 million residence in Chicago and $2.1 million home in East Troy, Wis. Maya received the couple's $2 million home in Glencoe and $3.7 million home on Lake Shore Drive. She also gets various investments and cash and keeps the Maya Polsky Gallery, valued at $305,000. Boyd also divided millions more in paintings, jewelry, rugs and other home furnishings. Now both sides want Boyd to reconsider his ruling. "The extraordinary marital estate in this case was built solely by Michael's skill, genius and drive," Joseph Tighe, Michael's attorney, wrote in court filings. "This court's 50-50 division of assets reflects a fundamental error of law and must be set aside." Meanwhile, Maya's attorneys contend that she should get more than 50 percent of the estate, in part because Michael has more earning power that she does in the future. Boyd's final ruling will be watched by family lawyers in Illinois, Meyer said, as will the virtually inevitable appeal. That an estate so large could be split equally illustrates how much the legal landscape has changed since the 1980s and even 1990s, Meyer said. "How hard is it to settle a case when you're dividing $300 million or $400 million?" Ferro said. "The only reason you try those cases is if somebody gets stuck on a principle. ... If you're hung up on the divorce really being vindication -- proof that you contributed the same, or that you contributed more -- you go to war." Copyright & terms of service

http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/04/ap3783690.html&cid Paris Hilton Checks Into L.A. Jail - Forbes.com Paris Hilton Checks Into L.A. Jail 06.04.07, 6:45 AM ET Hours after strolling the red carpet in a strapless black dress, Paris Hilton traded her designer duds for a jail-issued jumpsuit. The 26-year-old heiress checked into the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood just after 11:30 p.m. Sunday. She's expected to serve three-weeks for violating her probation in an alcohol-related reckless driving case. Hilton surrendered to sheriff's deputies after making a surprise visit to the MTV Movie Awards in the afternoon. "I am trying to be strong right now," she told reporters on the red carpet. "I'm ready to face my sentence. Even though this is a really hard time, I have my family, my friends and my fans to support me, and that's really helpful." Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said Hilton was easy to work with. "Her demeanor was helpful. She was focused, she was cooperative," he said. Hilton turned herself in at the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles just after 10:30 p.m., then was escorted to the all women's facility in Lynwood, where she was booked, fingerprinted and issued a jail uniform, Whitmore said. She also was given her first meal: cereal, bread and juice. So far, Hilton does not have a cellmate, Whitmore said. The "Simple Life" star will be housed in the "special needs" unit of the 13-year-old jail, separate from most of its 2,200 inmates. The unit contains 12 two-person cells reserved for police officers, public officials, celebrities and other high-profile inmates. Like other inmates in that unit, Hilton will take her meals in her cell and will be allowed outside the 12-foot-by-8-foot space for at least an hour each day to shower, watch TV in the day room, participate in outdoor recreation or talk on the telephone. No cell phones or BlackBerrys are permitted in the facility, even for visitors. The jail, a two-story concrete building next to train tracks and beneath a bustling freeway, has been an all-female facility since March 2006. It's located in an industrial area about five miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. "I did have a choice to go to a pay jail," Hilton said Sunday, without giving details. "But I declined because I feel like the media portrays me in a way that I'm not and that's why I wanted to go to county, to show that I can do it and I'm going to be treated like everyone else. I'm going to do the time, I'm going to do it the right way." When she was sentenced May 4, Superior Court Judge Michael T. Sauer ruled that she would not be allowed any work release, furloughs or use of an alternative jail or electronic monitoring in lieu of jail. Sometimes stars are allowed to do their time in a jail of their choosing. In such cases they pay a daily room-and-board fee to the smaller jails, which afford them more privacy and comfort. Cop-slapping actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, for example, served three days behind bars in 1990 at the El Segundo jail near the Los Angeles International Airport. She paid $85 a day. On Saturday, about 15 photographers, reporters and television crews staked out the entrances to the jail waiting for the celebutante's arrival. Authorities had also cordoned off a grassy area outside the facility for the media. She had until Tuesday to report. On Sunday, about a dozen photographers and television crews were at the Lynwood facility when she arrived in an unmarked SUV. Video captured by celebrity news site TMZ.com showed Hilton inside the vehicle with her mother, Kathy. Hilton's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said he spoke with Kathy Hilton after she returned from the jail. "She told me it was very emotional," Mintz said. "She also said that she feels this will be a time when Paris will be able to think and reflect and to spend time alone to learn from the experience because in Paris' life she's never alone - there's always a constant chatter around her." Officers arrested Hilton in Hollywood on Sept. 7. In January, she pleaded no contest to the reckless-driving charge and was sentenced to 36 months' probation, alcohol education and $1,500 in fines. She was pulled over by California Highway Patrol on Jan. 15. Officers informed Hilton she was driving on a suspended license and she signed a document acknowledging she was not to drive. She then was pulled over by sheriff's deputies on Feb. 27, at which time she was charged with violating her probation. Associated Press Writer Peter Prengaman contributed to this report.

The energetic Laura Bell Bundy has the lead role in the slick but safe "Legally Blonde," based on the 2001 Reese Witherspoon film about an atypical Harvard Law coed. NEW YORK CITY &#8212; The short version of New York's most-promising new trend: Several refreshingly gutsy, nonformulaic musicals quietly sneaked into Broadway berths this season. And now they are raising a racket. "Spring Awakening" and "Grey Gardens" are musical dramas of substance and bite. And if their box-office prospects are iffy, the pair have stayed put long enough to rake in a lion's share of Tony Award nominations (the awards will be handed out next Sunday and broadcast by CBS), and cast a strong vote for more Broadway musicals that break the mold. Maybe it's not so surprising. The jukebox musical craze is cooling, as evidenced by Twyla Tharp's recent, short-lived "The Times They Are A-Changin'," a harshly panned tuner based on Bob Dylan songs. The British/French pop-opera invasion is having only a singular, tepid resurgence with "The Pirate Queen" (scored by "Miss Saigon" creators Alain Boublil and Claude-Michel Sch&#246;nberg). Sure, the craze for splashy new musicals geared toward youth and based on Hollywood movie comedies (the new "Legally Blonde") and Disney kid-flicks ("Tarzan," "Mary Poppins") is going strong. But "serious" new tuners on the Great White Way (like such admirable earlier exemplars as "Caroline, Or Change" and "The Light on the Piazza") may help carve out a permanent niche for admirable experimentation &#8212; and much-appreciated variety. The 61st Annual Tony Awards will be broadcast at 8 p.m. June 10 on KIRO-7. Read Misha Berson's Tony preview next Sunday. Here is a closer look at the upstarts &#8212; and a peek at a sign-of-the-times, crowd-pleasing Off Broadway attraction. Erotically charged and bitterly audacious, Frank Wedekind's play shocked Europe in its 1891 premiere for its daring study of sexual repression and hypocrisy in provincial Germany. The young lovers who couple and crash in Wedekind's script are resurrected in a combustible new musical, which has nabbed 11 Tony nominations, the most for any show in Broadway's 2006-07 season. The shock value of the graphic coming-of-age tale invented by Wedekind, and faithfully adapted for the stage by Steven Sater, has diminished. But the ill-fated romance of two ferociously sensitive, lusty (and sexually clueless) adolescents, Melchior (Jonathan Groff) and Wendla (Lea Michele), still resonates in a nation where sex education is a matter of fierce debate &#8212; and teen suicide and violence are persistent concerns. No question that the uptight parents and teachers who preach conformity and abstinence are the heavies in this spree of raw, unruly adolescent frustration. More individualized are the kids, played mostly by Broadway novices who tear up the stage in Michael Mayer's propulsive production. They stomp and stamp through the rousing choreography by the great Bill T. Jones. They sing out, strong and true, the compelling punk-folk-rock score, composed by singer-songwriter Duncan Sheik with lyrics by Sater. Mainstreaming alt-contemporary and Brechtian ensemble techniques that are increasingly common now on Broadway, "Spring Awakening" welds its gifted young crew into an inspired mass of angst. Individual characters pop into focus when they grab a mic, stare into the crowd and whoop out anguished rockers ("Bitch of Living"), searching soliloquies ("Mama Who Bore Me"), and intertwining duets ("The Guilty Ones"). Is "Spring Awakening" the new "Rent," as some suggest? There are certainly parallels, in spirit and form, between the two shows. But "Spring Awakening" has no instant standard in its score, like Rent's "Seasons of Love," and its rawness is a more radical departure from Broadway musical conventions. And in terms of pathos, "Rent," for me, was more affecting in its group portrait of young adult bohemians facing AIDS in lower Manhattan during the 1980s. "Spring Awakening" is edgier and more distancing but also (ironically) more contemporary, as it hooks into the eternal, hormone-driven whirlwind of puberty &#8212; which there will likely never be a cure for. This gets my vote for the weirdest, most subversive musical on Broadway, and the unlikeliest to land there. Doug Wright's book for the show, based on the lives of world-class eccentrics (and Jacqueline Onassis relations) Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter "Little Edie," is sharply bifurcated. Act 1 presents a perverse twist on a Noel Cowardesque drawing-room romantic comedy, in which moneyed, colorful gentry sip champagne and swap witticisms in a country manse. Act 2 swerves into a grotesque fable, a kind of hybrid of "Mommy Dearest" and "Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?" set to music. What happened to Edith and Little Edie was documented in the cult documentary film "Grey Gardens," set amid the squalor this joined-at-the-hip pair were living in when the filmmaking brothers Albert and David Maysles turned their cameras on them. In a brilliant twofer performance, Christine Ebersole portrays both of the show's antiheroines in turn. She is a deceptively glossy, but truly unhinged Edith, the 1941 high-society wife threatened by the beauty and talent of daughter Edie (Erin Davie). And flashing forward to 1973, Ebersole eerily morphs into a pathetic yet strangely valiant middle-aged Edie &#8212; still in the clutches of Big Edie (played by the marvelous Mary Louise Wilson in Act 2) &#8212; and now mad as a hatter herself. The Scott Frankel-Michael Korie score is adept and lush in its use of past Broadway idioms. And Allen Moyer's dual scenic design, which displays the Beales' East Hampton fortunes from riches to ruin, is tops. But it is Ebersole's uncanny ability to turn us into both gawking voyeurs and caring confidants that makes the show so disturbing. In Little Edie's bizarrely dressed, fitfully hopeful and trapped state, we see just how warped the American Dream can get, and how low "high society" can plunge &#8212; Kennedy connection, or not. There is less to say about this frothy stage treatment of the hit Reese Witherspoon movie about a ditzy airhead who discovers she has a legal-eagle brain and a moral backbone while trying to prove herself to a boyfriend who is so not worth it. With serviceable songs by Laurence O'Keefe and Nell Benjamin; lots of perky dancing devised by director-choreographer Jerry Mitchell; and a likable-enough cast headed by the highly energetic Laura Bell Bundy, "Legally Blonde" is expertly put together and executed. It also is a feat of engineering over inspiration, and about as substantial as a cone of pink cotton candy. Accessorized with a lot of second-generation Valley Girl jokes, Gregg Barnes' witty costuming and a blaring message about tolerance and girl power, "Legally Blonde" is a high-end sports car compared to the messier, riskier new musical vehicles on Broadway. A great many parents will bring their pubescent girls to this show, rather than risk a more provocative, uncertain encounter with "Spring Awakening" or "Grey Gardens." No harm in that &#8212; but no adventure either. This ebullient outing by the generously gifted writer-composer-star Lin-Manuel Miranda brings something new and hot to Off Broadway. The title refers to Washington Heights &#8212; a largely Latino, upper Manhattan neighborhood. And a sense of that district's vibrant street life and ethnic pride radiates throughout Miranda's folksy musical about the challenges of Latino Americans trying to make their own life choices while honoring hard-working immigrant elders. The annals of New York theater are filled with such cross-generational sagas. What soars highest in "In the Heights" is its spunk, and its score laced with cogent, articulate rap numbers and zesty salsa tunes. Broadway has rarely embraced either rap or Latino music. But judging from the gusto and accessibility of Miranda's piquant show, and the raved-about new Off Broadway rap and rock musical "Passing Strange," maybe it's time.

The move came less than a week after it hired the independent producer Ben Silverman as a co-chairman, with Marc Graboff, of the television group, with authority over both the entertainment division of the NBC network and the television studio. That appointment, which coincided with the removal of Kevin Reilly as president of NBC Entertainment, raised questions about the future of Ms. Pope, who had been the top program development executive for NBC and was one of the most highly regarded young executives at the network. But NBC Universal acted quickly to answer those questions by giving Ms. Pope authority over the studio, which is producing hit shows like Heroes and The Office for NBC and House for Fox. Ms. Pope, who is in her mid-30s, will succeed Angela Bromstad, who headed the studio before she stepped away from the job several months ago. Ms. Bromstad is expected to be appointed to another NBC Universal position, perhaps heading its international division in London. Ms. Pope said in a telephone interview yesterday that she expected to hit the ground running in her new position, speaking to writers and producers and instigating new programs as quickly as possible. She said she has been impressed by Mr. Silvermans passion and vision. Hes like a hurricane of energy and ideas, she said. The studio will take risks both monetarily and creatively, Ms. Pope said. Asked what that might entail, she said she would encourage writers to bring new ideas and would give them latitude in carrying out those ideas. The studio hopes to commission pilots as early as this summer, she said. NBC continues to trail the other broadcast networks and needs hit programs. Ms Pope said she saw the studio as having two clients, the writers and NBC. Beyond the quest for a new generation of hits, Ms. Pope said she and Mr. Silverman had discussed the larger questions of where the business is going. That, she said, means thinking about new ideas, new avenues of distribution and the necessity to think globally about our content. Next Article in Business (17 of 20) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

When the focus finally turned to movies, MTV's irreverent mix of honours included prizes for Best Kiss, Best Fight and Best Villain. Jack Nicholson was the winning villain, capturing the Golden Popcorn trophy for his mobster role in . The fight prize went to Gerard Butler, who battled "The Uber Immortal" in the epic . Will Ferrell and Sacha Baron Cohen won Best Kiss for their smooch in Talladega Nights: The Battle of Ricky Bobby . They reprised the moment after accepting their award, culminating in a roll-around-on-the-floor makeout session. Cohen also won a Golden Popcorn for Best Comedic Performance for his role in Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan "Unfortunately, Borat can't be here tonight," Cohen joked. "He's been feeling the pressures of fame and had to check himself into rehab." In another light moment, Canadian comic Mike Myers took the stage to accept his MTV Generation Award, honouring his body of work, with an Austin Powers-style dance number. The live program was punctuated by a performance by Rihanna and Jay Z, who paired up on her new song "Umbrella." Despite striking out with critics, Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest did well, claiming Best Movie and Best Performance for star Johnny Depp. Jaden Smith took Best Breakthrough Performance for co-starring with dad Will in The Pursuit of Happyness was declared Best Summer Movie You Haven't Seen.

People laugh at this stuff because they're uncomfortable, not because it's funny. Once a well known comedian told me 'Anyone can get a laugh with a 'penis' joke. Anyone'. I worked at a Comedy Club for over three years and saw almost every 'Name' perform for a week. Larry Miller killed each and every time. Not one crude joke and not one piece of blue material. When you're really funny, you don't need the trash that Ms. Sliverman spews. I'm willing to be that she couldn't get a laugh without it.

Increasingly, the Sundance Institute Theatre Lab, based in Utah and sponsor of workshop retreats in Utah, Florida and Wyoming, is popping up as one of those important rest stops where new work is nurtured. Among past Broadway shows that have enjoyed Sundance development are 2004 Best Play Tony Award winner I Am My Own Wife and 2005 Best Musical nominee The Light in the Piazza. The 2007 Best Musical nominees both benefited from time with Sundance: was at the 2001 Sundance Institute Theatre Lab in Sundance, UT, and was at the 2005 Sundance Theatre Lab at White Oak in Yulee, FL. (A third Institute retreat, for playwrights, is held on the Ucross Foundation's ranch in Wyoming.) Michael Mayer, the Tony-nominated director of , said that "time" was the greatest gift that Sundance gave his project. He also appreciated that it was away from critics, away from New York and was all about process. The Sundance summer lab is in the Utah mountains, where artists can almost touch the sky. team learn at Sundance in balmy Florida? "Amazing things," said Tony-nominated director Michael Greif. "With the lab, we were able to cast a two-week workshop with most of the people who are still in the company, so Sundance and their casting directors had a lot to do with getting us here." The atmosphere at White Oak  a Florida plantation, again far from New York  was inspirational, Greif said. "The most amazing thing that happened at Sundance was that [2007 Tony Award nominees] Christine [Ebersole] and Mary Louise [Wilson] started inspiring [Tony-nominated composer] Scott [Frankel] and [Tony-nominated lyricist] Michael [Korie] to write amazing material," Greif explained. "Michael wrote the lyrics to 'Another Winter in a Summer Town' while we were at Sundance; Scott and Michael wrote 'Around the World' while we were at Sundance. 'Another Winter' was first performed as a poem. Christine it  it was truly extraordinary." It was at the Sundance White Oak Lab that Tony-nominated librettist Doug Wright "found a way to create a structure for the second act based on the musical material," Greif said. Act One of the musical is an imagined day in the life of the high society Beale Family in 1941 East Hampton, Long Island  very "Philip Barry," Greif said. Act Two borrows more from the "Grey Gardens" film documentary that inspired the musical. The vibrant mother and daughter of Act One are now dissipated, emotionally strained and living in the same mansion, but it's in shambles. Very "Samuel Beckett," Greif observed of Act Two. Greif explained, "Doug said to Scott and Michael, 'We know what the material is  what the documentary is  begin writing the stuff that inspires you.' And then Doug started finding a way in which we could travel through a day, a year, a lifetime in that [second] act, connecting those musical anchors." The entire show was not complete at Sundance, Greif said, but "in the time we were there, we actually read through and staged the first act and made some very significant changes to the first act."

Cook County Circuit Judge William Boyd upheld the award--which is half of industry magnate Michael Polsky's fortune--to his former wife of more than 30 years, Maya Polsky. Howard Rosenfeld , the attorney for Maya Polsky, said this is the largest divorce verdict in the history of Illinois and could be the largest in the country. Lawyers for Michael Polsky will likely appeal the decision. Michael Polsky, 57, is chief executive of Invenergy LLC. His 55-year-old wife was mostly a stay-at-home mother durring their 31-year marriage. In 2002, the couple separated. Maya filed for divorce the next year, citing irreconcilable differences. The couple emigrated from Russia in the mid-1970s. They settled in Chicago in the 1980s and Michael Polsky built his fortune after founding Inverergy in the early 1990s. Maya Polsky's attorneys contend she should be considered a full partner her ex-husband's success. State law provides judges with no clear rules on how to divide marital assets. Maya's lawyers argued that the length of the couple's marriage was the key factor. Michael's lawyers urged Boyd to consider each spouse's financial contribution to the marriage.

Staff Reporter / spatterson@suntimes.com A Cook County judge this morning awarded what could be the largest divorce verdict in U.S. history, ruling that energy industry magnate Michael Polsky must pay his wife, Maya Polsky, $184 million. Michael Polsky's lawyers had asked Judge William Boyd to reconsider his initial judgment last year and reduce the award. Instead, Boyd raised the amount that Maya Polsky, 55, will get in the divorce  from the original $176 million to $184 million, according to her attorney, Howard Rosenfeld. Rosenfeld said he knows of no other verdict this big in U.S. divorce courts. The couple was married for 31 years. The Polskys emigrated from Russia with nothing more than 30 years ago. Trained as an engineer, Michael Polsky made his fortune in the energy business. He now heads Invenergy LLC. As he built the business, his wife raised their children. They ultimately had homes in Chicago, Glencoe, Wisconsin and Colorado, while, in recent years, Maya Polsky also opened the Maya Polsky Gallery. The award amounts to about a 50/50 split of the couple's assets, Rosenfeld said. He said that was fair, no matter how much money that comes to. Michael Polsky's lawyer unsuccessfully argued otherwise. "She was not a driving force of the business," attorney Joseph Tighe said. "We don't think the judge's decision gives proper considerations to the contributions of a spouse in the development of the estate." Make Us Your Home Page © Copyright 2007 Sun-Times News Group |

NEW YORK - Sunday night, Paris Hilton, a woman known for her love of the media and the paparazzi, managed to sneak practically undetected into the Los Angeles County Jail where she will be serving her 23 day sentence. Monday morning on âThe View,â Barbara Walters revealed how the heiress avoided a media circus and snuck into the Lynwood detention center. Walters said she spoke to Paris and her mother Kathy Hilton last night and they informed her of their plans. âI talked to her mother and I talked to Paris,â Barbara said. âShe went to the MTV Awards and then she stayed a while and then she left. Everyone thought she was gonna go to parties (but) she went to her grandfatherâs house.â Walters said Paris snuck out the back gate of the home while her sister Nicky Hilton helped divert the media by wearing a blonde wig. âShe was taken to an underground tunnel,â Walters added. Paris confided in Walters that she expects the jail sentence to affect her deeply. Photo gallery: Parisâ court dates Photo gallery: Paris! Britney! Lindsay!

Christine Ebersole's triumphant odyssey find it fast: search metromix.com find things to do 4,000 Chicago bars and clubs. Christine Ebersole's triumphant odyssey Special to the Tribune She's the toast of Broadway right now; the odds-on favorite to win the best actress Tony award June 10 for the musical "Grey Gardens." And Christine Ebersole is savoring her moment, not so much for the nightly standing ovations or the sweet success that has come to a 54-year-old actress who has overpaid her dues, but because Ebersole nearly single-handedly propelled a tough-to-categorize show from off-Broadway onto the big stage and into the position to reap accolades. "I never doubted the show would succeed &#091;on Broadway&#093;," Ebersole says. "My belief in it was so strong, I knew we had to find some way to plug into those that believed and not try to convince those that didn't." Ebersole has just finished a Tony Awards rehearsal at Radio City Music Hall (she'll sing a number from "Grey Gardens" at the ceremony) and now, settling into her dressing room backstage at the Walter Kerr Theater, she's squeezing interviews, photo shoots and a much-needed nap into the precious hours before the curtain goes up at 8. Even some members of the creative team behind "Grey Gardens" -- Pulitzer prize-winning writer Doug Wright, lyricist Michael Korie and composer Scott Frankel -- weren't convinced the quirky musical based on the 1975 cult classic documentary had the "legs" for a an expensive Broadway run. After its debut at Playwrights Horizons off-Broadway, where the show earned mixed reviews (except for the performances by Ebersole and Mary Louise Wilson, which won raves), Ebersole campaigned to get it produced in a Broadway theater. "I had to just get everybody on board," she says. "I told them, 'don't listen to the noise. Don't listen to the statistics. We just have to believe in its worth.' When I got half a million dollars on the table, I called a meeting with Playwrights Horizons, and I told them, either we do what it takes to get this show to Broadway or I'm letting it go." Her pale blue eyes well up, in an overwhelmed, not overly dramatic way, as she talks of sitting in the theater as the Tony nominees were announced and "Grey Gardens" earned a whopping 10, including best musical. "Seeing all our names -- it blew me away because I believed in it. I've won already, just to get to this place, this moment of recognition. It is a testament of faith," she says. It wasn't always so for the Winnetka-born Ebsersole, who still has family in the Chicago area: a brother in Glen Ellyn and a sister in Ft. Sheridan. She attended MacMurray College in Jacksonville for two years before a theater professor told her to get to New York. At 20, she was waiting on tables in Manhattan; two years later, she got her first job -- on Broadway in the play "Angel Street" ("The producer had to buy my equity card," she says.) She continued to land roles that made good use of her trained voice, from co-starring with Richard Burton and Richard Harris in a revival of "Camelot" to matching wits with Kevin Kline in "On the Twentieth Century." Despite "the amazing family of show business" she had so easily fallen into, Ebersole decided to make the break for Los Angeles and cultivate her television and film career, one that began with her single, rather forgettable season (1981-82) as a regular cast member of "Saturday Night Live." Born for the stage Her big-screen resume is long and varied ("it's been a kaleidoscope kind of career") with the peaks ("Tootsie") and valleys ("Ghost Dad") of any journeyman actor. But Ebersole never really found her niche in L.A. Tall and fair -- in person she resembles actresses Joan Allen and Jessica Lange -- Ebersole's musical and dramatic skills perhaps couldn't be contained anywhere else but the stage. So, six years ago, Ebersole decided to return to New York (she lives in Maplewood, N.J., with her husband &#091;Bill Moloney&#093;, mother, three kids and many pets). The move agreed with her, and Ebersole found success back on Broadway, playing the hostess in "Dinner at Eight" ("I love that show; I wanted to do it forever") and winning the Tony in 2001 for the revival of "42nd Street." But in the dual role of Edith and Edie Bouvier Beale, the socialites turned recluses who spend their days indulging in music, memories and regrets, she found "the role of a lifetime." "It is the most demanding role I've ever done. Oh, God, yes," she says, running her hand over her face and through her hair. "I'm always on stage." Both roles require different but equally strong singing voices. By act two, in which Ebersole plays the more showy part of "Little" Edie, the first cousin of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, the show's intense themes of "devotion, loyalty, responsibility, non-conformity and freedom" is at full throttle. One would have to feel somewhat youthful to be the mother of three children under 10. "That's what keeps it real and keeps me sane," she says. "But it's a terrible sacrifice; that's the worst part of doing a Broadway show. I'm never home to tuck them in at night. They don't want to see &#091;"Grey Gardens"&#093;. It's what takes me away from them and they don't like it. Neither do I." Mothering adopted children is one thing she shares with friend Rosie O'Donnell; the other is a love of the Broadway stage. Rosie routinely talked up "Grey Gardens" and Ebersole's performance, along with many others, daily on "The View." "That's the worst part of her leaving &#091;"The View"&#093;. She was our one Broadway advocate," Ebersole says. "She was the only person on TV who talked about Broadway." At the Walter Kerr Theater, the well-wishers streaming backstage night after night include not just celebrities, but the visitors who remember Ebersole from grade school and high school. "They're people I haven't seen, literally, since I was 16," she says. "It's amazing and wonderful." Ebersole will attend the Tony Awards with her husband, and very likely tear up as the multiple nominations for "Grey Gardens" are announced. Regardless of who wins, it is her personal triumph, she says, "for being on my purpose, the purpose of work -- and the universe has responded in kind." Copyright & terms of service

Actor Perry Caravello claims he was severely injured when the trap went off while he was appearing on a talk-radio show with Knoxville. He says in the suit that Knoxville had agreed to pay him more than $10million for the stunt. Image search: Johnny Knoxville Caravello filed legal documents in Los Angeles Superior Court, alleging fraud and negligence. Carvello is also fuming mad that the stunt was videotaped without his permission and spread over the internet, according to court documents. In addition he is seeking payment for a low-budget comedy movie, , that he appeared in and which he had appeared on the radio show to promote. US talk-show host Jimmy Kimmell, comic Don Barris and radio show host Adam Carolla are also named as defendants. The documents state: "On or about September 27, 2006, Plaintiff appeared on the Adam Corolla radio show as part of the promotion of the release of the DVD sales of "Plaintiff was promised by Defendant Johnny Knoxville that Plaintiff would be paid (US)$10 million dollars if he placed his penis in a mousetrap. "Plaintiff agreed to do so and much to his emotional tranquility and physical harm, was severely injured when the trap literally went on his manhood. "As a direct, proximate result thereof, Plaintiff had to seek out medical assistance for said injuries, pain and humiliation. "The aforementioned incident has without Plaintiff's permission and consent been widely disseminated and circulated on the Internet, to his prejudice, humiliation and emotional trauma. "The named defendants did nothing to prevent the incident from happening at the radio studio and actually filmed the event without his permission or consent." The lawsuit states that Carvello suffered "emotional trauma" as a result of what he calls the "assault and battery." The documents also show Caravello is suing Adam Carolla, the radio show host, station KLSX-FM (97.1), talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and comic Don Barris. Caravello had appeared on the radio show with Carolla and Knoxville in September to promote DVD sales of the 2003 television movie , which starred the plaintiff, the lawsuit stated. Kimmel is being sued because he and Caravello had entered a contract for the plaintiff to receive money from DVD sales and to be involved in sequels to the film, but so far Caravello has not been paid, the lawsuit stated. Barris was named because he allegedly assaulted Caravello without provocation shortly before the actor made a scheduled appearance on the US talk show, " Send us your news tips, stories, photos and videos Hilton behind bars after red carpet walk Lohan plays dangerous game with knives Men plead guilty over weird suicide pact Moya wins battle of the golden oldies Aussies to leave UAE after court verdict One in 10 workers use laptops for porn Knoxville sued over genital mousetrap stunt US marine jailed for kidnap deported Bollywood dad inspires son to elope Kangaroo dies after capture in Indiana Three men armed with guns rob two pubs Second man charged over restaurant death Aussies want action on climate: poll Aussie-born Seric walks out on Croatia Woman dies after three-car collision ninemsn's wrap of the latest goss, updated daily.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/03/magazine/03ebersole-t.html&cid Christine Ebersole - Grey Gardens - Theater - New York Times Between a Mother and a Daughter Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: June 3, 2007 It was not your typical schoolyard conversation. Skip to next paragraph Joan Marcus/Associated Press (top); Sara Krulwich/The New York Times Mom! Remember when you were playing that person who broke her leg? And we went to your dressing room and ordered Chinese and watched TV? Well, me and Dylan want to do that and bring two friends. Please? , dressed like the other moms, in a T-shirt, sweat pants and Ugg boots, stood tall as a maypole, looked down at her jumping 9-year-old son, Aron, and his jumping friend, Dylan, and tried not to laugh. No, sweetheart, this dressing room is too small, she said. Small places are funner! We could watch WrestleMania!  I cant commit to that, Ebersole said, starting toward the car, the two boys dogging her, while her 10-year-old daughter, MaeMae, and her friend rolled their eyes and kept their distance. Its too many people; they dont allow it. All four children scrambled into the minivan, and as Ebersole got behind the wheel, a persistent voice piped up from the back. Mom, next time when you go to work, can you ask the person? Please? This time her laugh broke through, as well it might have. Ebersole, who won the for Best Actress in a Musical for the 2001 revival of 42nd Street (playing Dorothy Brock, the person who broke her leg), is the celebrated star this season of the Broadway musical Grey Gardens. The show is based on the 1975 Maysles brothers documentary of the same name about Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter, Edith, known as Little Edie, the aunt and first cousin, respectively, of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis. They ran through their fortune and ended up living in squalor in their raccoon-infested East Hampton home, with 52 cats for company. In the first act, Ebersole plays the middle-aged mother who seemingly sabotages her daughters romances to ensure her lifelong companionship, and in the second act she plays the middle-aged daughter whose battle between ambivalence and devotion to her elderly mother keeps her locked in an eternal childhood. It is an emotionally layered tour de force that has earned her a Tony nomination (the show received 10) and sent critics into paroxysms of ecstasy. It is also a performance so demanding  of the shows 23 numbers, Ebersole sings in 18 of them  that she has called the dual-role assignment my Lear. The idea of four 9-year-old boys watching WrestleMania in her dressing room as she does it is laughable, indeed. But Ebersole wears her acclaim lightly. She doesnt act like a Broadway star, though she certainly looks like one. At 5-foot-9, she commands the stage, and her blue-eyed kewpie-doll face plays pretty and big, every nuance hitting the back of the balcony, right on target. Offstage, its as if someone removed her battery pack. She has a comfortable Midwestern charm and a ready laugh, often aimed at herself. Walking through her town of Maplewood, N.J., before picking up the kids from school, she called everyone by name and hugged the guys behind the counter at the Bagel Chateau. Ebersole was raised in Winnetka, Ill., the swanky Chicago suburb, the youngest of four children whose father was the president of a steel company in Milwaukee. Although she was popular in school, she says she and her family were ideologically out of sync with the towns upper-crust exclusivity; her parents belonged not to the local country club but to the A.C.L.U. Surrounded by , the Ebersoles remained liberal Democrats who idolized the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and opposed the Vietnam War. She felt the difference keenly enough that in the cabaret act she sometimes performs, she still says, Winnetka is an Indian word for affluent gentile.  The familys religion, Unitarian, was also considered offbeat, she recalls. Ebersole grew up to honor the sanctity of all religions and still does. The old guard is represented in her dressing room, packed with Buddhas, prayer candles and crucifixes, with a mezuzah at its entrance; while the New Age dapples her conversation with elaborate descriptions of her psychic dreams and frequent admonitions that every adverse situation is an opportunity for spiritual growth. When she found a scarf lying on the street during a Grey Gardens workshop at Off Broadway, she was convinced it was left there for her by Big and Little Edie (who died in 1977 and 2002, respectively). But if her good-natured chatter can sometimes seem stagy and self-indulgent, you need only look at the womans work ethic to refresh your focus. Even in the theater, where youth is less an obsession than it is in Hollywood, starring roles for middle-aged women  especially of the depth and range of the Beales  are exceedingly rare. Ebersole was so intent on moving Grey Gardens to Broadway that she became one of its producers, spearheading the drive to raise funds. After 42nd Street, she spent three years working mostly Off Broadway and in cabaret, though she was nominated for a Tony Award for a supporting role in the revival of Dinner at Eight at . Grey Gardens was clearly her shot at the big time, and she has risen to the occasion and then some. In the last year, she has made more than 100 appearances, including interviews, to promote the show, regularly sacrificing her weekly day off. She performed at benefits; turned up in the shoe department at Bloomingdales for a charity tie-in; rode in costume on a Grey Gardens float as part of the Gay Pride Parade; and sang at the 85th birthday party of Ben Bradlee, the former executive editor of The Washington Post, who with his wife, the writer Sally Quinn, bought the Grey Gardens house in East Hampton from Little Edie in 1979. Since the musical began playing at the Walter Kerr Theater last October, Ebersole has missed only seven performances  six for illness, one to sing at the nationally televised Honors. When she took a vacation the week before Easter, the shows gross receipts dipped by almost a third. For better or worse, she is the show. That makes it especially hard to be the mother of three children (Elijah, the eldest, is 13), though Ebersole is grateful for the work. After beginning her career in the theater  she played Guenevere to s King Arthur in Camelot on Broadway in 1980  Ebersole went to Hollywood, where she worked constantly, either in small parts in movies, guest roles in TV hits or large parts in television series that never quite made it. When she turned 45, the work dried up; her agent told her she was too old. After playing s older sister (Selleck is 8 years Ebersoles senior) and s mother (Ebersole is 10 years her senior), she had figured that out for herself. But Ebersole, now 54, has never been much for self-pity. After years of trying to become pregnant, she made peace with her infertility and, shunning the punishing regimen of drugs her doctor recommended, adopted her children instead. I finally understood that motherhood is not defined by DNA, she said. Its defined by spirit, really. Thats how family is created. Elijah is half black, half white; MaeMae is Chinese; and Aron, Ebersole says, is everything, including Native American.

And so, for your sanity and ours, weâve decided to kick off a glorious new feature called âComment of the Day,â to provide a transient glimmer of entertainment for all you working stiffs who would much rather be downing margaritas poolside on the Jersey Shore (while fending off advances from married, guidos named Tony) than slaving away in your cubicles. Todayâs âComment of the Dayâ comes to us from , and pertains to the public outcry towards the TB Guy (a.k.a. Andrew Speaker) who had the wanton indecency to risk infecting a bunch of unassuming Americans with a drug-resistant form of Tuberculosis in order to bang his new wife. And while Speaker pleads his case to Diane Sawyer (&#8221;Iâm very sorry for any grief or pain that I have caused anyone&#8221;) not everyone is graciously willing to turn the other cheek. &raquo; Post A Comment Comment Of The Day Live Broadcast + Mark Burnett = MTV Movie Awards Ratings Slide Tucked away at the bottom of about last night&#8217;s MTV Movie Awards, below the chronicling of Paris Hilton&#8217;s red carpet walk and Sacha Baron Cohen&#8217;s kiss with Will Ferrell, is this: The event aired live for the first time in its 16-year history. Ratings have plunged in recent years, with the 2006 event averaging 3.2 million viewers, down from 4.7 million in 2005 and 5.9 million in 2004. So much for the indefatigable Mark Burnett Magic.

It won for best film and for its star Johnny Depp. The awards aired live and had voting from fans. Best Comedic Perormance was awarded to Sacha Baron Cohen for . Best Villain went to Jack Nicholson for playing a ganglord Nicholson and Depp made their first-ever appearance at the ceremony. The night also featured heart-stopping and eye-popping performances by Rihanna, featuring Jay-Z as they performed And making her first-ever live U.S. television debut, British singer/songwriter Amy Winehouse performed Comedian Mike Myers accepted the MTV Generation Award presented by co- star Cameron Diaz. Recognising him for his dynamic career and acting roles that have captured and entertained MTV audiences for years, Myers accepted the award in true comedic fashion, with an ode to Austin Powers and a mojo-induced dance number. Newcomer Jaden Smith accepted his first-ever award show win for Breakthrough Performance, in an over-the-top and side-splitting home video fitting for a kid with superstar parents Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith. As always, the MTV Movie Awards was filled with film parodies including Boratitis with Susan Sarandon, Kevin Spacey, Marilyn Manson raising awareness of the spreading epidemic which finds people unable to stop imitating everyone's favorite Kazakhstani. The awards also invited viewers to take control of the night as MTV rolled out the first-ever "Best Movie Spoof" category where they had the opportunity to submit their own original movie shorts parodying films from the past year. MTV and Yahoo! partnered to launch this interactive website via Yahoo! Movies which explored the convergence of entertainment and technology like never before. In the weeks leading up to the show, fans submitted more than 400 film spoofs and throughout the contest the finalists received over 250,000 votes combined. The Web Wall kept a constant flow of fans in the spotlight and on the stage as Sarah interacted with the viewers at home. While Sarah searched for a presenter for the "Breakthrough Performance" category, she turned to the all- important Web Wall for a viewer to save the day. Under Surveillance and On Demand - MTV.com covered all the action on the carpet and backstage that fans didn't see on TV. There were cameras all over the backstage area -- from green rooms, to dressing rooms -- giving viewers rare glimpses as only MTV could provide. Exclusive interviews with winners and presenters were also available on MTV.com only. This year we did not know a winner until the last possibly minute, as the MTV Movie Awards left the "Best Movie" Category open throughout the show for live voting. Click for Headlines Archives
http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117966192.html%3Fcategoryid%3D14&cid Variety.com - Silverman assembles team Blog: Wilshire & Washington Blog: The Down Low Cynthia Littleton On The Air Variety On The Town Smith: In New York Posted: Sun., Jun. 3, 2007, 2:10pm PT Pope to rule NBC Universal TV Ben Silverman is putting his Peacock programming team in place. NBC's new entertainment co-chair has tapped Katherine Pope to serve as day-to-day head of NBC Universal Television Studio, replacing the exiting Angela Bromstad. On the network side, Teri Weinberg -- who has run scripted programming at Silverman's Reveille banner -- is said to be in line to take over most of Pope's old duties heading up development. Terms of her deal are still being hammered out, but could be in place later this week. Separately, NBC U TV Studio comedy chief Shelley McCrory confirmed over the weekend she is ankling her post, ending a 15-year career at the company. Her departure had been in the works for months, well before Silverman came into the picture. As for Pope, the well-regarded exec widely credited with playing a key role in the development of Peacock hit "Heroes" has been the frontrunner for the studio gig since last Tuesday. That's when NBC U TV Studio co-chair Marc Graboff -- and NBC U prexy-CEO Jeff Zucker -- made it clear they wanted Pope to remain with the company. Silverman then came onboard with the idea after a series of getting-to-know-you phone calls and a two-hour meeting with Pope at NBC's Burbank HQ last week. "I've always admired the work of Katherine Pope," Silverman said. "She is an unbelievable executive." Graboff added that he was "looking forward to (Pope) continuing to grow our very successful studio." Pope had been in her network gig since January 2006, having previously headed drama development at the Peacock studio. While all's well now, Pope's future at the conglom had been in doubt in the days leading up to the Memorial Day weekend after she and Zucker clashed; Zucker apparently had reneged on promises to put Pope in charge of all studio development. In fact, Zucker was negotiating to bring Silverman into the company, with him and Graboff taking oversight of both the studio and the network. Once Graboff and Zucker signaled that Pope was back in their good graces, it became apparent she would take control of the studio (assuming Silverman didn't have any objections). "Jeff Zucker and I have worked together a long time and we have a great relationship. Most of the time we agree, and there are times we don't agree," Pope said of her dust-up with Zucker, noting she was uncomfortable that reports of their disagreement leaked out. "There will probably be many more times we have spirited conversations. But I never want to be a part of the story." Pope -- who's been at NBC in either a studio or network gig since 2000 -- said Silverman had "bowled me over" in their few meetings. "It's not just his enthusiasm, which we all know about, but his absolute specificity in vision, his decisiveness and his ability to give clarity on what he wants." In some ways, Pope's title won't change much. According to multiple sources, the exec has had a key role in the studio side of development for months now, as Bromstad prepared for a long-expected departure. Pope's stepped-up role -- and Bromstad's reduced activity level -- was in part a reflection of the ever-present tension between Bromstad and the now-departed Kevin Reilly. Bromstad is expected to take a new gig heading an international unit for NBC U, relocating to London ( , May 29). Despite the rocky relationship between Bromstad and Reilly, the collaboration produced successful skeins such as "Heroes" and "The Office." Pope said the Peacock studio will continue to focus on producing for the NBC network, with projects for outside nets coming second. "My goal is to have hits on the NBC television network," Pope said. "Not just because I work for the company, but because NBC has a ton of needs. It wouldn't be smart to not try to service those needs." That said, Pope added, "If a talent (or studio exec) is incredibly passionate about a show that's not right for NBC, I want to set it up elsewhere." With McCrory exiting as head of comedy for the studio, Pope already has at least one position to fill. NBC comedy chief Jeff Ingold followed Pope from the studio to the network a couple years back, but he also has a relationship with Silverman through their work on "The Office." Pope said she hoped to move quickly to set her exec team, but noted that there "are a lot of moving parts" at both the network and studio. That includes Weinberg, who's been key in day-to-day production and development of Reveille's "The Office," "The Tudors" and "Ugly Betty." If she does take a position at NBC, Silverman will have to find someone to take over her role as a watchdog for Reveille's interests in those three shows. Weinberg has kept a low profile at Reveille, though Silverman has been careful to share the spotlight with her, often praising Weinberg's role in helping shape his scripted business. As for McCrory, who's been senior VP of comedy series for the studio since 2004, she will leave sometime this week when her contract expires. Despite the timing of her exit, McCrory said she actually told NBC U supremo Jeff Zucker and NBC U TV Studio co-chair Marc Graboff of her intentions to leave back in February. "I've grown up and then some at NBC," McCrory said. "I've worked on extraordinary shows with the best talent in the business. I couldn't have asked for more. "But I thought I should shake it up and have a new adventure before I turn 30," she joked.McCrory leaves a solid track record behind. Since taking over the top comedy job at the studio three years ago, she oversaw production on the successful Thursday laffer "The Office" and helped develop "30 Rock," the most critically hailed frosh comedy of last season. She also had a hand in NBC midseason laffer "The IT Crowd" and "Aliens in America," the new CW laffer that was developed by NBC U but is now being produced elsewhere. Before moving into comedy, McCrory spent four years at the studio as senior VP of primetime series, where she helped develop shows such as "Crossing Jordan." She had previously headed comedy development for the NBC network, where she helped birth Judd Apatow's "Freaks and Geeks." McCrory joined NBC in 1992 as an assistant to Reilly, who at the time worked as VP of drama development at NBC. She rose to VP of primetime series, overseeing production on skeins such as "Friends" and "Providence."

http://www.amny.com/entertainment/ny-etledew5242345jun05,0,3235548.story%3Fcoll%3Dam-ent-headlines&cid Starbucks sweetener: A new McCartney CD - AM New York Mon, Jun 4, 2007 | 5:16 PM New York City Guide New York City Living Guide to Central Park Guide to Prospect Park Letters to the Editor Tell us: Best Promoters Starbucks sweetener: A new McCartney CD There's a lot of noise surrounding Paul McCartney's new album "Memory Almost Full." It's his first for Starbucks' new record label Hear Music, another sign of the deterioration of the major-label system. It's the 64-year-old's first album available for digital download, another sign of the growing strength of Internet distribution. It's also his first album since his messy breakup from his wife, Heather Mills, but those looking for clues about that will be sorely disappointed, since the album was written before their relationship-troubles began. In the end, though, none of that really matters. What does matter is "End of the End," an elegant, poignant new ballad about death that stands among the best of his solo career. "On the day that I die I'd like bells to be rung and songs that were sung to be hung out like blankets that lovers have played on and laid on while listening to songs that were sung," McCartney sings in his sweetest voice atop a beautiful piano melody, while building a case for the afterlife. It's the most direct song in this series about looking back over his life, which also includes the rocking single "Ever Present Past" and the wistful "Vintage Clothes" and "That Was Me." And it makes "Memory Almost Full" - which isn't as strong as 2005's excellent "Chaos and Creation in the Backyard" (Capitol), but still one of his most consistent albums in years - a worthy addition to his historically impressive catalog. . Paul McCartney looks back and moves forward. In stores today. Grade: B+. Though she's only 19 years old, Rihanna is a hitmaker from the old school, when teams of songwriters and producers pulled together to roll out hot singles and new albums with assembly-line precision. And on "Good Girl Gone Bad" (Def Jam), the Barbados native's third album release in less than two years, she finds her groove. Whether it's the epic-sounding, feel-good hip-hop of "Umbrella" with Jay-Z or the playful, edgy pop of "Breakin' Dishes" or the sweet, "Irreplaceable"-ish duet with Ne-Yo, "Hate That I Love You," Rihanna makes them all work with her pretty little voice and lighthearted vocal delivery. She must have learned her lesson from last year's uneven "A Girl Like Me" album and sidestepped all the sappy ballads in favor of upbeat dance numbers, mid-tempo ballads and island-tinged winners such as "Lemme Get That" and "Sell Me Candy." That makes "Good Girl Gone Bad" an album that is easy to listen to without being easy-listening bland, one of those rare pop collections where every song is a potential hit. ("Good Girl Gone Bad," in stores today; Grade: B+) . Chris Cornell goes solo on "Carry On" (Interscope/Suretone) with rock ranging from the Bond movie theme "You Know My Name" to a dirge-like, yowling cover of "Billie Jean"; Dream Theater's "Systematic Chaos" (Roadrunner); Bruce Springsteen and The Sessions Band capture the Pete Seeger tour on "Live in Dublin" (Columbia); O.A.R. captures its most recent tour on "Live from Madison Square Garden" (Atlantic); Country's hottest duo Big & Rich return with "Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace" (Warner Bros.); Marilyn Manson's less-shock, more-rock "Eat Me, Drink Me" (Nothing/Interscope); Daddy Yankee's "El Cartel: The Big Boss" (Interscope); Poison's covers album "Poison'd" (Capitol); a tribute album to June Carter Cash "Anchored in Love" (Dualtone), including Elvis Costello doing "Ring of Fire"; a tribute album to Ella Fitzgerald "We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song" (Verve), including Queen Latifah doing "The Lady Is a Tramp"; and, at long last, the Afghan Whigs' greatest hits album "Unbreakable: A Retrospective 1990-2006" (Rhino), including two new songs from the underappreciated indie-rock masters. SONG(S) OF THE WEEK . Lil Mama is already building a teen audience with her hip-hop-cheerleader ode to that makeup staple "Lip Gloss" (Jive), which could grow into this summer's "Hollaback Girl." But the 17-year-old rapper from East New York is set to make her name with a pair of high-profile remixes. Her rhymes on the remix of Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend" (RCA) cuts the shrieky quotient and raises the hip factor by turning Lavigne into simply the hook singer. On the remix of Rihanna's "Umbrella" (Def Jam), she replaces Jay-Z and manages to hold her own - a sure sign Lil Mama is gonna be something big.

The Kirov-trained ballerina&#39;s work in the arduous first act had been admirably strong and clear. But here -- seemingly impalpable, yet making it clear that she is longing for the Prince as much as he is for her -- Part worked the real ballerina magic of transforming steps into atmosphere and feeling. If only choreographer Kevin McKenzie&#39;s full production had come anywhere near that feat! Set to Tchaikovsky&#39;s enchantment-invoking score, ``The Sleeping Beauty&#39;&#39; has challenged choreographers since Marius Petipa first staged the ballet in St. Petersburg in 1890. Peter Martins&#39;s 1991 version for the New York City Ballet, revived this year, is typical of the speed-it-up and minimize-the-mime jobs that are common today. Counting one-act versions, this is ABT&#39;s sixth go at the story and its third full-length production. It was created by a triumvirate: the company&#39;s artistic director, McKenzie, who has already concocted unsatisfactory versions of the two other great Tchaikovsky ballets, ``Swan Lake&#39;&#39; and ``The Nutcracker,&#39;&#39; abetted by the incomparable, if troubled prima ballerina Gelsey Kirkland and her husband, Michael Chernov. Aside from Part&#39;s glorious performance in the Vision Scene, the production was continually in conflict with itself. It seemed, on one hand, to want desperately to sell tickets to an uncultivated audience -- and its kids. On the other it paid homage to the idea that ``The Sleeping Beauty&#39;&#39; is the lodestone of classical ballet, earnestly recreating chunks of it that have become legend. The minuses are many. Though the production kept most of the segments that people lovingly recall from more traditional versions -- among them, the fairy solos in the Prologue and most of Aurora&#39;s dances at her coming-of-age party, including the Rose Adagio -- even these highlights were interfered with unnecessarily and illogically. Every bit of the newfangled business -- like the Prince&#39;s solo of longing for perfect love - - was indifferently choreographed. The narrative, exquisitely simple, has been crammed with extraneous, sometimes ludicrous, notions. The Lilac Fairy and her retinue intrude on passages to which Petipa never invited them. Whole scenes, here severely curtailed, have lost all their meaning -- notably the Hunting Scene, meant to reveal the Prince&#39;s society and why he leaves it to seek his heart&#39;s desire. The decor is unspeakable. Aiming for country-cottage prettiness, Tony Walton&#39;s scenery is sometimes saccharine, sometimes vulgar, sometimes both at once. Willa Kim&#39;s costumes are for the most part gaudy and overwrought. A few insipid ones only make matters worse with their mistaken concept of gentility. The dancing was generally fine throughout, showing what must have been fastidious coaching on Kirkland&#39;s part. Michelle Wiles, an amazing, no-nonsense technician, took on a softer grace than usual as the Lilac Fairy and tried hard to make her movement say something. Overall, the dancing suffered from rather too much exactitude, but it is sure to relax and bloom with further performance. The most mesmerizing of the soloists was Herman Cornejo as the Bluebird; one could almost sense the powerful, beating wings as he soared. The most disappointing was Martine van Hamel as Carabosse, the wicked fairy responsible for Aurora&#39;s century- long sleep. An unforgettable Lilac Fairy at the height of her career, van Hamel was herself cursed here with new choreography that made her look like a bourgeois harpy in a costume from hell. ``The Sleeping Beauty&#39;&#39; runs through June 9 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Broadway at 65th Street.

Monday, 4th June 2007 Sun 3 Jun 2007 Actor Bill Nighy (L) who played a role of "Davy Jones", a character from "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End", pretends to chew the finger of a man is dressed as Davy Jones before a special premiere in Tokyo May 24, 2007. "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" led the North American box office for a second weekend, while the pregnancy comedy "Knocked Up" opened at a distant No. 2 with better-than-expected sales. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon "Pirates," "Knocked Up" lead U.S. box office LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" led the North American box office for a second weekend, while the new pregnancy comedy "Knocked Up" delivered a surprisingly large bundle of joy. According to studio estimates issued on Sunday, the third instalment in Walt Disney Co.'s buccaneering franchise sold $43.2 million worth of tickets in the three days beginning June 1. Its 10-day total stands at $216.5 million. But the second Pirates film, "Dead Man's Chest" had earned $258 million after the same time last year. Worldwide, the Johnny Depp adventure has earned $625.3 million, and will soon pass the $653 million total of the first Pirates film -- 2003's "The Curse of the Black Pearl." "Dead Man's Chest" topped out at $1.1 billion. "Knocked Up" squeezed out $29.3 million, equivalent to its production budget. The film's distributor, Universal Pictures, had hoped the acclaimed comedy would open in the same $21 million range as director Judd Apatow's previous film, 2005's "The 40-Year-Old Virgin." The Steve Carell comedy went on to make $109 million domestically. The new film stars Katherine Heigl ("Grey's Anatomy") as an entertainment journalist impregnated during a drunken one-night-stand with a slacker, played by Seth Rogen. Exit surveys provided by Universal indicated that 57 percent of the audience was female, and 44 percent were under 30. It is also the best-reviewed wide release so far this year with raves from 92 percent of critics, according to Rotten Tomatoes (http://www.rottentomatoes.com), a Web site that tabulates reviews. Amid a proliferation of family-friendly sequels, the film was "absolutely a breath of fresh air for the target audience," said Nikki Rocco, Universal's president of domestic distribution. Universal, a unit of General Electric Co.'s NBC Universal Inc., has largely been missing in box office action this year. The studio and Carell will return on June 22 with "Evan Almighty," whose reported $175 million budget makes it the costliest comedy of all time. DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc.'s "Shrek the Third" slipped one to No. 3 with $26.7 million, taking its three-week haul to $254.6 million -- about $100 million off the pace of 2004's "Shrek 2." Also new was the Kevin Costner thriller "Mr. Brooks," which opened at No. 4 with $10 million, in line with the modest expectations of its closely held distributor, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Costner plays a man held in high esteem by the community, who is a serial killer and is in turn pursued by a stalker. Critics were scathing, and exit surveys were not good. "Spider-Man 3" fell two places to No. 5 with $7.5 million. The superhero franchise has earned $318.3 million after five weeks. The worldwide total stands at $844 million, surpassing the $821 million haul of 2002's "Spider-Man," the previous record-holder in the franchise. "Spider-Man 2," released in 2004, finished with $784 million worldwide. The series was released by Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp.. (c) Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

Back to Watch with Kristin Blog home Bosses Explain Why--And How--Show Is Ending Since so many of you fans are still frakking reeling from the mind-frakking news that the upcoming fourth season will be the show&rsquo;s last, I thought I&rsquo;d share with you the full exchange that just went down between reporters and executive producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, during a press conference. Read on for the deets on why they decided to announce the end (Damon Lindelof and these guys should really grab a beer sometime&mdash;they have a lot in common!), what&rsquo;s in store for the end, and the status of the spin-off (please oh please) Also, I&rsquo;m going to a event this week (where we&rsquo;ll be shooting the next WWK Vine show on location!), so if you have any questions for the producers or stars, please feel free to email them to me at . All for one and one for all, right? So say we all It&rsquo;s funny to hear the news that this will be Battlestar&rsquo;s last season, because we talked to [Sci Fi Network Vice President] Mark Stern recently and he said it wouldn&rsquo;t be. Why do you think the disconnect on his part? Moore: This is a decision that took some time to arrive at and like all decisions this large, there were a number of questions that we had about it internally. And we all collectively decided when it was time to be definitive about it and that time is now. is so highly rated, was there any pressure from Sci Fi to try and drag it out for a fifth season or beyond? Moore: Well, there was a discussion as to how long it should go on and to their credit, they were very sensitive as to what we wanted to do creatively on the show. It came from David and I approaching them and saying we felt the show had reached its third act and that it&rsquo;s about the resolution of the series and we feel that the storyline is propelling us towards the conclusion. They asked us questions about why we felt that way and they understood the reason and wanted us to think about it for a while and make sure that this is what we wanted to do, but they didn&rsquo;t really fight us on it. They expressed concern that the show might be able to go on longer and that we wanted to make sure we weren&rsquo;t passing up opportunities to continue telling stories with the series and they were very accommodating and when we, David and I, were clear that this is what we definitely wanted, they supported it. Was there a specific moment from last season that trigged the idea for you that it was time to bring the series to a close? Moore: I think it was somewhere around the midpoint of the season when we were working on the story where they discovered the temple and the temple gave Deanna a glimpse of the final five and then that triggered the beacon that&rsquo;s pointing towards Earth. And those events felt like you were promising the audience that you were moving towards revolution and indeed by the end of the season we had taken that moment and had revealed four of the final five cylons. And one of our characters had been to earth and seen it and that was probably the moment when we started feeling that if we don&rsquo;t start paying off ...if we don&rsquo;t really bring...if we don&rsquo;t really reveal the secrets and start moving in that direction you get to a place where you feel like you are jerking off the audience or you&rsquo;re just treading water and we never wanted to be in that position. We always wanted to be striving forward and pushing the show to its limits and not being afraid to move onto the next part of the story. I understand that the first episode of season four will be a two-hour prequel? Eick: It&rsquo;s two episodes that are not really a part of the fourth season and are not connected to the cliffhanger where we ended season three. Essentially, we were approached by home video who expressed an interest in releasing a couple episodes on DVD for domestic and foreign distribution. As we talked about them internally, there was no way to pick up the cliffhanger in that form and we would preserve that for the official beginning of the fourth season. So the way that made the most sense to us was to go back in time. Not before the series began, but back a season or two ago, say, the second season of the series and tell a story then. We found a way to connect the events of that story to thing that&rsquo;s will happen in the fourth season and it sort of sets up things that will happen in season four. And this will air also? Eick: It will air on Sci-Fi channel. I don&rsquo;t have a date for you, but the plan, from what I understand, is to air those on Sci Fi and then released on DVD either the next day or two days later. The extended episodes as we are calling them will be broadcast in the fall and the official start of season four will begin in early &rsquo;08. The relationships of the characters are so important do you think you will have time to bring closure to these relationships: Baltar, Adama, number Six, Roslin? Moore: That is the plan. That is how we approached the storylines as we were breaking them out for the season and the intention is to concentrate on the characters and their relationships and to bring them all to an end point. I don&rsquo;t know if we will resolve every single thing about every single relationship. I think there is value in leaving some things open to the imagination and having somethings that are tantalizing unresolved, but the intention is to move towards what is the final chapter. I read some reports about Lucy Lawless coming back. Can you comment about that? Moore: It&rsquo;s possible. It&rsquo;s in the planning stages...nothing firm. It&rsquo;s one of things we&rsquo;re talking about. Is the show going to be divided up again for season four...is it going to be 10 and 10? Moore: At the moment the network has not set up a definitive schedule yet and I double checked that with them today. All we can say definitively is that the show begins in early &rsquo;08. The whole &lsquo;reaching earth&rsquo; thing is that something on tap for the beginning of the season or the last shot? Moore: I don&rsquo;t want to be that definitive about it, but the show has always been about the search for Earth and I think to end the series without getting to Earth or a version of Earth or something we call Earth or at least someone saying earth would be unsatisfying. So it will definitely figure into this years storyline. There have been talks about as a series and I wanted to find out if that is on the radar anywhere? Moore: We are certainly tremendously excited and enthusiastic on what we are able to develop into a prequel launching point for a new series called Caprica. It would take the stories that we come to discover on Battlestar Galactica and go all the way back to their embryo and the discovery of the technology that will link to the cylons specifically. It&rsquo;s a tremendously arresting idea that was really beautifully executed and we are anxious to have any opportunity to pursue it because we really think it&rsquo;s a special project. Is SciFi still considering or has it passed on it? Eick: I don&rsquo;t think we know the definitive answer for that. It&rsquo;s not on the immediate front burner, but I don&rsquo;t think anyone has said to us that it is definitively dead. And we continue to hope that there will be an opportunity in the forum and a programming need for it. It is certainly something we believe full-heartedly in and think would not only capture the fans, but will open up a whole new audience to this mythology because it&rsquo;s a very different show. Can you talk about any upcoming storylines for the recently revealed four cylons? Moore: You can see from the end of the third season that they are all the same people, that they are still the same characters. They didn&rsquo;t switch over and become robots suddenly. So essentially you are going to see an extension of that initial moment where they try to figure out what this means to them. If they are cylons, when did that begin, what are their true back stories, what are they meant to do, what are they supposed to do, are they dangerous to themselves, are they dangerous to the ship, can they trust the people around them, should they keep the secret only amongst themselves? That&rsquo;s essentially where their storyline is going to pick up. When you plan on wrapping up the series at the end of the fourth season do you plan on keeping it open-ended to do a feature film like &lsquo; or do you want a closed ending? Moore: The plan is to end the show. The plan is to bring us to a definitive conclusion. There are no plans or thoughts in our head really of them doing a follow-on feature or series beyond that. But it&rsquo;s also a thing where you never say never because who knows how we&rsquo;ll feel when we actually write the conclusion. It would be foolish now to say absolutely not but right now the plan is for a definitive plan. Now don&#39;t forget to email me your Qs for the cast and crew to , and I&#39;ll gladly get to as many of them as possible at the big event this week. Thanks.

Rosie O&#39;Donnell has promised at a national book convention that she&#39;ll be publishing what she calls a memoir of the last 12 months later in the year. Although no details of Rosie&#39;s memoirs - probably titled ARRGH! I HATE EVERYONE! - have been made clear, it seems obvious to us that the book will just be a printed version of Rosie O&#39;Donnell&#39;s blog, only without half as many piss-awful videos or rambling, barely-coherent movies of Rosie O&#39;Donnell half-heartedly mumbling along to songs. So not as fun, obviously. By anyone&#39;s standards, Rosie O&#39;Donnell has had a hell of a year. This time 12 months ago Rosie O&#39;Donnell was a washed-up former talkshow host, professional lesbian and world&#39;s most rubbish . But Rosie&#39;s life was transformed when she was invited to anchor , the daytime TV show where women get to screech a barrage of their botched viewpoint at other women who, outraged, would screech back. Rosie O&#39;Donnell was always more of a bellower than a screecher, and the people in charge of didn&#39;t like Rosie&#39;s blog , but aside from that she was a perfect fit for the show. She was in. From then on Rosie O&#39;Donnell was on a non-stop thrill-a-minute rollercoaster ride. During Rosie&#39;s tenure on she got to witness first hand what a dishevelled drunk Danny DeVito is weirdly angry man Alec Baldwin is - plus it&#39;s where she first had contact with future husband-to-be O&#39;Donnell and Trump pretended to hate each other and then had a great big protracted quarrel to try and deflect attention from their blossoming romance. But what will define Rosie O&#39;Donnell&#39;s legacy on will be her last few days. Originally Rosie was all set to leave at the end of the current season - but then a ferocious, cringeworthy on-air split-screen catfight between Rosie O&#39;Donnell and Elisabeth Hasselbeck put an end to that plan. After ten minutes of hearing a fundamentalist creationist with a voice like a rape alarm howling about how brilliant war is, Rosie had enough and . And now we&#39;ll all get to read about all that stuff we already knew about in the forthcoming Rosie O&#39;Donnell memoirs, as Speaking at a breakfast gathering at BookExpo America, the publishing industry&#39;s annual national convention, O&#39;Donnell said her long-delayed memoir on fame will not be "vindictive" or "mean-spirited," but will offer a candid look at her very public life, including her brief, battling stint on "The View." Notice that careful wording there. Rosie O&#39;Donnell only said she wouldn&#39;t be vindictive, which sure leaves a lot of room for homogeneous bombastic obnoxiousness - which is handy, since that does seem to be Rosie&#39;s default setting these days. And don&#39;t think for a second that the Rosie O&#39;Donnell memoirs will go unchallenged. Elisabeth Hasselbeck is also planning a counter-memoir giving her take on Rosie&#39;s time at - and it&#39;ll be published just as soon as scientists discover a font that&#39;s objectionably shrill enough.

Since 1890, when Tchaikovsky and Marius Petipa, choreographer to the Tsar, bent the fairy tale to theatrical ends, it has stood in for the story of classical ballet itself. The good fairies of classicism are Reason, Harmony and Balance. These Enlightenment virtues protect ballet from the dangers of chaotic individualism. To revive the iconic work is to pick your way through a ghost-haunted forest in ballet history. The choreographer must decide which shades to listen to and which to ignore as he fashions a "Sleeping Beauty" for today. The task is daunting. American Ballet Theatre's artistic director Kevin McKenzie has wisely chosen to share his choreographic duties, bringing on onetime prima ballerina Gelsey Kirkland and theater director Michael Chernov. As you'd expect when three smart people are all in charge, this "Sleeping Beauty" is at once visionary and not quite finished, with technical details to clean up. Still it's wonderful and rare to be offered such a vision - stretching from one end of the three-hour ballet to the other and accumulating force through imaginative detail. ABT's "The Sleeping Beauty" tells its story clearly, wisely and with an infectious delight in old-fashioned stage machinery. It also celebrates the origins of ballet - less in the French court of King Louis XIV than in the fairyland of the unconscious. The fairies prevail in the prologue, set in the king's palace, and in the dream scene - the heart of this version - when Princess Aurora meets Prince Desir&#233; in her sleep and charges him with the vigor to fend off the evil fairy, Carabosse, and rescue her from eternal slumber. In the wedding scene, the couple emerges from the subterranean world of hope and fear to join a pantheon of fairy-tale characters, stepping straight from feeling into art and skipping the world altogether, as dance often does. It's nothing new to have "The Sleeping Beauty" move from the court to the realm of fairies and legend: Tchaikovsky's vivid and allusive music invites these shifts. But McKenzie and team have woven a web of meaning that promises to deepen the magic. For example, they have reinstated the melancholy violin solo, unceremoniously cut a week before the 1890 opening, to flesh out our prince's budding feelings; at the first chords of the next violin solo, when the Lilac Fairy presents Desir&#233; with a vision of Aurora, you tingle with d&#233;j ... vu. The prince's steps suffer from the usual problem of moody solos: without anyone to react to, you can only express vague yearning. Perhaps a visit by the prologue's fairies is in order. The prince might adapt their gloriously eccentric steps to his own heroic and romantic purposes. And when he falls asleep and is whisked through the air by four fairy knights (this is ABT, where the boys do everything!), the whirl of dream is not yet whirly enough. He looks like Superman. Also inspired and riddled with small glitches is the imagery tied to Carabosse's deadly spindle: the maypole dance that a gaggle of innocent teenagers creates from its blood-red threads before they're caught out and threatened with death; a weaving and hooking ensemble dance with flower garlands that's worthy of Busby Berkeley; and Carabosse's metamorphosis into a spider. On Friday, the maypole number ended in a tangle and the spider scene took too long to establish its intoxicating mood, but these are fixable problems. As for the dancing, a case of nerves plagued opening night. Once the elegant Veronika Part failed to get off the ground for Aurora's famous toe hops, she fell into a daze and let the music wash over her like a ship in a storm. Marcelo Gomes was a noble prince, but not as emotionally textured as he can be. Michelle Wiles seemed weighed down by the burden of being chief fairy. Only former ballerina Martine Van Hamel seemed to be having any fun. As an Elizabeth Taylor of an evil fairy, she was thoroughly self-possessed, taking her good time to ruin the party. By the wedding, everyone had relaxed. A plucky Xiomara Reyes as Princess Florine endeared, and Herman Cornejo dazzled as the bluebird. . Choreography by Kevin McKenzie, Gelsey Kirkland and Michael Chernov after Marius Petipa. Through June 9 at the Metropolitan Opera House.

Special to The Eagle When New York-based actor and director Wayne Bryan came to Wichita in 1986 as a guest artist for two shows with Music Theatre, he enjoyed himself but thought that was pretty much it. "I was brought in to direct 'Oklahoma!' and to be in 'Where's Charley?,' then went back to New York," Bryan recalled. "I thought that would be my Wichita experience because I was really very happy as a New Yorker. I was making a good living in theater and television and had been on Broadway." But Wichita wasn't quite done with Bryan. Music Theatre's then-producing director John Holly accepted a similar job in Houston and recommended that Bryan be considered as his successor. "I thought I might go for one summer to see what it was like. I began officially on April Fools' Day in 1988 and thought that would make a good story to tell my friends later," Bryan said with a laugh. But he's now beginning his 20th season as producing director of Music Theatre of Wichita and will have produced his 100th musical with the premiere of "Hairspray" in August. He's only the third person to lead Wichita's premier theatrical group, after founder Jim Miller and Holly. But he's the longest-running chief, heading up 20 of the group's 36 years and turning the theater from popular local summer entertainment into a nationally and internationally respected arts entity. Four years ago, his parents moved to Wichita from his original California hometown near Los Angeles to retire and be near him. "I guess I'm really here," he said. Bryan, who still has two windows of opportunity each year to guest-direct and guest-perform with other theater groups around the country, said he counts three milestones that have put Music Theatre in the big leagues. The first happened in 1993 when Bryan sought permission to rework the old college musical "Good News," which he had performed in on Broadway. "The authors were very reluctant to let us, but it had sat unproduced for years," he said. "We created a new libretto and new arrangements and made it into a really fun show. San Diego picked up our version, and it's now been done more than 250 times around the U.S., Canada and Great Britain. "Each time it's done, they have to give Music Theatre of Wichita credit in their programs. And the London cast went on to record a cast album, also giving us credit. We essentially revived a moribund show." The second milestone occurred in 2001, when Music Theatre presented the new musical "Honk!," a fanciful retelling of the fairy tale "The Ugly Duckling." It also recorded the first complete cast album, which has been shipped all over the world. "When you go to stores or Amazon.com, ours is the version you get," Bryan said. The third milestone came in 2004, when Bryan persuaded Disney to give Music Theatre a rare chance to stage its own "Beauty and the Beast," complete with new sets and costumes. Cautious Disney representatives who came to observe the show were so impressed that it opened doors for shots at other Disney shows, notably "Aida" in 2005 and the pre-Broadway tryout of "Disney's High School Musical," which opens the 2007 season next week. "Beauty and the Beast" also caused Music Theatre's costume and scenery shops to take a quantum leap in the minds of much older and larger theater groups, such as Philadelphia and Atlanta, who rented Wichita's trappings for their own productions. "Those sets and costumes have been on the road continuously for more than two years," Bryan said. "They've more than paid for themselves and now generate income for the theater. They've been back to be refurbished and are about to go out again. Our reputation has really grown beyond just being a theater that's a nice place to work in the summer." What keeps Bryan in Wichita is the artistic challenge and the community support he doesn't find in theaters elsewhere. "I find it fascinating that Wichita can support musical theater at the Broadway level while mounting its own shows," he said. "There's nothing like it in San Francisco or Chicago or Los Angeles these days. The touring shows have taken over their local productions." Music Theatre of Wichita can rise to the challenge because it's considered an educational troupe that uses a mix of Equity talent and college apprentices, both on stage and back stage. Bryan says the theater doesn't have to rely on bringing in celebrity names to sell a show. Instead, it's known as a training ground for young performers, who compete for the 25 or 26 slots in the repertory company and then occasionally are tapped to do larger roles. "They are at the age where they are so ready for the challenge," Bryan said. "Many times, when they have moved on to Broadway careers of their own, they come back as leads to pass on their experiences to the next generation." Michael Gruber, for example, took a two-week vacation from Broadway's "Miss Saigon" to perform "Singin' in the Rain" here. Gary Kilmer stepped out of his performance in Broadway's "Chicago" to direct Music Theatre's version in 2003. And last summer, Megan Osterhaus left Broadway's "Mamma Mia!" to cavort as "Thoroughly Modern Millie" here. She has since returned to Broadway in Disney's new "Mary Poppins."

Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore says the heiress has been " " since her arrival. Whitmore says Hilton has been booked and fingerprinted, and will be spending the rest of the night in a cell by herself. The spokesman added, "She'll be fine ... if she follows the rules."

I recently saw Nathan Lane and Tripp Cullman having an animated oral exchange in the back seat of a cab over Paris' incarceration. Perhaps a new musical is in the works -- an "American Evita"-style production starring a newly socially conscious Paris Hilton. Such a good opportunity for her to reinvent herself, she had pretty much mined every vein of her old self and no doubt realizes that the public needs something new from her. on Jun 4th 2007 by Andrea Jones 3. In the old days, Nathan Lane and Tripp Cullman would have been arrested for "buggery"... on Jun 4th 2007 by Clarris Manners 4. finally the spoiled little girl will receive a SMALL amount of punishment for drinking and driving. if this happened to a non celebrity we would be in prison, not even jail. and money doesn't buy what OJ? this is an outrage...she DESERVES so much MORE JAIL TIME! on Jun 4th 2007 by finally SOME justice 5. What a shame. Now we won't get any jail cell stories from her cellmates. on Jun 4th 2007 by 6. The public persona maybe all bravado bs for the camera, but from the looks of the SUV pics, she is as scared as is normal for any inmate. Good, then indications are she will need to follow rules. Thats a new one! on Jun 4th 2007 by Jason Steitler 7. Anybody else think the Spokesman looks like Al Bundy, Shoe Salesman? on Jun 4th 2007 by Jason Steitler 8. He look nervous and he should. One mistake - just for second - and if she gets hurt or hurt herself by accident, the city would have to pay up like never before. Some people are going to sleep much worse than Miss Hilton for the next 23 days. on Jun 4th 2007 by 9. Broom handles are about 4ft. long. No cell mate required. She'll get her abuse via long distance......I hope! on Jun 4th 2007 by Roger C 10. I think it is a shame that they are letting her stay in her own cell. She has to go to jail like everyone else would, she should have equal treatment all the way around - like any of us would. on Jun 4th 2007 by wendi s 11. Paris should NOT even be there! They are simply making a statement. People drive with suspended licenses all the time and never get serious jail time. This is all a shame that she has to go through ANY TIME AT ALL! Although with how crammed this jail is she will hopefully get out early due to over crowding if they decide to ever be fair to her. on Jun 4th 2007 by susan 12. She talks like she will be doing hard time, serving a long sentence. She will be hitting the club/drug/sex/boos scene before the end of the month. That's HOT ! on Jun 4th 2007 by Avrum Halevi 13. It is disgusting: She should not get any special treament at all. What a joke: that is not like going to a real prison at all. on Jun 4th 2007 by SO Fl 14. She is a spoiled brat! What a joke. Why doesn't she go do some good like Angelina Jolie? She should make better use of her so called fame and money by doing some good in the world. on Jun 4th 2007 by Pam 15. You know Paris is not even cute. She wastes all her time just partying. What job does she have? What good does she do on the world with all her money??? She certainly should not get any special treatment: that defeats the entire purpose of her jail sentence!

We just got a chance to check out the new shots of the live-action Transformers movie coming out next month that were shown on MTV last night. Until you've got a chance to check them out above we'll try not ruin it for you -- let's just say the footage is -- right, robogasmic. Yeah, so what if it's kind of like watching a long commercial for GM products -- how many chances do you get to see Optimus Prime battling the Constructicon-like Bonecrusher on a freeway, and toppling over the edge to fall in front of a Cadillac. Crap -- now it's a friggin' commercial again! Damn you, Michael Bay! Optimus Prime vs Bonecrusher Transformers Movie Update: New TV Hotness Shows Bumblebee Talking, Prime Transforming Transformers Movie Update: Michael Bay Releases Two Big Screen Trailers For The Small Screen Transformers Movie Update: Sector Seven Video Gives Nod To Dinobots, Insecticons, Lazerbeak And Generation One Bumblebee Transformers Movie Update: Final Theater Trailer Hits The Web...We Just Had A Robogasm ; all of our our country, our autobot Add this post to... wooooooooooot! I can't wait for this movie. That looks stupid and gay. I'm seeing alot of the same footage recycled in different trailers, but it looks like it might not suck. I guess we'll see soon enough, won't we? Don't say that. :( could they compress the video any more? I'm wringing my hands... If this sucks I'm kicking somebody's ass. You guys can say robogasmic all you want, but I'm more of a people person; and Megan Fox is hot. But, I still think they should have gone with the Go-Bots concept. Is anyone else noticing that the closer we get to the release date, the more and more these videos start looking like some weird ad for GM cars? Rest of post failed, continuing here- I mean, at the beginning it wasn't this way. And if my memory serves me correctly, GM saw no spike in sales for its massive investment into the Matrix sequels. How is this going to be any different? That weird looking dangly grey thing that cracks the bus in half near the beginning appears to be Megatron ... You'll find it on the bottom right here, listed as "Transformers Movie Leader: Megatron" ... He transforms into an ugly space ship. Ok, maybe it was a bit daft for Megatron to transform into a gun which couldn't fire without another transformer holding him and pulling the trigger, but they could have at least turned him into some type of cannon like Galvatron. Anyway, I really hope Mr. Bay doesn't disappoint. : The matrix wasn't a car-centric movie. : I just started getting that feeling while watching this preview. I'm half expecting Megatron to sport a VIN number that starts with "J." That said, the bots falling off the overpass totally rocked. Yeah, but the original was a half-hour toy commercial anyhows, so this isn't too unexpected. Optimus vs Bonecrusher (that wasn't Megatron) was pure awesome!!!

Don't read this unless you have seen that episode (and the last few episodes from the current season). Thatâs all I could think during the white-knuckled final minutes of Sundayâs episode of â For a long time, Iâve thought it would make sense for Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini) to die as the series closed (and thatâs just a guess, I have no inside information). But I never really pondered the thought that there could be a lot of carnage around Tony as the end approached, as the rough beast known as the âSopranosâ finale slouches towards Bethlehem to be born. Are you, like me, wondering if this episode might be better than next weekâs series finale? Ever notice that many programs (and so many prior seasons of âThe Sopranosâ) have a second-to-last episode that is much better than the actual finale? I wonder if thatâll be the case here. Regardless, Sundayâs second-to-last episode was certainly a classic. As long as you ignore most of the A.J. (Robert Iler) stuff (yeah, yeah, the sins of the father are visited on the son. I get it. Enough already.) But back to Silvio Dante. The dapper, understated linchpin of Tonyâs crew. Always the one with the perfectly timed shrug. The brow wrinkled just enough for Tony to sigh, âWhatâs wrong?â Silvio wasnât (isnât?) a shouter or a tough guy or a bundle of rage (in other words, heâs not Paulie Walnuts). He was just everything Tony needed in a confidante. Wise, trustworthy, loyal and dependable. And, as played by the talented Steven Van Zandt, dryly witty when circumstances allowed. I donât want Sil to be dead. As Sundayâs episode closed, all we knew was that doctors didnât think heâd regain consciousness. I canât quite picture him not in the picture, and his near-death is bringing it home to me, finally â âThe Sopranosâ is ending. For real. What? Who allowed this to happen? OK, truth be told, I have long thought that the sixth season (which includes the most recent batch of episodes and the group of episodes before that) has had too many sluggish, stumbling moments, but hey, itâs still âThe Sopranos.â I canât watch. Not possible. And the last few episodes have been really good. Since the shocking death of Christopher Moltisanti (Michael Imperioli), a lot of momentum has built up in Tonyâs world. A world in which all due respect must be paid, but also a world in which no sins are ever forgotten. The Russian in the forest from so many episodes ago? Heâs forgotten. But all of Tonyâs sins have come home to roost now. Hence Tony finishing out last nightâs episode sleeping with his gun, just as John Wayne might have in some heroic western. On the chalkboard in A.Jâs classroom in a recent episode, a quote from Wordsworth: âGetting and spending, we lay waste to our powers.â Somehow that doesnât strike he as a harbinger of good things to come for anyone in the âSopranosâ family. Bobby Bacala (Steven Schirripa) died last night as well, and though Bobby didnât have the stature of a Silvio, his death scene was exceptionally well directed by Alan Taylor. The way in which the toy trainâs journey was intercut with Bobbyâs impending demise could have been cheesy or comical â it was a toy train, after all â but thanks to the sharp, vivid direction and editing, the scene was almost impossibly tense. Train sequences have been used to heighten drama since the time of the Lumiere brothers, and, as happens so often on âThe Sopranos,â perhaps the use of the train in the scene was an homage to classic cinema. Still, the scene didnât come off as a static example of film theory in action. The setting of the hit -- in a train shop, next to a perfectly manicured model-train village, as Bobby decided to splurge on a beloved vintage train â all those things made his death especially poignant. Though he was obviously capable of violence, there was a childlike innocence about the lumbering Bobby. To see him die among the trains he loved so much made his death all the more sad. Still, I wonât miss Bobby like Iâll miss Sil. And Iâll certainly miss the absorbing give and take between Tony and his psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), which, as of Sundayâs episode, also appears to be over. How many silent reaction shots has Bracco filmed over the last eight years? It has to be more than a hundred. But she never made them less than fascinating. But thatâs nothing compared to scenes in which her character sparred with Gandolfiniâs â thatâs some serious, world-class acting there. Some other things Iâll miss about The way Paulie Walnuts says, âEow!,â the all-purpose interjection on âThe Sopranos,â which can be used in any number of sentences: âEow! There he is!â to âEow! Did you just disrespect the Bing?â The showâs opening credit sequence, one of the all-time greats. James Gandolfini as Tony and Edie Falco as Carmela. Honestly, have two actors playing a married couple ever done more absorbing work or been more perfectly cast? Thereâs a lot more that Iâll miss (and I recommend Newark Star-Ledger critic on the episode as well), but I wanted to give you a chance to weigh in. Though Tony advised us recently that, ââRemember whenâ is the lowest form of conversation,â letâs disregard that for the moment. Tell us what aspect of âThe Sopranos,â which signs off for good June 10, youâll miss the most. Photos: Steven Van Zandt as Silvio Dante, James Gandolfini and Edie Falco as Tony and Carmela Soprano. I will miss the Soprano family. Tony is a flat-out gansta and he's done some dispicable things, but I always rooted for him and his family. I will especially miss Carmella, who is the glue of that family, and who'll ultimately stand by her man no matter what he does. Oh, and I will also miss the awesome opening credits, and the excitement I feel when I hear that song and know that the show is about to begin. P.S. Will Carmella ever find out what happened to Adrianna? | Jun 4, 2007 8:57:33 AM Like Tony wisely said, "Everything turns to [deleted]." | Jun 4, 2007 9:19:20 AM All great points, but I just wanted to point out that James Gandolfini's last name is misspelled a couple times in your column. | Jun 4, 2007 9:21:57 AM Watching the Sopranos final episodes is like reading a great novel. The closer you get to the end, the slower you read. I am sad The Soprano's is ending, but "whatcha gonna do?" | Jun 4, 2007 9:23:17 AM I will most miss Gandolfini's trancendant acting. Seriously, there is no finer actor working today. While I'm sure we'll be seeing him again, it won't be as Tony Soprano - and I would be hard pressed to name another melding of an actor to his role that is as perfect. I have also been missing Chrissy! Self-absorbed little jerk that he was, he just may have been my favorite character. At the very least, second-favorite. His battles with Paulie Walnuts will be fondly remembered. | Jun 4, 2007 9:28:00 AM Since the Godfather came out in 1972 Hollywood has longed to create a world in which a murderous, selfish, psychotic criminal can be a sympathetic character. The Godfather purposely left the "real" world out of the movie. They never showed innocents being killed or even strong-armed. Sure in Godfather two the poor grocery store owner was extorted from, but that was before Vito took over. And even when Vito did take control all they showed him doing was scaring a landlord into lowering a woman's rent. The rest of the movie was filmed within the mob world, where everyone who died had "Chosen this life". The Sopranos changed that a bit. There is still a mob honor that may or may not actually exist amongst killers in the real world, but they did delve into the death of bystanders, the extortion of innocents, and the sometimes random rage of these mob fellas. On the flip side, however, each guy was a family man with children and a wife. Each worried about taxes and bills and domestic issues. Why do we love Tony Soprano? Because he is what we sometimes wish we could be, but for the most part our morals and ethics would never allows us to be. He is a less civilized man who acts on instinct, fights for survival, and denies himself no pleasures along the way. How many men have never thought about sleeping with hundreds of women whenever they want, but still having their loving wives at home? How many men have never dreamed about knocking out the teeth of someone who insults their child? How many men have never thought about living in a mansion and working only when they feel like it? Not too many I suspect. I'll tell you what I will miss the most about the Sopranos: I will miss the look at a life that I could never have, a life that I do not really want, but one that I might enjoy for a short while...That is-- until the bullets start flying. | Jun 4, 2007 9:40:18 AM RIP, via con dio | Jun 4, 2007 9:41:40 AM I agree, Mo, but the Melfi stuff rang false to me. After she resisted Bogdanovich's bs research rap, to have dealt with Tony like that didn't make sense. Also, his words and actions... especially putting the article back in the magazine before he walked out.... belied the basics of the study. If that was the final scene, it REALLY sucked. I still can't buy Phil Leotardo as the angel of death, but we'll see... (And there's no way he lives in Flatbush... where I grew up. Shore Road, maybe...) Posted by: Rockin' Rich | Jun 4, 2007 9:43:07 AM Great article. I have to point out that there were several articles in the New Jersey papers last winter about permitting problems for the last scene of the show, to be filmed in a Bloomfield ice cream parlor. The articles reported that the problems were resolved and the scene was shot, with the characters in the scene being Tony, Carmela, & Silvio. So reports of Silvio's death may be greatly exaggerated. (Thanks Mark Twain) | Jun 4, 2007 9:44:04 AM Edie Falco, Wow! She has, more than any of the characters, been believable. A couple of seasons back when she threw Tony out for cheating. She nailed that scene to the freakin' wall. I had a similar real life scene with an ex like that and I don't think I could have been more uncomfortable seeing it portrayed. She is one of the best I have seen. | Jun 4, 2007 9:45:13 AM I think Sil will pull through. He has to...he's SIL! The last two episodes of "The Sopranos" were excellent, which is good news because I've been pretty disappointed with most of Season 6. It will be very interesting to see what happens next week. I agree that I don't think the final episode will be quite as bloody as yesterday's. My guess is that the Jersey boys will take out Phil, and that will pretty much be the end of it. Hopefully Sil will recover. (If he doesn't, though, how unbelievably ironic is it that the one guy Tony's left with in the end is Paulie?! Hilarious!) I also want to comment on Dr. Melfi's actions in last night's episode: despicable! Her character has always annoyed me, but I never truly hated her until last night. What a selfish and unprofessional thing to do. I hope she somehow ends up getting whacked next Sunday, just for the hell of it. | Jun 4, 2007 9:46:01 AM Like all, I'll miss Tony...unwaivering and unforgiving, forever loyal, flawed but perfectly, "fat [removed] crook from Jersey." And RIP to Sil...you cannot buy that type of loyalty -- truly a rare breed. And to Pauly...one a kind, straight gangster. And if there's one thing I can say about the three...at least they're going out like real gangsters, and not like the Rat [removed] of today. | Jun 4, 2007 9:54:05 AM I can't wait for the movie! ;) Posted by: Dan | Jun 4, 2007 9:58:49 AM I will miss the show tremendously. Yes, there have been seasons that you were wondering who the heck was writing the show (dream episodes - yuck!). But man-o-man this show was almost as good as the first Godfather. Tony Soprano is a man's man - no doubt! Not that I want my 9 year old son to grow up like him, but if he could have his toughness without the crime - that would be awesome. I will be quoting many phrases from this show for a long, long time. I really do hope there will be a movie. Or at the very least a take-off, like a Scarface HBO mini-series. I am so looking forward to this Sunday's final episode - no matter what happens, it will be bitter sweet. | Jun 4, 2007 10:04:02 AM It's absolutely impossible to mention all of the things I'm going to miss. I think what my wife and I comment a lot on as soon as the show ends is just the ingenious way an episode ends. Either the great way Tony is just sitting there staring into space accompanied by great music, or by the twists and turns the plot takes with somone dying. Words can't describe how sad I am the series is coming to an end. It was the best way to cap off a weekend. | Jun 4, 2007 10:04:50 AM Over the last several episodes in which the family memebers are dropping like fies, it occurs to me that no new members have been made since Bobby. The backroom of the Bing is empty now in comparison of a year ago. If the death of Tony is imminent, so is the total collapse of the family. Nothing will remain but a vacuum. A sad way to eliminate any chance of a spinoff. | Jun 4, 2007 10:06:47 AM I don't believe Tony will get wacked at all. Only because Sil did not die. Keep in mind the show is called Sopranos in this case and also for any future movies Tony will reign. The show is an outstanding show and I'm really going to miss it. I love Big Love however after the final episode of Sopranos I am getting rid of HBO. Sopranos, and Sex in The City and Wire are the only reason why I kept HBO. Two or the Three are gone.............. | Jun 4, 2007 10:14:33 AM The Sopranos has been television at it's very best. You can't help but love Tony even when you know what he is. Last night was so amazing, I could barely sleep thinking about it. I share the same sentiments...NOT SIL!!! OH, God, NOT SIL!! But I was relieved that Chris finally got it. I always thrill at the opening credits but especially so since when my husband and I took a trip to NY 6 years ago, we rented a car in Newark and he took me on the same highway and streets that Tony drives on in the opening. And we had the soundtrack cd playing in the background! It was magic! I don't want Tony to die...I would hate for Phil to win...I hate Phil just like I can't stand Dr. Melfi. What a simpering, self-righteous coward she turned out to be and her snotty disgusting dinner guests as well. Tony is truly alone. Can he stand up and defend himself and his family? I sure hope so. He's a truly great and amazing character and tv will be a lot dimmer with his loss. Gandolfini is AMAZING. I cannot find the words to describe what he has done these 7 years with his characterization of Tony. There aren't enough awards to give him. He deserves them ALL. I'm almost holding my breath till next week even though I am so sad to see them go. These people, so flawed, yet so vulnerable made us love them even when we knew they were terrible people. That's special. | Jun 4, 2007 10:25:59 AM Great Recap of last night's episode. I read a theory on hbo msg board from someone. Tony is falling asleep as this episode ends. It is likely, the first 10 minutes of the finale may be a dream sequence we are tricked to believe is real. I felt empty with the Melfi stuff. I'm also upset about Silv. Posted by: urban twang | Jun 4, 2007 10:39:44 AM I have to disagree with the comments of some that most of this season has been disappointing. I think it has been one of the best overall. Of course there have been some episodes not as good as others, (a little less whining from AJ) but that is relative when it comes to this show. Started off with a bang when Tony and Bobby get into that fight, and then Bobby backs into the trees... not only intense but hilarious at the same time.....Sopranos can be so over the top sometimes that you have to laugh....especially if Paulie is involved. I also loved the episode when Tony and Paulie take the road trip to Miami... Tony just can't take Paulie never shutting up... and Junior hooking up with that kid and then stomping the old professor from Rutgers.... I will intensely miss this show and my only regret is that it's over. The acting, writing, and directing have been superb for years.... | Jun 4, 2007 10:59:38 AM This is definitely the end, folks. One more hour -- no movie, no miniseries, no spinoffs. And that's fine with me; I think the show would have ideally lasted only fives seasons, we could have dropped some of the annoying subplots like the Tony B. and Vito stuff. I think what Carlos said is interesting, and typical of many of us male viewers: We love Tony Soprano. I would never, ever want to be friends with someone like Tony, but at the same time I can't help but like him and root for him. There are a few thing about him that remind of my father (same tastes in music and food, for example), but then again that feels like a real insult to my father. Sort of the same way Dr. Kupferberg calls Tony a monster but loves getting the dirt on him from Melfi. There's something strangely appealing about a "man's man" who takes what he wants --- money, women, power, etc. And yet that the same man can be devastated by a family of ducks briefly visiting his swimming pool. That's what I'll miss about The Sopranos. Posted by: MaxPower | Jun 4, 2007 11:03:57 AM They called it " this thing of ours." And it was/is a strong bond of love, friendship, family ties and mutual respect. Not that any of that makes sociopathic behaviour acceptable or desirable but, hey, it's a TV show and fictional. What I particularly enjoyed was the group dynamic of the men... it was like being at my Nonna's for Sunday dinner after Mass and all my uncles were there. Same goofy jokes, same malaprops, same gestures and snappy clothes, same testosterone-soaked repartee. I will miss this finely-wrought drama with its comic overtones, and this broad comedy with a darker, seamier underside. It's certainly set the standard for what constitutes excellence in TV programming fromhere on out. | Jun 4, 2007 11:05:51 AM The thing I'll miss the most is how each season except for this one has begun, with Tony waddling down the driveway in his robe to get the morning paper. In so many episodes, it has cracked me up how something as simple as that has led to so much. Earlier this season after a confrontation with the feds, Tony said to Carmela, "It's too dangerous for me to get the paper." It seems that it would be a fitting ending next week if that was the final scene...an uneventful walk down the driveway. Tony picks up the paper, opens it, and for the first time he looks up and nothing is there. Then he simply walks back up the driveway after tucking it under his arm. He would be saying goodbye to us in the same way that he introduced himself. | Jun 4, 2007 11:07:01 AM Personally, I was very disapointed in the episode. It felt too much like, "Oh we only have two episdoes left, we need to start wrapping up characters." Dr. Melfi's would have never acted (dumping Tony)that way. Remember, the character had too much principle to even seek help from Tony after she was raped! And while Bobby's death was great editing, how could writers justify Phil thinking Bobby was important enough to whack, especially over someone like Paulie? It would have been more realistic for Tony to have whacked Bobby given their fight at the lake and Bobby's ongoing concern over Uncle Junior. Lastly, in a previous season, Phil was adament that you never whack another boss. Now suddenly, it's ok. I don't think they ever properly demonstrated why Phil's new found positions. Other than the way Imperioli's character bit the dust, this whole last set of espisodes have been an unrealistic rush to wrap up the season. Johnny S. aflicted with cancer and dying in the same episode...give me a break! Would Silvio really had not had a gun in hand after they knew Phil was coming for them? | Jun 4, 2007 11:11:55 AM Phil's guys whack someone in Tony's immediate family (AJ? Meadow?) and Big-T goes berserk, calls his FBI buddy (we've been seeing a lot of him in the last few episodes, eh?), and rats out Phil... if... they will put the NY mobster in jail for the rest of his life... which as we know from last week's sit-down scene... is worse than death to Phil, having already spent 20 years in the can. Tony & family then go into the FBI witness protection program and end up in south FL where he becomes an FBI trainer. | Jun 4, 2007 11:17:41 AM Acting for this show has ALWAYS been incredible! The writing has had it's ups and downs but the actors have ALWAYS shined! Gandolfini is awesome!!!...and the rest of the cast incredible as well. Very well put-together series that will be hard to match for years to come...BIG shoes to fill!! I know I'll miss this GREAT show! | Jun 4, 2007 11:22:28 AM David Chase has said that, from the beginning, he knew how the series would end. That's tantalizing. Tony dies? Phil dies? They work out a deal? I'd say it's 55-45 that Tony dies, just because Chase doesn't want any future spinoffs. I happen to like the slow, smoldering episodes that led off this final half-season, and I also liked the Tony dream scenes from the past very much. I think, though, that Tony's sudden and brief gambling problem, and his thoughts about killing Paulie on the boat, and the buildup of rancor leading to Tony killing Chris were less than convincing. It seemed that Chase originally planned more episodes to fill in those blanks, but he had to telescope them into the airtime HBO would allow. I thought Tony's shrink was going to report him to the cops, because he would intimate he was going to commit a future crime---but it doesn't look, now, like that this is going to happen. It would have made a good final indignity. It's possible we'll see Tony dead in his pool, where the series began---and his beloved ducks will return to his floating corpse. | Jun 4, 2007 11:26:35 AM I have never been moved by a movie or show since Bambi's mother died. It was bound to happen, but I thought that they would have taken Phil out and all would have ended. More than that I thought that someone from Jersey was going to blowup the hair salon when the New York crew was plotting their plan. Despite my hopes it seems that things happened in the order that the characters set for themselves. Bobby should not have been at a friggin toy store and Sil should have had his gun with him. As you recall, Tony told him to put the word out. This should have meant packing you gun and shoot when you see them coming. I know that he was out the door but do you put your gun in a briefcase. I fear now that Paulie is going to take Tony out. If not, the younger guys in the crew will take out Paulie and Tony and that will be the story. I don't see how closing yourself up in a house is a solution. It seems more like the end from within. I'm sorry to say it but the same way Bobby went into a toy store these guys are in a neighborhood with their cars parked outside. Finally, the image of Tony in a bed with the biggest gun that will not help him in a small room reduces him to being a punk in the end. So I guess the end is near.....they had a long run and Tony end may call for him to be killed by someone close to him since he killed 2 of his own cousins. | Jun 4, 2007 11:28:23 AM Re: the "breakup" between Dr. Melfi and Tony. When Tony is walking out of her office, calls her behavior "immoral" and very delicately and sarcastically replaces the recipe in the magazine, I couldn't help but think about how far he had come since the first season. "early" Tony would have kicked over the coffee table again, raged profanely at Dr. Melfi, and ripped the magazine in half on his way out. Tony has grown. Dr. Melfi seems to be acting more childishly than he, at this point. I think she's right, she can't help him any longer. But not for the reasons she thinks. | Jun 4, 2007 11:29:37 AM RIP Bobby Bacala and come back to us Sil! Great episode, why does it have to end. Great, great stuff almost as good as, "leave the gun, get the canollis". Fougeddaboutit! | Jun 4, 2007 11:35:13 AM HBO's not going to kill a cash cow like this. Tony is imagining all of this. He's actually still back in Vegas with the stripper tripping on the Peyote... Posted by: Shawn | Jun 4, 2007 11:40:11 AM I hate to say it, but its seems the writers have left no way out but to kill Tony (or put him in the witness protection progam, which I don't believe his character would ever do). They have been setting up Tony's demise throughout season 6 by highlighting his weaknesses as never before (Tony losing a fight to Bobby? And gambling debts.. Tony Soprano can't pay his football bookie???), his paranoid lack of loyalty to anyone but himself (kills Christopher, then screws his Vegas girl), and his never ending paranoia (how close to killing Paulie did he come?). Even if the show continued, they have left viewers with none of the core "grit" characters, but for Tony's immediate family (and I don't think I can listen to AJ cry again). Assuming Sil doesn't make it, a meeting at the Bing would now include... Tony and Paulie, his worst guy? Sadly, noboy's left from the Jersey crew, and the writers have left little room for mauever. A sad end to a great series. Posted by: Bri | Jun 4, 2007 11:41:00 AM I think Sil is still alive. Tony said that the doctors wouldn't give him an update which Paulie followed with that he heard through someone else that Sil would not regain conscienousness. I think this is Sil's way out of a down spiral he has been witnessing for a while. The director gave strong images as to where Sil was shot. In the side, in the arm, none looked lethal. I think all of Tony's paranoia about his family is true and possibly Paulie and Sil are working both sides of the fence. How could Paulie give such bad information to the hitmen?!? It doesn't seem right. How do you screw-up hitting a boss?! | Jun 4, 2007 11:42:03 AM I so enjoyed last night's episode. After a poor start to this last season (who wrote those episodes?) the show is back on track and sharp as a butcher's knife! Next week will be sad no matter how it ends - only because its the end. I keep hoping Tony and his family will be spared with the possibility of a movie later on? (one can only hope). I also did not like the Dr. Melfi section last night. I think it would be a pretty bad psychiatrist who would toss out a patient for no good reason. I'm sure her actions and attitude would have been shameful in the real world. Complaining about a page torn from a magazine???? Give me a break! Anyway, I'm sad to see it end. Series like this are soooo rare. Parting shot...if Phil doesn't get offed next week I'm going to be stompin mad!! Incidentally, one more thing I'll miss above all else....I grew up in Kearny, NJ just 1 1/2 blocks from Satrielle's. Now I'm 3,000 miles away. I'll miss the glimpses of my old territory. | Jun 4, 2007 11:50:36 AM The whole feel of last night's episode is still chilling. Absolutely the best film-making throughout, but Tony's last scene with the gun in the bedroom at the safe house and the shot of the muted light on the closed door - brilliant!!! They could have ended the whole thing right there. Next week has a lot to live up to. | Jun 4, 2007 11:54:50 AM I hope Sil pulls through. He is one of kind. The person that wrote he was a "Dapper", was right. I love the scene right before the decision was made to go to war, when he was using the shoe shiner. His character is very New Jersey. Reminds me of my father, god rest his soul. I think the things he did for the mob he only did out of loyalty, I never really pictured him as a gangster, but more of a business man. It's amazing how attached you become to certain characters. It was sad when I heard he might not regain consciousness. I will defintely watch the final episode. | Jun 4, 2007 11:56:45 AM I will miss Tony and the gang too. I think it's going to end with Agent Harris tipping off Tony about Phil's next move. Harris realizes he's consumed with the lives of Tony Soprano and crew and he's willing to lose his job over it. After all, if Tony dies... Harris' career dies too. It's art imitating life. Harris' loyalty to Tony...mirrors the fan obsession (maybe too strong a word)... with the show. I think Tony will live and life will return to Soprano "normal". I'd like to see the last scene with Tony enjoying a cigar in the backyard... as ducks appear. | Jun 4, 2007 12:07:34 PM I'll miss the music! The theme song, of course, but the carefully selected music that embraces each episode as well I'll miss Tony, his family and all the cast of characters that fall in-between from the FBI agents to Carmela's parents. This series has been expertly cast. I hope Tony survives, but I doubt that he will. For some reason I don't think it will be Phil that takes him out. An excellent series, well written, acted and cast. It will be truly missed. | Jun 4, 2007 12:07:48 PM The music is amazing too. At the end of last weeks episode, there was a lullaby my grandmother used to sing (Ninni Ninna) 60 years ago. If you grew up Sicilian American, the whole show has been a reminder of family, though mine was not quite so violent. | Jun 4, 2007 12:09:45 PM I too cannot believe that Dr. Melfi would decide that Tony is unhelpable based on the reading of a single article; or that she would suddenly doubt his sincerity after 7 years. In past seasons, Dr. Melfi's involvement with Tony has forced her into hiding, driven her to alcoholism, and strained her relationship with her ex-husband and son. He also slept with her suicidal patient, stalked her following his split with Carmela, and has physically threatened her and verbally assaulted her on numerous occasions. But it is a torn-out recipe that supposedly motivates her to end their relationship in the cruelest and most unprofessional way imaginable? Come on. Fortunately, the incomparable Lorraine Bracco is so wonderful that she made this unjustifiable scene actually work. Please, HBO staff writers---give us material that's worthy of the characters you've created, and the actors who play them! | Jun 4, 2007 12:12:19 PM When all is said and done it is a TV show - get outside and play with the kids! | Jun 4, 2007 12:20:24 PM the sopranos - where do you start, and where do you end? the sopranos is the most engaging show on television period; this voyeuristic aperture into mafia life is beyond words, because it is not simply mob life...it is life. the many sides to a person, to a life, even to a criminal and their pursuit of life. the sopranos and its actors are the most believable cast in a televised drama to come along in several decades. i don't root for tony, as some have said. i don't cheer for the bad guy, because i don't see Tony as the bad guy. i see him as the regular guy who has made bad choices. i see tony as a man who fights for what is right and in accordance with his code of ethics -- yes, he does have a moral ethos. i appreciate any man who will stand by his choices for better or worse. that is tony soprano. he is caniving, manipulative, deranged, and he is every man. i broke a few guys' teeth so i know. it is a struggle to walk straight in a world that is crooked. the show has is the best representation of life: it has its dull moments that drag on, its family moments, its thrilling moments. and that is life. sometimes it's slow and sometimes it's thrilling. so some people say certain parts are boring...well, life is that way. bottom line, sopranos is legendary...and i pray that tony does not die...i mean, come on, he just got shot by junior so that would be hella corny. to recover from getting shot only to die from bullets this season. D.K.T. D.K.T. D.K.T. D.K.T.! D.K.T. = don't kill tony | Jun 4, 2007 12:20:35 PM Phil's goomar, the chick that got blown away, is from Chicago! | Jun 4, 2007 12:25:15 PM sil, come on, what gangster doesn't carry his heat when the war is on... also, when they got to the safe house i think i saw a life-size cut-out of sil in the corner, this means he going to be the new boss. | Jun 4, 2007 12:43:26 PM There are some who will disagree with me, but what I'll miss most of all are the dream sequence episodes. The episode last night ended with Tony falling asleep with his rifle, so we may get to see one for the last time next week! Posted by: Nancy | Jun 4, 2007 12:45:28 PM Patsy Parisi ran off but I don't think he got shot. Does anyone think he'll come back and do anything important in the final episode? Some of the stuff in this last season seemed pretty extraneous and kept us from getting to the meat of the story: I never really liked Dr. Melfi, but that last scene with her just didn't make sense. I kept thinking "did I miss something?" What was with all the gambling issues -- where did that go? And AJ's whining and crying... I think if I was Tony, I would've slapped AJ and made him go rake the leaves or something. I'd for sure would've taken away his computer & internet. | Jun 4, 2007 12:46:40 PM I HAVE TO SAY THE HARDEST THING WAS TO WATCH SYLVIO GET WHACKED LIKE THAT EVEN THOUGH HES NOT 100 PERCENT DEAD. FROM WATCHING THE SHOW FOR SO LONG YOU ALMOST HAVE A BOND WITH THE CHARACHTERS I GUESS IF IT WAS MADE FROM THE NEW YORK SIDE IT WOULD BE THE OTHER WAY AROUND. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE TONY COME OUT OF IT AND MAYBE HAND MOST OF THE EVERY DAY BUSINESS OVER TO PAULIE.I HOPE IT DOESNT END WITH PAULIE BETRAYING TONY BC THAT WOULD JUST BE A LAME WAY FOR HIME TO BE KILLED BY ONE OF THR LAST PEOPLE HE HAD BY HIS SIDE. I WOULD NICE TO SEE PHIL END UP WITH A SURPRISE ATTACK AND KILL HIM AND MOST OF HIS CREW OFF. | Jun 4, 2007 12:55:36 PM Great Episode. When Tony requested "help" from overseas, I thought for a split moment that Furio might re-enter the picture. But I suppose with just one episode left, you couldn't do that scenario justice. I would be very happy if Carmella left Tony, but I don't think that'll happen. | Jun 4, 2007 12:59:41 PM VERY EDGY.....that is the best way to describe last night's episode. As others have lamented....I feel bad about Bobby....but Sil needs to pull through. I think Paulie is working for Phil and has assisted in orchestrating the hits. His resentment over the years have piled up.... He was ready to switch families for Johnny Sac and bad mouthed him in front of others just as he's been doing about Phil. I feel that Tony will come through all of this and his enemies will be taken care of and when all is said and done...Tony will somehow get out of the business. On a lighter note....I got the privilege to meet James Gandolfin when he was here in New Orleans for Mardi Gras....what a GREAT guy. | Jun 4, 2007 1:00:29 PM One possible ending. Tony gets wacked, Carmella goes to Italy to recover and meets Furio. | Jun 4, 2007 1:02:12 PM Who says a spinoff, mini-series or movie has to happen chronologically? I'd love to see a movie or mini-series about how Tony made his bones 5, 10 or 20 years earlier than the time-setting of Sopranos. Maybe even with Gandolfini reminicing back with someone playing a younger T when needed (think Goodfellas Hendry Hill). Dr. Melfi acted exactly as anyone acts when the truth dawns on them. It was more realistic than anything. It had nothing to do with the receipe, that was just an excuse to start the ending. Haven't you ever acted a way when you found out the truth about something and regretted how you handled it? There's not enough episodes left for Melfi to explain her quick reaction to Tony possibly playing her and delve into "the study". They killed Bobby and not Paulie because Paulie's not management. Phil wanted management only which is T (boss), Sil (consig) and Backala (underboss/3rd). Even the laser-selling thug in NY mentions this. I was a little ticked about Sil not having a gun on his body. That's not realistic especially after a bungled hit. Tony SLEPT with his howitzer for chrissake. What I can't wait for, what I'm really excited about is how Paulie fits into the finale. He's such a loose cannon that if he's been chosen to die, I'm sure he goes out with a blaze of glory - "During the Columbo war of the 70s, I made it alive through the skin of my balls." Classic. | Jun 4, 2007 1:18:30 PM Cmon... It's Paulie. Not mentioning his name in the kill the head speech. Dealing with the new establishment when it's done? What went wrong with Phil's supposed whack? Who was to blame with a wrong address of Phil's mistress? | Jun 4, 2007 1:25:37 PM I'm left wondering if next week the terrorist angle comes into play. They(middle eastern guys) have been mentioned a couple of times this season, and the FBI agent seems to keep popping up. Nuclear or chemical attack on the NY/NJ area next week? Scott in South Loop | Jun 4, 2007 1:28:23 PM As the story of the Soprano family tensely draws to a close I think the thing I will miss the most is the incredible dichotomy of Tony's character. He's like another Cybil trying desperately to run interferance between the diametrically opposed facets of his split-personality. The most memorable episode, for me, will always be the one in which his friend insisted on playing poker and when he lost Tony had no choice but to milk his sporting-goods business down to nothing in order to pay the debt. As a friend Tony tried to warn him; tried to stop him; but in the end even the people he is closest to are not immune from the heavy-handed tactics necessary to be a mobster and stay in the game. Business, after all, is just business. I'll miss Tony, Carmella, the kids - all of them. But I'll miss the struggle, more. | Jun 4, 2007 1:34:28 PM I wondered last night as Tony was on the bed with the assault weapon looking at the door if he would do himself in. His world has been crumbling around him for some time. Maybe the depression within himself will prove to be a more formidable enemy than the men (and Janice) around him. | Jun 4, 2007 1:36:30 PM I thought last night's episode was exciting but it cut from one situation to another with little explanation between. This is not the usual pace of a Sopranos episode. They usually write a scene with such finesse and move logically from scene to scene. I feel like they are rushing to the end out of some sort of desparation to 'just get to the end'. It's almost as if they added an extra season or two just to sell more HBO. By the way, where was A.J. at the end? Was he in the living room with the rest of the family? | Jun 4, 2007 1:37:16 PM I thought it was a great show, too. The Sopranos wrap up has been excellent so far, if not perfect. I agree that it realy made no sense at all for Sill to be pulling out of the Ba Da Bing not full strapped and ready to do battle, so that seemed contrived. I just can't see two guys pulling up to essentially Tony S's headquarters, taking out a top guy, and getting out of there alive. Wouldn't someone from the club, even a lower down type guy, come running out with a shotgun and blown the enemy jokers away. Wouldn't Sil have been much more careful? | Jun 4, 2007 1:51:10 PM I LOVE this show but I do hope they all die. (To answer previous poster) ... They are great characters but they are all BAD people. I thought playing The Doors' "The End" was brilliant. And the "Exile on Main Street" comment while emptying the pool was also great symbolisms of the end coming so near ... There will be many Soprano orphans out there... | Jun 4, 2007 1:56:38 PM So many great moments in this show that it's impossible to list them all. But here's a few that stand out in my mind: a. Paulie and Christopher chasing the guy in the Pine Meadows in the snow. Has there ever been a series of scenes as funny and as grisly as these in a TV drama? b. The episode where they kill Pussy. And then the contradiction between Tony's reaction and Paulie's reaction to that "singing fish" toy. c. Carmella's realization that the priest was hooked on lonely wives. d. Tony getting the big SUV for payment and then keeping the SUV for his own family (and Meadow's reaction). e. Tony's cousin Tony -- all of the episodes with Steve Buscemi and, especially, the last scene. f. The first murder Tony commits on the series -- the guy in Maine. g. Christopher's reaction to Adrianna when she tells him the truth about the feds. (And Adrianna barfing all over the feds.) Posted by: anonymous | Jun 4, 2007 1:57:19 PM To: Rockin' Rich: The house that Phil lived in (the one with the field stone turrets) is on the corner of Dorchester and Marborough Roads - that's in the Midwood section of Brooklyn. | Jun 4, 2007 2:03:49 PM All I can say about losing our seasonal 9PM Sundays, is a combination of all other comments posted! I have always been impressed with Edie Falco's performance since the first season. I don't even have to mention Gandolfini's performance. It will be legendary!! My guess for the last episode??? I think Paulie is batting for the other team!! There is absolutely no reason Paulie shouldn't have been named as the top three. Phil got to him! If my guess is correct, I hope Tony figures it out in the last episode and takes care of Paulie himself! | Jun 4, 2007 2:14:00 PM I think he'll be alive in the end, but he'll be alone. Who does he have left on his crew? Paulie and Patsy? Those closest to Tony, those he came to depend on most, have all left him. It's a prison of his own making in a lot of ways. I'll most miss watching Gandolfini and Falco square off against each other. I still get chills just thinking of the scene in the boathouse during White Caps, when she's throwing him out, yelling "You were my guy!" | Jun 4, 2007 2:19:09 PM From smelly valentine Adriana to Ralph's beating of Betty Crocker, one could always count on the Bing for entertainment. It beat Artie's restaurant, Tony's backyard, and Melfi's therapy hands down. What's more, it will always be sacred because A&E cannot show the pole dancers. | Jun 4, 2007 2:21:24 PM If that "Rat [removed]" Phil isn't hit next week, give me his 20 and I'll do it myself!! | Jun 4, 2007 2:31:22 PM I am SO sad at the thought of it ending. As someone else said, it was the perfect way to end the weekend. And I looked forward to that opening music. And the ending music was always fabulous too. Carmela, Sil, Pauly, Tony, they were all great. As for the ending - I think this last 8 episodes was just more of Tony dreaming. Tony's dream will continue with everyone dying next Sunday, and then in the last 10 minutes, Tony will wake up and TRULY be a changed man. He will get out of the business - hand it off to someone - and go home and feed his ducks. And that's how it will end - just like it started. Goodbye Sopranos - we'll miss you!! | Jun 4, 2007 2:35:49 PM Has anyone noticed that the final episode of the Sopranos will be episode number 86? Thats why I'm guessing Tony will get 86'd in episode 86. | Jun 4, 2007 2:38:25 PM "Tomorrow I can be on time; you'll be stupid forever." "What's the difference....Italians are Jews with better food." "To think when I went away, an airbag was Paulie Walnuts." | Jun 4, 2007 2:46:46 PM I too thought (hoped, prayed) Furio would show up again when they called in their "cousins" overseas but then Furio wouldn't have messed up the hit the way they did. The only time I've been dissapointed with this show was when Furio left and that was mostly because of the way in which he left the show and not because he was gone. | Jun 4, 2007 3:01:09 PM Last night and this season have been superb. The writing has been second to none. How else do you explain most of us (admit it ) wanting that wimpy little AJ to drown in that pool? Or were happy when Tony tossed him around a little when telling him it was time to leave ? But what has been best this season is that reality has set in.(Most of you have seen Donnie Brasco I'm sure.) Mob life sucks ! It is nothing to look up to or admire. The writers (and even more importantly) the actors are portraying them as the violent scum bags that they really are. (I remember my Italian dad owing lots of money in gambling debts to those types-not a relaxing childhood.) Violence, betrayal, not caring about anyone but yourself. That was Cosa Nostra-please don't forget they ratted each other out back in the 80's. The Sopranos really is the story of the downfall of La Costra Nostra back then. I'm sorry to break it to you folks, but it really is over. | Jun 4, 2007 3:07:53 PM Comments are not posted immediately.

So news that Caravello is suing "Jackass" star , TV talk-show host is either a sign that Caravello has had enough of being a laughingstock or he&#0039;s merely keeping the joke going - shrewd promotion for the little-known movie. Here&#0039;s what allegedly happened: Caravello was led to believe that he was going to be an action film star in a movie called "Windy City Heat." But the actual movie "Windy City Heat" is not an action film but a comedy and Caravello is the punchline - he&#0039;s a gullible wannabe willing to perform every demeaning task asked of him. Could he possibly be as dim as he seems or is "Heat" surreal fake-reality comedy in the tradition of Whatever, Caravello claims he was never paid for his "performance." Fast forward to the DVD release and , the king of idiot stunts, allegedly promises Caravello $10 million last fall if he would agree to place his genitals in a mousetrap while plugging the DVD on Carolla&#0039;s radio show. It hurts just writing about it. "Plaintiff agreed to do so, and, much to his emotional tranquility and to his physical harm, was severely injured when the trap literally went on his manhood," his suit contends. Well, what did he think would happen? He&#0039;s lucky it didn&#0039;t snap his head off. Caravello&#0039;s suit also claims he was humiliated when clips of the incident, which he says were filmed without his permission, made it to the Internet. Tattle hates to assume, but we&#0039;re guessing it was also a bit humiliating when he was hopping around a radio studio attached to a mousetrap. Thank goodness he wasn&#0039;t asked to put his wiener in a The suit, filed Thursday in L.A., alleges fraud, negligence and unjust enrichment. It claims that Caravello signed a contract with Kimmel&#0039;s Dakota North Entertainment but that Kimmel, Knoxville and others never paid Caravello or gave him an accounting of profits and royalties from DVD sales of "Windy City Heat." It seeks a total of $10.5 million in damages - and perhaps some warm lube. * In a statement to Dwayne &#0039;The Rock&#0039; Johnson announced he and his wife of 10 years, They have a 5-year-old daughter, "We&#0039;ve been fortunate enough to spend the last 17 years together as a couple and look forward to spending the rest of our lives together as best friends and business partners," the statement said.

'Knocked Up' delivers laughs By L. Kent Wolgamott Monday, June 4, 2007 10:20 AM CDT Socially inept stoner meets hot television babe in a club. They drunkenly tumble into bed. She's appalled in the morning. A few weeks later, she discovers she's pregnant. That unlikely scenario is the basis of "Knocked Up," this summer's R-rated comedy from writer-director Judd Apatow, the man behind "The 40 Year-Old Virgin." A take-off of sorts from that picture, "Knocked Up" stars Katherine Heigl of ABC's "Grey's Anatomy" as Alison Scott, an E! network producer who finally gets her shot in front of the camera. Celebrating her promotion, she goes out clubbing with her married sister Debbie (Leslie Mann) and is rescued from an uncomfortable encounter by Ben Stone (Seth Rogen, who played Cal in "Virgin.") Layabout stoner Ben and his equally worthless friends see themselves as Internet entrepreneuers. But they're actually putting together a site that provides details on nudity in movies and have failed to check out the competition that's already on the Web. The picture's pivotal moments come when Alison tells Ben that she's expecting and he instantly decides he's going to stick around and be a dad. His choice is more than a little surprising and it sets off one of the many streams of humor that pour from the screen. To say that Ben has to go through a maturing process is an understatement. And he can't even turn to his dad (Harold Ramis) for help. Meanwhile, Alison is grappling with issues of her own, trying to hide her pregnancy from E! execs while becoming ever more confused because she's actually finding hairy schlub Ben to be kind of appealing. That's much of the charm of the very funny "Knocked Up." As deftly played by Rogen, Ben is a nice, if, shall we say, less than motivated guy who begins to find his niche while others remain appalled by him and his behavior. Apatow keeps things loose throughout. It's obvious that much of the film's fast-flying dialogue is improvised as the director trusts his cast, many of whom he's worked with in the past, to be funny while telling the story. There are subplots galore as well. Each of Ben's roommates/partners gets a little story as do Debbie and her husband Pete (Paul Rudd), who she suspects of having an affair. All those stories contribute to the film's two-hour-plus running time. Given that it's basically a romantic comedy with a predictable story arc, "Knocked Up" could have been trimmed significantly without doing much damage to its central story. But that kind of editing would have drastically cut down on the laughs, which start early and continue through most of the movie. That's a sharp contrast to most romantic comedies, which start out funny and wind up stuck in the mush. As was the case with "The 40 Year-Old Virgin" and "Wedding Crashers," "Knocked Up" benefits from its R rating. This is an adult comedy with adult themes that would have been blanded to the usual level of boredom had Apatow shot for the PG-13 that most filmmakers covet in order to gain the widest possible audience. To its credit, "Knocked Up" doesn't make any attempts at delivering any kind of social/cultural/political message. It's just a funny movie about a mismatched couple brought together by an accidental pregnancy - with the emphasis on funny. "Knocked Up" is rated R for sexual content, drug use and language. L.

Perry Caravello is attempting to sue the actor, talk show host Jimmy Kimmel and radio star Adam Corolla for $10.5 million (£5.3 million) after they allegedly promised him $10 million to put his genitals in a mousetrap. The incident then later appeared on the internet, whilst Caravello has reportedly not been paid. Legal papers filed at the Supreme Court in LA said that the actor "agreed to [partake in the stunt]and, much to his emotional tranquillity and to his physical harm, was severely injured when the trap literally went on his manhood". Caravello is also contending that the stunt was filmed without his permission.

It's his first for Starbucks' new record label Hear Music, another sign of the deterioration of the major-label system. It's the 64-year-old's first album available for digital download, another sign of the growing strength of Internet distribution. It's also his first album since his messy breakup from his wife, Heather Mills, but those looking for clues about that will be sorely disappointed, since the album was written before their relationship-troubles began. In the end, though, none of that really matters. What does matter is "End of the End," an elegant, poignant new ballad about death that stands among the best of his solo career. "On the day that I die I'd like bells to be rung and songs that were sung to be hung out like blankets that lovers have played on and laid on while listening to songs that were sung," McCartney sings in his sweetest voice atop a beautiful piano melody, while building a case for the afterlife. It's the most direct song in this series about looking back over his life, which also includes the rocking single "Ever Present Past" and the wistful "Vintage Clothes" and "That Was Me." And it makes "Memory Almost Full" - which isn't as strong as 2005's excellent "Chaos and Creation in the Backyard" (Capitol), but still one of his most consistent albums in years - a worthy addition to his historically impressive catalog. . Paul McCartney looks back and moves forward. In stores today. Grade: B+. Though she's only 19 years old, Rihanna is a hitmaker from the old school, when teams of songwriters and producers pulled together to roll out hot singles and new albums with assembly-line precision. And on "Good Girl Gone Bad" (Def Jam), the Barbados native's third album release in less than two years, she finds her groove. Whether it's the epic-sounding, feel-good hip-hop of "Umbrella" with Jay-Z or the playful, edgy pop of "Breakin' Dishes" or the sweet, "Irreplaceable"-ish duet with Ne-Yo, "Hate That I Love You," Rihanna makes them all work with her pretty little voice and lighthearted vocal delivery. She must have learned her lesson from last year's uneven "A Girl Like Me" album and sidestepped all the sappy ballads in favor of upbeat dance numbers, mid-tempo ballads and island-tinged winners such as "Lemme Get That" and "Sell Me Candy." That makes "Good Girl Gone Bad" an album that is easy to listen to without being easy-listening bland, one of those rare pop collections where every song is a potential hit. ("Good Girl Gone Bad," in stores today; Grade: B+) . Chris Cornell goes solo on "Carry On" (Interscope/Suretone) with rock ranging from the Bond movie theme "You Know My Name" to a dirge-like, yowling cover of "Billie Jean"; Dream Theater's "Systematic Chaos" (Roadrunner); Bruce Springsteen and The Sessions Band capture the Pete Seeger tour on "Live in Dublin" (Columbia); O.A.R. captures its most recent tour on "Live from Madison Square Garden" (Atlantic); Country's hottest duo Big & Rich return with "Between Raising Hell and Amazing Grace" (Warner Bros.); Marilyn Manson's less-shock, more-rock "Eat Me, Drink Me" (Nothing/Interscope); Daddy Yankee's "El Cartel: The Big Boss" (Interscope); Poison's covers album "Poison'd" (Capitol); a tribute album to June Carter Cash "Anchored in Love" (Dualtone), including Elvis Costello doing "Ring of Fire"; a tribute album to Ella Fitzgerald "We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song" (Verve), including Queen Latifah doing "The Lady Is a Tramp"; and, at long last, the Afghan Whigs' greatest hits album "Unbreakable: A Retrospective 1990-2006" (Rhino), including two new songs from the underappreciated indie-rock masters. SONG(S) OF THE WEEK . Lil Mama is already building a teen audience with her hip-hop-cheerleader ode to that makeup staple "Lip Gloss" (Jive), which could grow into this summer's "Hollaback Girl." But the 17-year-old rapper from East New York is set to make her name with a pair of high-profile remixes. Her rhymes on the remix of Avril Lavigne's "Girlfriend" (RCA) cuts the shrieky quotient and raises the hip factor by turning Lavigne into simply the hook singer. On the remix of Rihanna's "Umbrella" (Def Jam), she replaces Jay-Z and manages to hold her own - a sure sign Lil Mama is gonna be something big.

( ) , violated its indecency regulations in two incidents. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted the petition for review filed by Fox and other broadcasters. The court said the FCC failed to articulate a reasoned basis for its change in policy sanctioning "fleeting expletives." Fox argued in December that the FCC acted capriciously and contrary to its prior standards when it found two network broadcasts indecent because of unscripted swearing by celebrities. The three-judge panel agreed, vacating the order and remanding the matter to the FCC for further proceedings consistent with its opinion.

They&#8217;re Animals! - New York Times Television Review | 'Creature Comforts' You Hear Those People? Theyre Animals! Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: June 4, 2007 Creature Comforts, a new stop-motion animation series on CBS, is from the British outfit that has given us the characters of Wallace and Gromit and the clever film Chicken Run. In the new show, clay animals with human voices make various observations about attraction, doctors  life. It may seem an odd thing to say, but Creature Comforts reminds me in some tiny way of The Sopranos because just as it is always unfailingly funny when mob men and their coterie speak of Moby-Dick and the human condition, it makes you laugh when a fake pig, speaking as a middle-aged woman, talks about losing weight. Skip to next paragraph &#147;Creature Comforts&#148; molds interviews into clay animations. , tonight at 8, Eastern and Pacific times; 7, Central time. Kit Boss, Miles Bullough, Ellen Goldsmith-Vein, , David Sproxton and Peter Lord, executive producers; Richard Goleszowski, supervising director. Produced by Aardman Animations Ltd. Based on a British show, Creature Comforts is a feat of audio editing. Its lines are taken from man-on-the-street interviews with hundreds of Americans. A British brain trust. Man-on-the-street-interviews. Ostensibly ordinary Americans. You know where this is going dont you? The British continue to view us not with the greatest munificence. Though it displays far less aggression, Creature Comforts exists as a sort of affectionate Borat, making fun of unsophisticated Americans, as it leaves you feeling not quite as complicit in the exploitation. The animation spares you from all that; youre not looking at actual people saying silly things, after all. The voices are detached. What you are looking at is a hippopotamus hooked up to an I.V. device and complaining about medical care. (Its always skinny girl who is going to weigh you in, the hippo says in a womans voice. For sure. Its going to be some Ally McBeal looking girl who is going to weigh you.) Creature Comforts, which makes its debut tonight, is an unusually snooty show for CBS even as it pretends to be something else. It plays to the knowing and deviously tries to keep you from believing youre a snob. More Articles in Arts &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Johnny Knoxville sued by victim of stunt BY: Actress Archives | Sunday, June 3, 2007 It's something that you may have wondered about in the past - why don't the Jackass guys get sued for more of their violent behavior, especially when a stunt goes wrong? Now they are, as is being sued for a whopping $10.5 million after the victim of one of his stunts claims that he wasn't paid for a very painful stunt that he did to promote a film that he worked on with Jimmy Kimmel. Perry Caravello doesn't just blame , star of both Jackass movies and The Dukes of Hazzard. Perry Caravello claims that radio show hosts Jimmy Kimmel and Adam Corolla promised him that he would get paid an amazing $10 million if he put his genitals in a mousetrap. It sounds painful, sure, but $10 million for a stunt? It sounds like there was a miscommunication somewhere. Perry Caravello not only alleges lack of payment and severe pain, but he also claims in the suit that he was humiliated when footage of the incident appeared on the internet. It's unclear if Caravello wasn't informed that the footage would be posted, didn't know he was being taped, or simply wasn't informed and felt abused when the footage appeared. , Jimmy Kimmel, and Adam Corolla all have yet to comment on the situation. Perry Caravello claims that he was to be paid by Jimmy Kimmel for his work on the 2003 film Windy City Heat and that promised payment if he promoted the film's DVD release on Adam Corolla's radio show. That's where the genitals of Mr. Caravello met the mousetrap. In the papers filed by the Los Angeles Superior Court, Caravello claims that he " agreed to do so and, much to his emotional tranquility and to his physical harm, was severely injured when the trap literally went on his manhood. " The legal action also mentions that he never gave permission to be filmed and was never paid for or given an account of the profits and royalties from DVD sales of the film, something he apparently was due for promoting in such a horrific manner. is most well-known for his work on MTV's Jackass and the two movies that followed but he also appeared in Coyote Ugly, Big Trouble, Men in Black II, Walking Tall, A Dirty Shame, Lords of Dogtown, The Dukes of Hazzard, and The Ringer.

The defense used the e-mails and letters in cross-examining a deputy medical examiner, Dr. Louis Pena, about his finding that Clarkson death from a gunshot fired in her mouth was a homicide, not a suicide. Pena said he did not see most of the material, and when questioned about most of it, said it would not have changed his opinion. Clarkson, an actress best known for her role in Roger orman's 1985 cult classic "Barbarian Queen," was 40 when she died in Spector's foyer after going home with him from her job as a nightclub hostess on Feb. 3, 2003. Clarkson's letters to friends and a doctor in preceding months were read aloud by a defense attorney. They included the phrases "I'm at the end of my rope here" and "I was at the end of my tether." To one friend she wrote, "You know me, Polly Positive. But (expletive) this year has been the worst. I began to question my talent. ... I've been questioning myself as much as I have ever done." Spector Coroner: Lana Clarkson Had Gunshot Residue on Hands Phil Spector Denies Killing Actress in Home Video Chauffeur Says He Saw Spector With Gun and Actress' Body, and Fled Third Woman Testifies Spector Threatened Her With Gun Judge Declines to Punish Spector Lawyers -- for Now Prosecution, Defense Make Opening Arguments in Phil Spector Murder Trial In letters and medical records introduced by the defense there was an indication she was plagued by constant headaches and for a time could not function because of them. She had also been on strong prescription narcotic medications but in her later communications she said she had discontinued them and had stopped drinking. She also wrote at one point, "This has been definitely the most difficult year of my life. My finances are a shambles and I am on the verge of losing everything." Pena said he had not seen any of these documents. "Did you see any reports when Ms. Clarkson in 2002 went to someone to get her subconscious repositioned," asked attorney Christopher Plourd. "Would you like to know about that?" Plourd asked. Clarkson also wrote about how in late 2001 she broke both wrists, including 22 fractures, was hospitalized and was on disability for an extended period. Plourd asked Pena whether Clarkson's shooting could have been accidental and showed him notes he wrote during a meeting with prosecutors on Oct. 14, 2003. Explaining the notes, Pena said, "I'm saying accidental discharge is difficult to determine ... guns don't go off accidentally in a mouth. Someone has to pull the trigger." In the same notes, he said, "Women do not usually shoot themselves. Women are more likely to ... overdose." At the end of the document he noted he wanted to collect more data on women who shoot themselves. But Pena testified he was too busy to follow through. In redirect questioning, prosecutor Alan Jackson read the entirety of the letters and e-mails, saying they needed to be placed in context. "I really feel like I'm losing it. I'm kind of feeling like giving up the dream and therefore the struggle," said one letter. Jackson asked Pena if that sounded like an actress contemplating giving up career goals rather than suicide. The judge's ruling on Clarkson's writings about the 1930s suicide involved a document from her computer that had been characterized as having accounts of her having visions of the long-dead actress. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler on Friday indicated he would likely allow the material, but after reading it during the weekend he returned to court and sternly indicated he found it so different than the defense characterizations that he checked to see if he had the right document. Although the defense said its computer experts found that the document had been worked on or saved as recently as 2001, the judge said it was not a diary and the most recent life story material was from 14 years before Clarkson's death. He read aloud the passage about the 1930s actress, which showed that a Clarkson roommate had a friend who was "psychic" and wouldn't come into their home because of "the presence." Clarkson wrote that she decided to investigate and found a Hollywood history book with an account of Broadway actress Aleta Alexander, who shot herself to death in a yard at the same address after being unable to get movie roles and learning her husband was spending time with other women. Clarkson wrote that on a few occasions she and others saw a shadowy figure move through the yard but found no one when they went to investigate. She noted she had the "feeling" several times that someone was in the house. "It stands to reason as we were struggling actors," said the passage, which the judge noted ended with an exclamation point. "And this is important how?" the judge asked the defense before declaring that nothing in the document was relevant. Spector, 67, rose to fame with the hit-making "Wall of Sound" recording technique in the 1960s.

A Sneak Peek at Paul McCartney's New Release Published June 04, 2007 Really Really Good: Gemini Music Month Music Review: Gerald Collier  How Can There Be Another Day? Concert Review: Watermelon Slim And The Workers  Route 66 Road House, Oklahoma City, OK 06/01/2007 This Tuesday, June 5, 2007, Paul McCartney&#39;s newest album, will be released and BC Magazine is proud to be able to give you a sneak peek at this highly anticipated first release from Starbucks Hear Music label. The album is also a follow-up to McCartney's critically praised and Grammy nominated Chaos and Creation in the Backyard . Though the album received many accolades, McCartney felt Capitol did not promote it as well as they could have and left the label. In a recent press release concerning McCartney confides he actually stalled work on this album to record . "The first recording session was back in the autumn of 2003 at Abbey Road with my touring band and producer David Kahne. I was right in the middle of it when I began talking with Nigel Godrich about a brand new project (which became Chaos And Creation In The Backyard ). After the Grammy nomination when everything concerning was finished I returned to making this album. I was wondering if I would enjoy it, but actually I really loved it." The album is thirteen tracks, and can be heard in streaming format. Continue reading to see notes on each track from Paul McCartney, taken from a recent press release, and also hear audio streams and watch video streams from The song is the first single from and will be released to radio June 18, but you don&#39;t have to wait until then to hear this upbeat number sure to remind you of past great McCartney songs. An audio stream of The song has a very light and cheerful feel, and features a mandolin, an instrument McCartney says he discovered in one of his favorite guitar shops, and enjoyed fiddling around with and learning to play. "I fell in love with this song and with the mandolin. The song kind of wrote itself. I thought I&rsquo;m just gonna keep it simple," McCartney says. Below is the video, hosted on Youtube. Of this song, McCartney says, "Sometimes I just sit down and try and write a pop song. I&rsquo;ve done it throughout my life and it&rsquo;s an interesting thing to do, to make something kind of catchy that might be attractive." And a catchy little pop tune it is. Against a contagious melody are lyrics that speak of how lives move in a circular motion, ever mindful of and affected by their personal past. Listen to the audio stream The song exudes warmth &mdash; yes, sunshine &mdash; in the melody, instrumentation, and tempo. Its tone is fun and carefree and completely fitting of the light happy lyrics. "I was going where I wouldn&rsquo;t normally go, throwing in notes, but somehow it fit. I think I only did two takes, it&rsquo;s mad like that, but those were the ones that we used," said McCartney. Listen to the audio stream &ldquo;Only Mama Knows&rdquo; really is like a short story. I&rsquo;ve done that in the past, not always writing from a personal perspective. So it&rsquo;s kind of nice because you get more into your imagination and that&rsquo;s something I enjoy," McCartney says about this song. The lyrical story format is not the only similarity to his classic "Eleanore Rigby. It has that same eerie and mystical feeling to it &ndash; and a definite seventies rock feel. Listen to the audio stream McCartney reflects saying the song is about memories of summer&#39;s past. "I started off just remembering summers. &lsquo;Were we really there?&rsquo; &lsquo;Was it real?&rsquo; Sometimes for a lot of people your memories, particularly childhood memories, seem so golden and you think &lsquo;did it really never rain all summer or am I just imagining the sunny bits?" But, at least for this listener, you have to dig deep to feel anything warm and happy. The melody and tempo lends itself to the reminiscing, but McCartney&#39;s voice is almost mournful. When you do peel the layers back and listen to it a few times, it all comes together. What he captures with this track is the light fog we look back at the past through, similar to what is left behind by the cool rain on a window in the summer. Listen to the audio stream Another song that is a layered story wrapped around an interesting character. "Mr. Bellamy" is also one of those songs that seems to harken back to the seventies classic rock style. I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s retro, or set it the past as much as it pays tribute to the roots of this songwriter and musician. It&#39;s a fun little track. "Who is Mr Bellamy? I never know who these people are. &lsquo;Who are Chuck&rsquo;n&rsquo;Dave from &ldquo;When I&rsquo;m 64?&rdquo; &lsquo;Who is Eleanor Rigby?&rsquo; &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s Desmond and Molly from &ldquo;O?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t know. I make them up," McCartney explains. Listen to the audio stream "So on this track I was just thinking of how much there is to be grateful for in life and I wanted to put that into song and use this voice to do it with," says McCartney. The voice he&#39;s referring to is what he calls his ballad voice, but the song isn&#39;t what I would call a typical ballad. It&#39;s has a funky style &ndash; one I&#39;m not sure anyone else could pull of so effectively. Listen to the audio stream Life is circular. If you don&#39;t believe that just look at the fashion industry. Not that long ago I would have never believed bell bottom jeans would get a second chance at being chic. But what the song seems to say is don&#39;t hold on to those clothes in hopes they will get a second shot at glory. In other words, look ahead not back. McCartney explains, "For me "Vintage Clothes" is about my clothes from the '60s and the fact that what&rsquo;s out comes back, fashion going round in circles... It&rsquo;s sort of saying don&rsquo;t hold onto the past. The message of; vintage clothes are great but don&rsquo;t live in the past." Listen to the audio stream McCartney explains, "So all I had to do for this song was to think back. And immediately I go back to Liverpool where there was a little place we could escape to, beautiful little woods." But you don&#39;t need an explanation from the songwriter to understand this funky little trip down memory lane. It&#39;s a fun track that strolls through; not only his personal memories, but many of them are the universal rites of passage. Listen to the audio stream "Feet In The Clouds" The song has a nostalgic theme similar to "That Was Me," with a very different over-all tone. Again, the song seems to dig back to not only past memories but musically it seems to revisit some classic McCartney styles. "The song is like a therapy session for me. I wanted to go robotic on some harmonies, to do a vocoder type thing because it&rsquo;s kind of a nostalgic sound and yet it&rsquo;s robotic," says McCartney. Listen to the audio stream McCartney describes the song, "It&rsquo;s quite surreal lyrically. So I enjoyed singing them [lyrics] because of those chords and the mixture of the melody and the lyrics. I think this will be good to do live." It has a massive, epic orchestration to it and does have a very dreamlike tone. It&#39;s a sharp contrast to many of the uplifting and fun melodies, but interesting and enjoyable nonetheless. Listen to the audio stream "End of The End" Not only signaling the end of this collection, this song also deals with the end of life. A &#39;last will&#39; of sorts making funeral arrangements and plans for an after-life, the song still somehow finds a way to be uplifting and hopeful. It&#39;s a deep and weighty subject but McCartney explains, "I remember once an Irish woman wished me well by saying &lsquo;I wish you a good death&rsquo; and I was like, &lsquo;Say what!?&rsquo; I thought about it and thought actually it&rsquo;s a great thing to wish someone. It was quite a brave subject for me." Listen to the audio stream "Well that &lsquo;End of The End&rsquo; brought the party down didn&rsquo;t it? "End of The End" was going to be the last track on the album but then we thought we can&rsquo;t leave everyone going &lsquo;oh god, I&rsquo;m not going to listen to that again.&rsquo; So we had a little stompy rocker called &lsquo;Nod Your Head&rsquo; and we thought, we&rsquo;ve just got to let them off the hook," observes McCartney. Stompy rocker is a very good over-all description. Nothing heavy or reflective to the lyrics, but an enjoyable little ride just the same. It&#39;s short at 1:58, but it&#39;s the perfect way to close out Listen to the audio stream at iTunes by clicking on the image to the right. The album is also available at Amazon.com and all the usual places you buy music as well as all Starbucks&#39; locations. Of McCartney&#39;s now 21 solo albums, this is the first to be offered in a digital format and will be released June 4 in the U.S., June 5 in the U.K. and June 6 in Japan.

http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_6052869&cid San Jose Mercury News - 'Pirates' sinks but stays on top with $43.2 million weekend san jose / valley start / stop paper (From the last 24 hours) Southwest jet skids after landing gear collapses in Oakland Parents of TB patient are 'in hell' Informant helped bust alleged JFK plot Roadshow: Value of carpool lanes in dispute, but more on way Kawakami: Blame must fall on Giants' G.M. Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic 'Pirates' sinks but stays on top with $43.2 million weekend By DAVID GERMAIN AP Movie Writer Article Launched: 06/03/2007 10:27:29 AM PDT LOS ANGELES- "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" hit an ebb tide in its second weekend but still had enough buoyancy to hold the No. 1 spot at the box office. With a $43.2 million weekend, Disney's blockbuster sequel sank a steep 62.4 percent from its $114.7 million opening a week earlier, according to studio estimates Sunday. Universal's romantic comedy "Knocked Up," starring Katherine Heigl as a career woman who gets pregnant from a one-night stand with a slacker (Seth Rogen), debuted a strong No. 2 with $29.3 million. The movie's weekend gross equaled its entire production budget. "It looks like a lot of people wanted to get knocked up this weekend," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers. MGM's thriller "Mr. Brooks," with Kevin Costner as a mild-mannered businessman who moonlights as a serial killer, premiered in fourth place with $10 million. Picturehouse's sports tale "Gracie," featuring Elisabeth Shue in a film inspired by tragic events in her own life and her teenage days as the only girl on a boys soccer team, opened at No. 7 with $1.4 million. The big drop for "Pirates of the Caribbean" was typical of summer flicks that open to colossal numbers. In the second weekend, Sony's "Spider-Man 3" tumbled 62 percent from its record $151.1 million debut, while DreamWorks Animation's "Shrek the Third" fell 57 percent from its $121.6 million opening. While big films once had longer shelf life, most blockbusters today aim to pack in the crowds the first weekend before audiences move on to the next hit. By the second weekend, most people who wanted to catch a big movie already have seen it. "It's exactly where I expected it," said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney. "Once you get everybody who is that avid, crazy fan that's going to see it the first week, then you rely on people who never go out the first week and the people who just come back and back and back." With its mix of serious themes and bawdy humor, director Judd Apatow's "Knocked Up" became a rare R-rated comedy to click with a mainstream audience, much as his "The 40-Year-old Virgin" did two years ago. Most Hollywood comedies have a softer tone to land a PG-13 rating. "This could not be reduced to PG-13 just to get a broader audience. It would have lost the beauty of the whole film," said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal. "It's amazing how Judd hits the exact buttons of what average people go through in their lives." Overseas, "At World's End" did an additional $105.4 million over the weekend to bring its worldwide total to $625.3 million. Domestically, the movie has grossed $216.5 million, trailing last summer's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," which had a $135.6 million opening and had taken in $258.4 million after its second weekend. "Shrek the Third" took in $26.7 million domestically to lift its total to $254.6 million. It is rolling out gradually overseas. With $7.5 million, "Spider-Man 3" padded its domestic haul to $318.3 million. Worldwide, "Spider-Man 3" has taken in $844 million, surpassing 2002's "Spider-Man" ($821 million) to become the biggest hit in Sony's history. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC. Final figures will be released Monday. 1. "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," $43.2 million. 2. "Knocked Up," $29.3 million. 3. "Shrek the Third," $26.7 million. 4. "Mr. Brooks," $10 million. 5. "Spider-Man 3," $7.5 million. 6.

McCartney ditched EMI after 43 years in March - his latest album Memory Almost Full is being released on coffee chain Starbucks' new record label Hear Music tomorrow. When Aspinall quit his position as Apple boss in April, many assumed the two events were connected, something McCartney denies. He says, "(Neil) wanted to retire. Simple as that. "I've known Neil longer than I've known anyone in the music business, including all the Beatles. Neil was at my school when we were 11, he was in my class. "But he just wanted to retire. He's 65." © Thomas Crosbie Media, 2007.

But it gets seriously derailed when a drunken one-nighter with slacker Ben Stone (Rogen) results in an unwanted pregnancy. Faced with the prospect of going it alone or getting to know the baby's father, Allison decides to give the lovable doof a chance. An overgrown kid who has no desire to settle down, Ben learns that he has a big decision to make with his kid's mom-to-be: will he hit the road or stay in the picture? Courting a woman you've just "Knocked Up," however, proves to be a little difficult when the two try their hands at dating. As they discover more about one another, it becomes painfully obvious that they're not the soul mates they'd hoped they might be. With Allison's harried sister Debbie (Mann) and hen-pecked brother-in-law Pete (Rudd) the only parenting role models the young lovers have, things get even more confusing. Should they raise the baby together? What makes a happy lifetime partnership after all? A couple of drinks and one wild night later, they've got nine confusing months to figure it out... Knocked Up (2007) Movie Review: Knocked Up proves predictability isn't necessarily a strike against a movie. Almost from the beginning, with the help of what I caught from commercials, I knew exactly where this comedy was going -- an accidental pregnancy would turn some man-child into someone more mature and understanding, with the raunchy comic situations balanced by an inevitable sweet center. But this movie got me anyway, and got me good, thanks to the creative forces behind it. In his sophomore feature, writer/director Judd Apatow shows he's a force to be reckoned with. It's no accident The 40-Year-Old Virgin was such a big hit, given Apatow's skillful handling of the now reliable formula combining comic bawdiness and sentimentality. Knocked Up is actually better and tighter (though still longish at 2 hours and 9 minutes), its writing ratcheted up to the level of the most well-written comedies of the past. The fast, funny dialogue comes across as artificial enough for us to appreciate the work in writing it and yet real enough to feel believable. Most importantly, though, Apatow's belief in his characters shows through. We have Ben (Seth Rogen), the irresponsible protagonist slob who's lucky to run into a beautiful woman at a club, one who likes him just enough when drunk to take him home for a one-night stand. Ben is a prototypical lovable pot-smoking slacker, although Apatow is brave enough to take him to the edge of unlikeability due to how extreme his slacking is. He's the guy who wouldn't grow up, and then some, but instead of translating that personality through schtick antics, Rogen's performance is more grounded and capable of generating pathos. But even with the extra calibration in writing this character, Ben is one of a long line; thus, the real surprise here is the equally important female lead, Alison, played by Katherine Heigl. In Knocked Up, the women are also rebelling against adulthood, especially in the case of Alison's sister Debbie (Leslie Mann), whose marriage to Pete (Paul Rudd), another guy not ready to grow up, and two children weigh down her fantasies of dancing the night away in clubs while attracting young men. The generally responsible Alison is nonetheless led by her sister into believing she's still able to enjoy her own youth, an idea which, of course, is tested by the pregnancy. Heigl is a revelation in this role, which also asks for complex reactions from the audience -- we like her, but we also see her flaws. Her performance is solid and credible, which is key in getting us to believe she could even fall for a guy like Ben. The primary cast of four, which includes Mann and Rudd, have a strong chemistry, and one can't help acknowledging Apatow as the master chemist. He really knows how to guide his cast through this territory of adults as thwarted Neverland children, knows how to make the story frank and hilarious along the way, and should be considered leader of the pack in presenting this material successfully as a writer and director. In giving the sisters a bond and Ben and Pete an eventual one, Apatow creates the setup for a battle of the sexes, yet thankfully he doesn't just blindly go down this road. In showing each point of view as understandable, he shows he's interested in his characters' humanity, and allowing that makes both the drama and comedy feel more keen. Even though his creations exhibit extremes on both ends -- the males are boorish and the women controlling -- his movie believes them to be everyday people, and like everyone else, they are victims to the old John Lennon line, "Life is what happens to you while you're busy making other plans," which makes them identifiable and sympathetic. That's why predictability doesn't matter anymore in Apatow's case. He makes these basic situations as humane and as funny as you'd expect, and he makes it look effortless. As Roger Ebert has always said, it's not what the movie is about, it's how it is about it. From now on, if I ever doubt that, Knocked Up will be there to remind me. to rate this movie Site Contents Copyright Real Movie News unless used with permission.

The new "Battlestar" shocked fans of the old series with its new, darker reimagining and drew a whole new audience into the battle between humanity and the Cylons. Official word came Friday. The rumors are true. Season 4 will be the end of the series. Just 20 (or so) episodes to draw it all to a close. In a press conference, producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick talked about their plans for the end of the show. The duo was very clear that the show was conceived with a clear end point in mind. Ronald Moore said that the show was ultimately about a ragtag group of survivors setting out for the nearly impossible goal of finding Earth, and arriving at that goal was the planned end. Ending a show as a creative decision is always a preferable choice to a forced ending as ratings start to slide, and both Moore and Eick were very positive and upbeat as they discussed what&#39;s in store for us in the final season and beyond. Though unsurprisingly circumspect about the specifics, they did confirm that the show will arrive on earth eventually. Will the ending be similar to the original show? Aside from some jokes about flying motorcyles in development, no. This is a different story, and will come to a very different end. For which I think we can all breathe a sigh of relief. Of course the trip to earth is focused on Roslin as the prophet, but as to whether the semi-religious figure will see the arrival on earth, well, you&#39;ll just have to wait and see. Will there be an explanation for the sudden appearance of a contemporary American piece of music in the dramatic end of season 3? You bet. David Eick explained that the use of a piece of contemporary music was discussed as early as the miniseries, and was considered for a moment in Episode 5, but they decided that the idea was so good they would wait for a dramatic moment to give it focus. The producers promised that the reason for that musical anachronism would be explained in the course of season 4. A special two-hour episode, originally designed with DVD release in mind, will air this fall before the regular season begins. The episode will not pick up where season 3 left off; it will be set around the period of "Pegasus" and "Resurrection Ship," following some of the history of the Pegasus before it met up with the Galactica, and continuing on after the death of Admiral Cain. The story is separate from the plot of season 4, but will be tied in to the overall story. There was much discussion of a possible prequel project set on Caprica and following the development of Cylon technology. Nothing is absolutely set at this point, and the SciFi channel hasn&#39;t given it the green light, but discussions are still underway. Despite the lack of any firm commitment from SciFi, Moore and Eick were both extremely enthusiastic about the possibility of a Caprica show. Note to SciFi Channel: So are we. When asked if there was any intention to leave the show open to the possibility of a "Serenity"-style movie, Moore was quick to say that "the plan is to bring it to a definitive conclusion" but that it was hard to know how they would feel after concluding the series. They intend to draw the relationships between characters to a fulfilling conclusion, though the added that some stories might be left tantalizingly open ended. In art, as in life, nothing is wrapped up perfectly. Response from the cast on the impending conclusion was reportedly "mixed", with some cast members agreeing wholeheartedly with the decision to conclude (I think it&#39;s safe to guess Edward James Olmos was among them) and others more surprised by the choice. According to David Eick, there&#39;s a feeling of senior year of high school on the set, with everyone getting ready to sign each other&#39;s yearbooks. After the fiasco of mid-season breaks in the last television season, it&#39;s no surprise that the question of scheduling came up. There&#39;s no hard date for the start of season 4 yet, though they expect early &#39;08. As to the rest of the scheduling? Moore and Eick are leaving it to the SciFi channel. "The truth is that they&#39;re awfully good at their own scheduling," says Moore. They do say that even in the final season they will make a conscious effort not to over-serialize, keeping the show approachable for casual viewers who may not catch every episode. Yeah, good luck with that. The questions were plentiful. Will Lucy Lawless be back? Maybe. Is a Peabody award just a consolation prize for the fact that sci fi shows never get the Emmy nod? No, the Peabody is cool on its own, and who knows, maybe BSG will break out of the Emmy scifi ghetto. Why do they use deleted scenes in the "previously on" intros? Just to bug you. Did "Lost" like, oh my god, totally steal their way cool flash-forward idea? "We often think of them as thieves in the night", Eick jokes. Seriously, will there be flying motorcycles? Only time will tell, but Ronald Moore and David Eick seem certain that they can bring the show to a conclusion that will blow the audience away. With the end in sight, season 4 promises to be absolutely no holds barred on a show that barely barred any holds to begin with. One thing&#39;s for sure; I&#39;ll be watching.

Ask the Answer B!tch Faces in the News pirates of the caribbean: at world's end Sun, 3 Jun 2007 11:12:07 PM PDT The sailing wasn&#39;t quite as smooth for Pirates of the Caribbean: At World&#39;s End this weekend, but the booty was still plentiful. Despite seeing a 62 percent drop from its dominant $114.7 million opening last weekend, the swashbuckling sequel&#39;s $43.2 million was enough to keep it in first place and bring its two-week total to $216.5 million, despite what turned out to be stiff competition from Judd Apatow&#39;s latest offering to the cerebral gross-out genre, according to figures compiled by Exhibitor Relations. Apparently being impregnated by Seth Rogen isn&#39;t as disturbing a concept as &#39;s movie posters would have you believe, with audiences forking over $29.3 million to get in on the unplanned-parenthood shenanigans, giving the well-received R-rated comedy a solid second-place finish at the box office. Things are looking up for the had a $21.4 million opening weekend and went on to gross $109.4 million domestically. With its steep drop-off after an opening that didn&#39;t match either its predecessor or fellow threequels , box-office analysts are predicting that &mdash;despite being on a record number 4,362 screens&mdash;will not match the performance of Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man&#39;s Chest , which had taken in $258.4 million by its second weekend and is still one of only three movies in history to crack $1 billion worldwide. Still, Disney reported that At World&#39;s End has grossed $625.3 million worldwide, becoming the 24th film to surpass $400 million overseas, and the fifth Disney title to achieve that milestone. , meanwhile, opened on 3,700 screens in 2,871 theaters.

Also making a lackluster debut was the sports drama as the mother of a girl who decides to take her beloved brother&#39;s place on their high school&#39;s all-boy soccer team after he&#39;s killed in a car crash. The film, which was directed by Shue&#39;s hubby Davis Guggenheim and is loosely based on her own life, pulled in an uninspiring $1.4 million, despite its heartwarming subject matter. Dropping out of the top 10 completely were the female bonding flick (people would rather read about than watch her, apparently), the cat-and-mouse thriller , which ran out of gas again a brief return to the top 10 last week. Most critics may not have thought much of the road-trip comedy, but it lassoed enough fans to spend 10 out of the past 14 weeks in the top 10 and drive away with $163.6 million. , Nathan Fillion and some really delicious-looking pies, continues to be the little film that could. The Sundance Film Festival darling added another 95 theaters to its lineup and another $2 million to its coffer to bring its five-week total to $9.5 million.

Backers include ABRY Partners, New York Life Capital Partners III, and Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance. The company promises a &ldquo;new business model for bringing licensed games to market.&rdquo; The firm will be based in Atlanta and Los Angeles. It already is working on several titles. Bert Ellis, an executive with the firm, is a former chief executive officer of iXL Enterprises, a defunct Web consulting firm in Atlanta. He also is an investor in Brash Music, a record label based in Atlanta, according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle. In March, the newspaper reported the company would get started with $150 million in funding. Mike McQuary, a former executive with Internet Service Provider EarthLink, is an investor in the firm. Brash&rsquo;s strategy calls for projects to be matched with independent development studios, the company said. Twelve games are already in production, and more than 40 properties have been licensed in deals with five film studios. "Brash is founded on the simple premise that top Hollywood creativity plus top game talent should equal great games," said Brash co-founder, Chairman, and CEO Mitch Davis in a statement. "We are laser focused on delivering high-quality games. The other aspects of our business are left to the experts - best of breed partners we've tapped for their specific expertise." Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group is the distributor for Brash titles. Davis and Nicholas Longano, the chief operating officer, were former executives at Massive Incorporated, which developed an in-game advertising network. Copyright 2007 by WRAL.com.

Like ``The 40-Year-Old-Virgin,&#39;&#39; it successfully mixes raunchy humor and juvenile antics with tender touches and adult conflicts. Writer/director Apatow gives us jokes about masturbation and buying condoms from Costco, yet we also get sweet moments such as the one where penniless Ben (Seth Rogan) gets down on his knee and proposes to Alison (Katherine Heigl) with an empty ring case. You&#39;d expect the mood shifts to be more jolting than they are; Apatow has a knack for melding the light and the serious, and treating them with equal respect. Ben and Alison meet at a Southern California bar where she&#39;s celebrating her promotion to on-air reporter at an entertainment-news network and he&#39;s hanging out with his stoner buddies, who are helping him create an Internet movie guide to nude scenes featuring famous actresses. Alison and Ben get drunk, fall into bed and presto, eight weeks later she discovers she&#39;s pregnant. (She apparently was so wasted she didn&#39;t realize he failed to use a condom.) When Alison decides to have the baby -- the choice seems implausible, given that she just met Ben and they&#39;re complete opposites -- Ben nonchalantly tells her that he&#39;s ``on board&#39;&#39; without having a clue what he&#39;s getting into. And so begins their rocky road to parenthood. While they both have serious reservations about a permanent relationship, Alison and Ben prepare for their impending arrival by shopping for baby books and cribs, as well as a trusted gynecologist -- the latter search taking forever because of Alison&#39;s determination to bond with her doctor. Meanwhile, Ben is bonding with his possible future brother- in-law, Pete (Paul Rudd), a fun-loving, henpecked father of two suspected of cheating by his wife, Debbie (Leslie Mann). Debbie follows her husband to a strange house one night, only to discover that he&#39;s innocently participating in a fantasy- baseball draft with his friends. To escape his wife&#39;s scrutiny, Pete heads to Las Vegas with Ben, where they hire lap dancers and hallucinate on psychedelic mushrooms. Ben returns in time to attend Alison&#39;s drug-free delivery, which comes with so much screaming and cursing that it might serve as an effective method of population control. Though I&#39;m skeptical that a couple like this would last longer than a Madonna hairdo, that didn&#39;t spoil my enjoyment of what is, after all, a Hollywood confection. Apatow&#39;s sharp script and a wonderful ensemble cast make ``Knocked Up&#39;&#39; a knockout. ``Knocked Up,&#39;&#39; from Universal Pictures, is playing across the U.S. (Rick Warner is the movie critic for Bloomberg News.

Anyhow, here&#8217;s a rundown of the conference call Battlestar Galactica exec prods David Eick and Ronald Moore gave to members of the media on Friday. I&#8217;ve grouped the comments by subject, rather than chronologically, as the questions ad answers jumped around quite a bit. Eick said the decision wasn&#8217;t reached lightly and was only made after he and Moore made sure they had determined they could tell the story they had set out to tell. Moore said he and Eick felt the show had reached its &#8220;third act&#8221; and was nearing its conclusion. SciFi asked them to think about it for a while, but &#8220;didn&#8217;t really fight&#8221; them when they came back and said they were ready to end it. The plan is to end the show. The plan is to bring us to a definitive conclusion. There&#8217;s no plans or even thoughts, really, of doing a follow on feature or miniseries or anything like that. Still, he said, &#8220;Never say never because who knows how we&#8217;ll actually feel.&#8221; Plus he said he didn&#8217;t know that every single minute thing on the series would be resolved to the fans&#8217; satisfaction. They might &#8220;leave some things open to the imagination,&#8221; he said. Moore said most of the cast and crew were surprised by the decision, but it depended on the individual. Some &#8220;were ready for its third act,&#8221; he said. Others believed the show had more life in it yet. No matter the case, everyone&#8217;s been looking at this season in a new light. &#8220;Instead of being a step on a journey, it&#8217;s the concluding step.&#8221; Filming is up in Vancouver, B.C., in Canada, and Eick visited the recently. &#8221; It felt like the beginning of senior year up there.&#8221; Usually, a 22-episode season for BSG would have seemed a huge amount of time to fill. This time, it hardly seemed enough. This time it was almost like, OK, let&#8217;s make sure we have enough time to get where we need to go. As for Earth, we&#8217;ll see more of it this season, Moore promised. &#8220;We will get to a place that we will call Earth before the end of the series.&#8221; As for whether we&#8217;ll get to see what that Earth is like, &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a good chance,&#8221; he said. But, he noted, &#8220;We haven&#8217;t written that show yet.&#8221; A possible &#8220;Caprica&#8221; series Readers of this blog (and of anything else BSG-related) know that SciFi had been looking at a new series, &#8220; It would take us back to before the first Cylon war &#8212; to the days when the technology that led to the current Cylons were first created. It would basically take the stories we come to discover in Battlestar Galactica and go all the way back to their embryo. The discovery of the technology that will lead to the Cylons, specifically. Right now, however, it&#8217;s &#8220;not on the front burner,&#8221; Eick said. They&#8217;d still like to do it, though, and suggested those interested call or e-mail SciFi to let the network know of their desires. Moore, asked about the two-hour episode/movie, , to be show in the fall, explained that he and Eick had been approached by the home video folks in between filming the seasons about releasing a couple of episodes on DVD as a standalone movie that still fit in with the storyline. The episodes, he explained, would have to come from the timeline before the cliffhanger ending. They didn&#8217;t want to go back before the series began, but rather to go back a season or two, telling a story that would fill in the time and also connect somehow to Season 4. Eick said they decided to tie the episodes to the story of the Pegasus. Some of the bonus episodes/movie will involve Pegasus&#8217; backstory &#8212; i.e., how it escaped the destruction of the colonies and the rest of the fleet. Other parts will take place after Cain dies. He admitted he sort of regretted having gotten rid of the Pegasus. The &#8220;final four&#8221; Cylons and other tidbits Moore said he and Eick quickly gravitated to the four they eventually decided would be the &#8220;final four&#8221; (no word on who the final fifth is) Tigh, he said, was &#8220;kind of the sexiest,&#8221; as he was a drunk, had spent his entire adult life fighting the Cylons and even killed his wife because of her collaboration with the toasters. Anders, he said, had participated in two resistance movements (on Caprica after the nuclear attack and then again on New Caprica) &#8220;and was drawn to Kara Thrace for reasons unknown.&#8221; Tyrol was one of the &#8220;most human characters.&#8221; They regarded him as the one viewers would be most surprised that he turned out to be a Cylon. But the religious connection in his background and being drawn to the temple on the algae planet helped set the stage. He was drawn there for a reason. He&#8217;s also dreamed about being a Cylon and even fell in love with a Cylon (Boomer, when neither knew she was a Cylon). Tori, the president&#8217;s aide, he said, was &#8220;a wild card.&#8221; We (and Moore and Eick) knew the least about her. That made it more fun, he said, because they wouldn&#8217;t be locked into as many specific choices in exploring her Cylon backstory. And their &#8220;true&#8221; backstories will be delved into, he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re all the same people. They didn&#8217;t switch over and become robots suddenly.&#8221; The four are going to try to figure out what being a Cylon means to who and what they are and they wonder if they are dangers to each other, the ship or others, and if they should keep the secret among themselves. (Number Six) in another pilot for another series he was working on, &#8220; ) about an extraterrestrial sleeper cell. He also used &#8221; pilot and she probably will crop up in future episodes. &#8220;Bionic Woman&#8221; has been picked up and &#8220;Them,&#8221; he said, is &#8220;being flirted with as a mid-season replacement.&#8221; As for the question on many people&#8217;s minds, Eick and Moore had been trying to figure out a way to get &#8220;All Along the Watchtower&#8221; in long before last season&#8217;s finale. Eick said they&#8217;d thought of opening the miniseries with the Simon &#038; Garfunkle&#8217;s &#8220; .&#8221; And in the first season, when Sharon and Helo are in a diner on the now-radioactive Caprica, they toyed with the idea of having The Beatles&#8217; &#8220; &#8221; in a jukebox.

And if only out of fairness to Tracy Morgan, I&#8217;m glad I waited. You see, I came across a blurb at TVGuide.com rehashing a report in The New York Post that Morgan was spotted two weeks ago at Rum Jungle in Las Vegas. The Post cited a witness who claimed Morgan was &#8220;doing shots of vodka, eventually drinking straight from the bottle and partying into the wee hours shirtless.&#8221; The newspaper has apparently , however, after speaking to Morgan&#8217;s lawyer, who put a rep for the company that makes Morgan&#8217;s alcohol-monitoring bracelet on the phone.

http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-spector5jun05,0,4101204.story%3Fcoll%3Dla-home-local&cid Spector's lawyers lose bid to use Clarkson's own words - Los Angeles Times 2:18 PM PDT, June 4, 2007 Buy, Sell & More Deals at Local Stores California | Local News Spector's lawyers lose bid to use Clarkson's own words The judge rejects an effort by the defense to use writings from the dead actress in the cross-examination of a medical examiner. By Michael Muskal, Times Staff Writer 12:54 PM PDT, June 4, 2007 The judge in the Phil Spector murder trial rejected efforts today by the defense to use parts of the apparent diary of Lana Clarkson in the cross-examination of the medical examiner who did an autopsy on the dead actress. Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler said he would not allow the computer document to be used in questioning Deputy Medical Examiner Louis Pena, who returned this morning for a fourth day on the stand. Pena, whose time in the witness box will resume this afternoon, insisted that he stood by his ruling that the death was a homicide. Today's ruling by Fidler was a surprise and a blow to the defense, which had hoped to use the document to undermine Pena and to raise questions about Clarkson's lifestyle. Fidler said the defense could try to introduce the document when it presented its case. Spector, 67, is accused of shooting Clarkson, 40, about 5 a.m. on Feb. 3, 2003, after the music producer spent the night drinking at several restaurants and clubs. Spector met Clarkson a few hours earlier at the House of Blues in West Hollywood, where the actress worked as a hostess for the Foundation Room, the club's VIP area. Fidler's decision was a surprise because he had indicated last week that he was inclined to allow the defense to introduce the document, titled "The Story of My Life." It was found on the hard drive of Clarkson's computer. The defense calls the document Clarkson's diary, a term to which the prosecution has objected. Fidler said he read the document over the weekend. He said it seemed dated, describing events in 1988 or 1989. He asked defense lawyer Christopher J. Plourd what bearing the material could have on Clarkson's death in 2003. "I don't consider anything in this particular document to be significant," Fidler said after the prosecution was unable to answer his questions. "If your experts want to" discuss the document "that's fine. The question was whether Dr. Pena could be cross-examined on this, and I find this to be so irrelevant that the answer is no," Fidler ruled. "You're not going to present it through him, because we'll wait and see if it ever gets presented at all. I find nothing of any probative value whatsoever in this item." Plourd argued the document indicated Clarkson's state of mind, and that the material seemed to jump around in time and could indicate more recent attitudes. He said computer experts say the document was worked on 2001. The ruling was a setback for Spector's defense team, which maintains that Clarkson accidentally shot herself because she was despondent about the decline of her performing career. The defense has called the death an "accidental suicide." But the defense faced a tactical problem in how to introduce evidence to support its contention without attacking Clarkson. By using the cross-examination of a prosecution witness, the defense had hoped to make its points without being in the uncomfortable position of attacking the victim. The document also would have given the defense ammunition to undermine Pena, who rejected the suicide theory when he testified last week and through three days of detail-laden cross-examination by the defense. Pena said he considered the possibility of suicide but decided that Clarkson was a victim of a homicide, in part because there was no evidence that she had been despondent. It also made no sense that Clarkson would go to a stranger's home and somehow find a gun to kill herself, Pena said. Plourd had argued that the computer document showed that Clarkson was despondent about her declining acting career and that she used alcohol and illegal drugs. She was also fascinated by guns, Plourd said. During his cross-examination, Plourd tried to get Pena to change his mind about his homicide ruling, but the coroner stood firm as the lengthy cross-examination ended in the late morning. Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Jackson then took over the questioning and walked Pena through the various e-mails cited by the defense. Jackson read the full messages, trying to show that the defense's interpretation that Clarkson was suicidal was wrong. "Is there any suicidal ideation?" Jackson asked Pena. "No," the coroner replied. After Jackson finishes with Pena, the defense will get another chance to shake the medical examiner. Times staff writers Peter Y. Hong and John Spano contributed to this report.

Judge Larry Paul Fidler said last week that he would likely let defense lawyers use the manuscript in which Clarkson reportedly writes about having visions of a dead actress who killed herself with a gun. A defense attorney says the writings found on Clarkson's computer also include discussions of her fascination with guns, depression over her failing acting career and struggles with alcohol and drugs. The actress died of a gunshot fired inside her mouth in the foyer of Spector's mansion in February 2003. Spector's defense contends Clarkson killed herself. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press.

But this time Nick Park and Aardman Animations Ltd. are working without a net. Specifically, they have no script. Instead, they take real audio recordings of ordinary Americans (many in the first episode, June 4, were apparently taken in doctors' waiting rooms) and put their words in the mouths of stop-motion animals. Sometimes it works, as when a lovebird describes in lengthy detail all the doctors she routinely sees. But more often, it doesn't  no matter how funny the animated characters are to look at. The humor just isn't there. True confession: We laughed out loud at the crude opening scene that uses the audio recording of two men at a wine tasting and puts their words in the mouths of two dogs who are sniffing another dog's rear. But here's the point: The laughs are too few and far between to merit a half-hour's viewing. Next time, a script would be nice.

The Bastard Machine : "Sopranos" Ep. 20: "A glorified crew." Tim Goodman. The Bastard Machine "Sopranos" Ep. 20: "A glorified crew." I think the point to make upfront here is that, in these last two deconstructions of "The Sopranos," we might not even need to go that deep. Everyone will have theories - though I believe the notion of "theories" is coming to an end - and people will have elements to the franchise series they'll want to go on and on about. I may just be getting in the way. That said, at this point, one paragraph in, I can't promise that it will be short. See you on the train, Bobby. The last episode, however, was truly sweet. And also bittersweet. The most impressive part of this rush to the end is that nearly every episode has been taut, informative and fanstastic. In this penultimate episode (which David Chase co-wrote), you can see the veil of surprise, of artistic feints, red herrings, theory-bating and any other cool narrative device totally vanish. It's as if things snuck up on us. Time is not just running out, it's almost all gone. Action needed to step forth and be counted. And so, true to form historically, the second to last episode had more than it's fair share of Big Moments. By the way, I'll say this once and once only - if you haven't seen this episode, turn away now. Sil whacked a guy (don't listen to offers, is the moral of that killing); Sil was later killed (or at least we think so) as was Bobby Bacala. Tony is on the run, holed up in a safe (unsafe?) house with Bacala's Big Ass Gun and Paulie Walnuts and the rest of the least threatening crew you could ever imagine. Strange times. These have been tense episodes of late and Sunday's may have ratcheted things up to unbearable. Give the directors (and the writers) credit for moving things along at a crisp clip, with everything believable and compelling (even if you knew what was coming - the mark of suberb cinematography and storytelling). The Bacala hit at the hobby shop was tipped by the ringing phone in his left-behind jacket, but even when you saw the two guys walk in, the editing of the train and the guys walking down the aisles and Bacala staring dreamily at his "Blue Comet" train coach - it was priceless. Really well done. And credit Bacala for standing tall as long as he could. He took a lot of led. The Sil hit was perfect because there was a routine to it. A simplicity. Get in the car, get out. Cut off. Do what you can to survive. It seems about as simple and true to life as imaginable. The question here is, were you sad about either one? Strangely enough, I wasn't. Not one bit. I think that's part of the point. So here we are, one episode from the end (did you notice that HBO didn't even play coy with the preview - just kept it short and simple, not to give enough away; that said, knowing Phil has surfaced before Tony is dead is a very bad sign for Phil). Almost without thinking about it, a lot of heated theories about where this series is going are now moot, pointless or just out the window. Forgotten even. I still think there will be a lot of unanswered questions in the finale (and we may yet see Tony die) but this unraveling seems about as simple as you could dream it. Two families have a falling out. New York moves on Jersey. The end. Or at least close to it. There are still ramifications. But the basic motivation for closure seems to be a personality clash and a dispute. Very true-to-life as motivation. Very mob-like. Now, we're still open to interpretations, ideas about what's next (does Tony go or stay, is there a backlash in his family-on-the-lam, etc.) Something could still happen with the Feds. A.J. and Carmela are both still in play. Someone from within his own crew could turn. Tony could even slip away (after offing Phil?) to an unknown life. We may never know a lot of things. But why not talk about them? More after the jump: Phil-isms: "Anthony Soprano has no respect for this thing..." "Plain and simple, we decapitate and we do business with whatever's left." (Brilliant!) "I took his fat f-ing hand in friendship." "Guys don't get their finger pricked. There's no sword or gun on the table." "Either it has meaning, or it doesn't." "Five f-ing families and we've got this pygmy thing over in Jersey." And so, off to war. The PBS "Frontline" Iraq doc was timely, no? So, peer pressure works on psychiatrists as well? Clearly Melfi was pushed into some come-to-Jesus realization by Eliot and his constant pushing of the new research about sociopaths and therapy, as discussed in last week's episode as well. I loved the editing of the words as Melfi read in bed at night, believing that seven years of work with Tony was one long professional dupe, that she had herself been sucked into trying to save him, perhaps, or because she was intrigued by him. " The criminal's sentimentality reveals itself in compassion for babies and pets." There's the A.J. and ducks thing. " The criminal uses insight to justify heinous acts ." Yep, that sounds like Tone. And, on therapy: " For criminals it becomes one more criminal operation Credit Tony, at least, for calling Melfi's sudden reversal "immoral" and nailing her (and therapy in general) to the wall on accountability. Tony was reading (and tearing out) Departures magazine. Nice. Good to see Artie Bucco again, even temporarily. I guess his story is that the restaurant business goes on, and rifts with his wife get patched. There certainly seemed to be more there earlier - a lot more - but you can file that as one of a number of storylines that will never see a proper conclusion. Another tip of the hat to simplicity and mere luck (or being unlucky). The normally professional, can't-miss hit men from Italy get the wrong guy. Once that happened, did it not send a chill up your spine? Like, uh-oh. Phil just dodged one and this is all going sideways. I loved how distraction (the guy in the porn store), faulty delegation and the whimsy of bad timing and bad luck - a lot like life - play into the eventual destruction of much of Tony's crew. Mies was right. God is definitely in the details. Uncle Junior's money is out. Unless they re-dig up the backyard, it looks like state care from here on out. Sil: "Paulie wants it known he takes full responsibility. But he didn't do anything." Perfect! Don't ever change, Paulie. Tony was remarkably calm when he was telling his family. He's focused. Professional. And finally threw A.J. around to wake him up (the point was, hell, if you're not going to move on Miss Lovely and instead choose to mope, I may have to throw you into the closet to wake you up. Pack a bag. No resort wear or sandals, please.) One episode left. Tony's holed up, back to the wall, fully automatic machine gun in hand. Knowing that much will be left unresolved, there's this: How does he go out? How does it end? June 04 2007 at 12:43 PM The beginning of the end. Soon...no more guessing. Posted By: hickcity | June 04 2007 at 12:54 PM I barely breathed during the episode. Possibly dumb question - who did Sil whack? Tim, I did feel bad for Bobby. I know he was not blameless, but out of all the crew, he was the one who seemed to revel the least in the brutality and excess of the life. He would have been happy to have been a civilian. Posted By: smckenna752 | June 04 2007 at 12:56 PM Tony with the machine gun behind the door reminds me of Scarface: "Say hello to my little friend". It would be fitting for Tony to be left standing last and alone, going out in a hail of gunfire. Outstanding episode. Posted By: sdv30 | June 04 2007 at 01:00 PM Very suspicious behavior by Paulie, Parisi and Sil, in that order. Suspicious that Phil and his main guys spared Paulie with a less than adequate explanation ("management only"), and suspicious that Paulie sped off somewhere (to tell Phil to go into hiding?) after seeing the hit men. Then Paulie unable to reach Sil all night because his wife had "food poisoning"? Was Sil working with Phil or the Feds? The order to kill that Burt guy didn't come from Tony, so who did it come from? Maybe Burt was an informant and Sil was afraid his own association with the FBI would be revealed, or maybe Sil was working with Phil who had him killed for appearances or to eliminate anyone whose allegiance could later be questioned. Also, we don't know for sure that the call on Bacala's cell phone was a warning call from Sil. Maybe Sil never made that call for a very specific reason. Or maybe he took his time about it. How do we know? Wondering if Janice will bolt and leave the kids to be raised by Carm. Another chance for her to parent? Loved the episode! Great build to the finale! Posted By: tall_chick | June 04 2007 at 01:02 PM I love how Phil puts all the blame on his brother's death on New Jersey when it was New York who ordered and paid for it. Posted By: TimSPC | June 04 2007 at 01:02 PM Nice decon, Tim. I loved the reference to "Raging Bull", when the theme music is playing in the background and Tony and Sil start shadow boxing. A great sly reference to the fact that these are aging dons, about to hit the canvas. It would be funny, if it wasn't so sad. Will Tony sleep with the fishes in the finale? Will he survive? Either way, I don't think it matters. We now see how he has paid for his lifestyle, for his choices. He is a man at the end, whether he "survives" or not. He's lost. Posted By: alibaba3 | June 04 2007 at 01:03 PM Bobby was careless - especially after having stepped up to take care of the matter for Tony. In many ways the beef Phil has with Tony's "crew" is real - loyalties have outweighed skill and ability for too long. Bobby was just such a point in fact. No one, including Paulie, seemed to really pay attention to detail in carrying out Tony's orders on the Phil hit. Its definitely personal for Phil, and now that his goomah has be offed he may try to strike even deeper at the heart before he completes the decapitation. And that may ultimately be his undoing... I was not convinced of this episode's depiction of a "final" meeting with Tony and Dr. Melfi. If that scenne does end up being the final meeting then I must defer from Tim. If anything was rushed in order to usher forward the inevitable conflict that was not a complete moment. Posted By: leake | June 04 2007 at 01:06 PM Flatbush Bikini Waxing. What a butch meeting place (I will NOT say hidey-hole!) for Phil's homophobic crew. Posted By: maenad | June 04 2007 at 01:09 PM The last scene of Tony alone on a bare mattress holding an assault rifle is perfect. I guess that wasn't his childhood room in his mom's old house but it looked like it could be. Posted By: blinky | June 04 2007 at 01:10 PM You know what they say: You live by the model train, you die by the model train... Posted By: UncleBoo | June 04 2007 at 01:16 PM I don't even want to speculate, but I wouldn't bet against Tony even if he's pretty alone now. I watched the last four episodes back to back last night with some friends who hadn't seen eps 17, 18 & 19 (I'd seen them twice) and I'm still pretty gobsmacked today. What an intense ride this has been. It was really clear how well the foundation was laid for all that was to come. ~Some people have commented that Melfi's quiting as Tony's therapist was out of character or forced but I think it was very believable. Her perception of her relationship with him is paralleling our own. Melfi's was seduced by Tony as we all were, felt uncomfortable about it at times but she was also in denial. She is now seeing him for who he really is too --and I think she feels "dirty" for her role in it. She just saw the light, SHE got it. And I thought it was great how he called her on it. He is a smart man, he did learn some things in therapy, but did it ultimately change who he was? We'll see. But Melfi won't. Posted By: suzyq2 | June 04 2007 at 01:16 PM Something dawned on me this morning. As Sil and Patsy were cleaning out the back room at the Bing (right before they got hit), Sil asked Patsy to grab a bunch of paperwork (believe he said "receipts"). Unless I missed it, I think this was still in the backseat of the car in a briefcase as Patsy ran off (where did he get to btw?). Could this be the final info that implicates the NJ "glorified crew"? I need to watch this episode again, as there were so many small things I missed (like the Sil Dante cutout in the safehouse). Posted By: mudcrutch2000 | June 04 2007 at 01:17 PM Don't you think it's possible that Janice will snap out of her "mourning", suspect Tony whacked Bobbie (he had just badmouthed him to Janice a scene or two earlier), and take him out, in revenge for supposedly killing Bobbie and leaving her high and dry, concerning Uncle Junior? Posted By: leahbrooks | June 04 2007 at 01:23 PM Countless fine details in this episode: * Cutting from the violence of Sil's whacking of Bert to Phil stirring his espresso in a very mannered, cultured way. Great filmmaking. * The music in The Bing -- "When The Music's Over". Music is your only friend, until the end. * At home, AJ plopping down in front of the Frontline doc, looking just like Tony doing the same in front of the History Channel. The narration of the show even sounded the same. My speculation: Phil may regret leaving Paulie off the hit list. Paulie may be a loose cannon, but he's Tony's loose cannon. His story has to get wrapped up in some significant way, and I can't help but feel that it has to be central to Tony's. Not that I've forgotten about AJ, mind you... God, I'm gonna miss this show. Posted By: jim_at_sfgate | June 04 2007 at 01:23 PM Is there any realistic possibility that Bert Gervasi tried to flip Silvio over to NY, but somehow didn't first do the same with his own blood cousin (Carlo)? I'd think Carlo would be the first guy he'd go to, even for nothing else but to test the waters before he went to the #2 guy in the family. Carlo certainly has no love for Tony, especially after Tony essentially said he valued Vito (a fanook!) more than him. Carlo killed Fat Dom, hand-to-hand, for less. At the end of the episode, it was Carlo who needed a reason to use his cell phone from the secret new safe house. Maybe the pizza will get delivered by Butchie .... Posted By: blackjack33 | June 04 2007 at 01:26 PM A couple of nice references: Carm, in the elevator going to AJ's hospital room, to Tony - "Only one more week of this..." "The End" by the Doors playing in the Bing. Posted By: jtl46 | June 04 2007 at 01:30 PM At our house we have had the increasingly strong suspicion that Paulie has been playing both sides for a while now. Left off Phil's list...odd that the Italians would screw up something this important...unaccounted for time during this "crisis" ... I read above about Sil maybe being with Phil or the Feds...maybe...but I don't trust Paulie. And there he is in Tony's safe house at the 11th hour... Posted By: trillo_in_marin | June 04 2007 at 01:33 PM As for next week: I always assumed Tony would go while fetching the Star Ledger in his bathrobe from the foot of his driveway. But Burt Gervasi got that treatment, thanks to Sil. Now we've got the Iraq metaphor: Phil Leotardo, who really just wants to avenge his family's name, hopes to quickly decapitate Jersey, figuring he can work with whatever remains. Finishing the George Bush parallel, AJ watches Frontline's segment on Iraqi insurgents. So Tony's now the insurgent, fighting for his life against Phil (which trumps depression any day, at least in the short term). He'll probably prevail, but be left with very little: Paulie Walnuts, an empty house, an empty pool (no place for the ducks to land), and with only the realization that he can fill his father's shoes after all (plenty of shoes in episode 20)--but that's all he can expect. Posted By: sophieluv | June 04 2007 at 01:33 PM SuzyQ2 is dead-on in her take of the Melfi-Tony confrontation. Great scene, totally believable. Jim_at_SF_Gate: funny, I had the same feeling about Paulie, as well. He seems perfectly within his element as the boys are going to the mattresses . . . Posted By: spearchamp | June 04 2007 at 01:36 PM Long time reader... first time poster... Maybe someone more insightful than I can make this parallel make sense... But did anyone else read into Tony concerning himself with Agent Harris' anti-terrorism work, only to be snapped into reality by the information that NY was planning on hitting his crew (information that upset him enough that he actually discarded the sandwich he was eating... did you ever expect to see Tony Soprano upset enough to stop in the middle of eating something and throw it out?). Meanwhile, A.J. is holed up in his mansion watching Frontline Iraq specials and reading internet terrorism news when Tony has to snap him into the reality of the current situation to let go of his depression and be a man for the family. I feel like there's something to that. I never expected the terrorism storyline to really flesh out in the end, and I'm really thinking now that David Chase was just trying to draw a parallel here. There was even a brief shot of Tony staring at the terrorist news site on A.J.'s computer and shaking his head in disbelief. Posted By: wcm99 | June 04 2007 at 01:44 PM I agree with you and Jim_ about Paulie. I've been watching the whole shebang from the beginning (thank you netflix!) and just watched the episode in which Paulie approaches Carmine (Big Carmine?) at the wedding. Carmine has no idea who he is. Cut to Paulie facing himself (and what a face!) in the (pishadu) mirror. He realized then that he was with Tony, for good. Posted By: maenad | June 04 2007 at 01:45 PM I don't think Paulie is in cahoots with NY - he went down that road once and nearly got burned. What I DO believe is that Phil and Co. are shrewd enough to realize that if they achieve their goal of knocking out T, Sil, and Bobby, that would leave Paulie as the likely puppet leader - certainly no match for Phil. It was interesting, though, to watch how the two Families prepared for "war". Tony's decision was to basically "outsource" the work, and Bobby (for all the confidence that Tony showed in him) basically started a "sh*t rolls downhill" approach until it essentially wound up in Patsy Parisi's hands (Tony, meanwhile, went to get new tires for his wife's car). Phil, on the other hand, laid out his strategy concisely, and Butchie made it very clear as to who was to do what to whom and when. Great illustration of Phil's up-front declaration of the relative merits of the 2 Families. Posted By: spearchamp | June 04 2007 at 01:52 PM maenad, I guess we were thinking about the same point regarding Paulie . . . Posted By: spearchamp | June 04 2007 at 01:56 PM The dread in this episode was almost too much to take. Seeing Bert in his driveway, getting the morning paper, was unsettling; having Sil walk up was terrifying, until they exchanged greetings, and then seeing Sil sneak up behind Bert with the piano wire was like getting hit over the head. And that was just the opening scene! And at the end, watching Tony in bed with his big-ass gun, we got a view of him from outside through the window, and my blood ran cold. Posted By: dsgonzale6 | June 04 2007 at 01:58 PM My theory: Paulie as Judas hands Tony over to Phil for some big showdown moment. The show has been ephasizing Paulie Walnuts going "crackers" in recent episodes, which would make him just stupid enough to take as big a risk as betraying Tony. Paulie is also a classic narcissist and so in order to elevate himself within one family or another, he could very well deliver Tony unto Phil. Like Phil, Paulie is obsessed with old-school ways and so there could be a natural alliance struck there. It also seems suspicious to me that the hit overlooked Paulie in favor of Bacala, who was not nearly as senior. Something smells fishy there... Posted By: Carmela_lite | June 04 2007 at 02:03 PM great minds think alike! Posted By: maenad | June 04 2007 at 02:03 PM A few weeks ago, Tony viewed Paulie as something between annoying and expendable. Now, compared to the cast of characters left in the safe house, Paulie looks like a Jeopardy champion. I can see room for some irony here, as Tony's prior oncern over whether Paulie has ever "really been tested" plays out as follows: Tony sings to the FBI while Paulie dies standing his ground. Of course, in granting Paulie the "best of the worst" status in the remaining safe house crew, I'm assuming that Carlo's cell phone call from the safe house wasn't really driven by hunger for pizza .... Posted By: blackjack33 | June 04 2007 at 02:08 PM I think Sil is going to live. The doctor's "don't think he'll regain consciousness" but that's far from dead. An interesting point is that Tony's crew doesn't need to be threatening, they just need to pull some triggers. Says a lot about who criminals are. They aren't these grandiose men of action, they are fat slackers who couldn't do anything else with their lives. I love Phil blaming New Jersey on a lack of tradition. Classic argument from old guys, blaming some trivial artifact from the good ole days for why things aren't as good as they used to be. "You know what the problem is these days? These kids got no respect..." Posted By: rhys1882 | June 04 2007 at 02:09 PM Brutal episode. Truley a trainwreck of an episode. I particularly liked the hit on the wrong people. In that 5 minutes, we had gratuitous violence, vut right to hardcore porn. So many balances in this episode, and I couldnt breathe when Tony was telling AJ to get the f*** out of the house. I was expecting NY to roll up any second. Posted By: imageburn13 | June 04 2007 at 02:10 PM In the end, Butchie gets it. Paulie gets it. Phil gets it. And yes, Tony has to get it. Hey ... Seriously, Carmela has to pay some sort of price in the end for her superficial, mob money-fueled, double-standard existence. You can't have it both ways, hon, and you've escaped for seven years. You don't even know Ade's dead! Think of all the wives in this show who ultimately paid the price in some way for being ``married to the mob'' -- Rosalie Aprile, Angie Bompansero, Ginny Sacremoni, Vito's wife, Christopher's wife, now Sil's wife and even Janice, who I almost felt sorry for when the family came to console her in the old Sack estate. All survived, but their flimsy mob-financed lifestyles were ruined. Has to happen to Carmela ... has to. Can't wait to see her fate, maybe more so than Tony's, which is pretty well cast. Agreed it was good to see Artie again. Even the minor characters in this show will be missed. Speaking of which, where's Benny? Did I miss a whack somewhere? Posted By: tarastew | June 04 2007 at 02:10 PM , great point re: Melfi's & the audience's feelings on Tony. Posted By: TimSPC | June 04 2007 at 02:11 PM First time comment. Love your work, Tim. Was going to say the same stuff about Paulie but the previous posts said it all. There's one wild card here: the Feds. With an informant (and if I'm right, a wire) in Phil's presence ordering the hit on Bacala, Sil and Tony, and with Bobby and Sil then hit, the Feds now have enough evidence to arrest the whole NY gang on conspiracy charges. On top of that, they owe Tony something but owe Phil nothing. Final result could be that Tony, who wants nothing more than finding a way out of this life, in charge of not only Jersey, but Phil's family also. Talk about irony. I really don't believe a word of this, by the way, but what the hell, it's speculation. Posted By: cerritoguy | June 04 2007 at 02:16 PM Does anyone know, is the last episode 1.5 hrs (ala Wire)? Posted By: sdv30 | June 04 2007 at 02:17 PM The Doors' "When The Music's Over" as stripper music in the first Bing floor scene. Nice choice, especially since that wouldn't have been strip-club music even when it was new.

Steven Spielberg's reality show on Fox about wannabe movie directors is a flop and a bore. Fox's "So You Think You Can Dance" and NBC's upcoming "America's Got Talent" are bad "American Idol" rip-offs. And did anyone catch that train wreck last week on CBS about pretend pirates searching for hidden treasure? Aaaargh indeed. The stop-action animals of "Creature Comforts" share their Aardman Animations pedigree with Wallace and Gromit. Tune in to the shows coming to airwaves this summer with our premiere calendar. Save & Share Article But take heart, channel surfers. The first bright spot of the hot months arrives tonight, and we've got a bunch of animated animals to thank for it. Created by the British company responsible for the popular "Wallace & Gromit" movies, "Creature Comforts," an animated half-hour comedy debuting tonight at 8 on CBS, is clever and often hilarious. The premise? The show's producers record the voices of "real people" throughout the country as they talk about everyday topics such as doctor visits, keeping secrets and the attraction between the sexes. These voices are bestowed upon various animal characters who all bear that familiar Claymationed "Wallace & Gromit" look. "Creature Comforts" opens tonight on a slightly crude note, but it's hard not to laugh. The voices of two men, apparently recorded at a wine tasting, are given to a pair of dogs sniffing a third dog where dogs generally sniff each other. "It smells pretty ripe," the dog says earnestly. "I'm getting medium to dark notes. Also, kind of a dry fruit character to it." Some of the must-see "Creature" characters include: two lovebirds sitting in their cage, where the wife lists her various ailments while her put-upon husband sits by; two porcupines discussing their fear of needles; a hippopotamus who hates being weighed by nurses, all of whom are skinny; and a pair of frisky bunnies discussing their love lives. The humor in the show derives from how perfectly the animal characters (dogs seem to be a specialty) and their expressions match the voices that are provided. In general, the jokes don't stray from PG-rated territory, save for a randy toucan who claims he's a "bisexual" -- "I like to ," he explains with a cackle. One 5-year-old viewer, who clearly didn't get any of the humor of the show, was still howling at the various animals that popped up onscreen. The biggest laugh for him was a water-fearing polar bear wearing floaties on his legs. (30 minutes) premieres tonight at 8 on WUSA (Channel 9).

Showtimes By City or Zip Code: Shop for TV on DVD INTERVIEW: Ronald D. Moore and David Eick Talk Monday, June 4th, 2007 The show's Executive Producers discuss why they chose to end things after the Fourth Season for the 21st century, Executive Producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick created a show that, while based on an older property, managed to be more topical than almost any other show on TV. Having already had three seasons with fans and critics alike both clamoring for more, Eick and Moore recently sat down to discuss the Fourth Season and final season of this show. Having spoken with Mark Stearn recently it didn't seem like the Fourth Season of was going to be last one. Where do you think the disconnect happened? I just think he's generally a shifty character. No, this is a decision that took some time to arrive at and like all decisions this large there are questions we had about it internally; a creative agenda that we wanted to serve, and I think we all had to collectively decide when it was time to be definitive about it and that time is now. I still don't blame him for keeping it close to vest until every side of this equation had been looked at. I understand that the first episode of Season Four is going to be a two hour prequel? Well, the two episodes are not really part of the Fourth Season. They're not connected to the cliffhanger where we ended Season Three. Essentially, the history was we were approached by home video in between the seasons, who expressed an interest in releasing a couple of the episodes on DVD for domestic and foreign distribution. As we talked about them internally, we realized there was no way we could really pick up the cliffhanger in that form. We preserved that for the official beginning of the Fourth Season. The way it made the most sense to all of us was to go back a little bit in time, not before the series began, but sort of back a season or two ago, say, the Second Season, and tell a story then. We found a way to connect the events of that story to things that will happen in the Fourth Season. So it sort of sets up some things that will happen in Season Four. This will air also? It will air on Sci Fi Channel, I don't have a date for you but the plan, as I understand it, is to air the episodes on Sci Fi and then it would be released on DVD either the next day or two days later. But before Season 4 starts? Yes, the extended episodes as we're calling them will be broadcast in the fall and the official start of Season Four will begin in early 2008. Since this show is so highly rated was there any pressure from Sci Fi of having it stay on the air longer? There was discussion of how long it should go on. To their credit they were very sensitive to what we wanted to do creatively on the show. Since it came from David and I approaching them and saying, "Look, we feel the show has reached its third act... it's about the resolution of the series and we feel the storyline is propelling us toward a conclusion..." They asked us questions about why we felt that way and they understood reasons and they wanted us to think about it for awhile, make sure it was what we wanted to do. They didn't really fight us on it. They expressed concern that the show might be able to go on longer and we wanted to make sure we weren't passing up opportunities to continue telling stories through the series. They were very accommodating. When David and I were very clear that this is what we wanted to do they supported us. Do you plan to wrap it up in an open-ended way in the Fourth Season? Maybe leave the door open for a feature film? Well, the plan is to end the show. The plan is to bring us to a definitive conclusion. There's no plans or even thoughts in our heads really of then doing a follow up feature, a mini-series or anything beyond that. It's also the kind of thing where you never say never. Who knows how we'll feel when we actually write the conclusion? Will there be a plotline or a story that springs to mind? Something that we create on the page that opens a door? It'd be foolish to say absolutely not. Right now the plan is for a definitive end. David, can you talk about your next project Well, I'm trying to make use of this cast as much as I can because I just have found, in the last year, we sort of stumbled upon the greatest collection of actors I've ever been a part of. Katee Sackhoff is someone who was in the pilot for ends, and even when we go on our hiatus, she's free and we may be able to use her in an episode or two of . Tricia Helfer was in another pilot I did for Fox called , which may be flirting with a midseason order. Sort of the same thing there if she was available... Also the directors from , once the opportunity developed to use one of them. Its been a great growth and evolution creatively, for everybody, to come out the end of this show and feel like, "Wow, we've got directors and actors and writers and all sorts of very talented and creative people, that we'll always stay in touch with and always work with because once you find those people you don't let them go." You talked about this show having a real definite end from the beginning. Do you think that was more freeing creatively or restricting? It felt very freeing. It felt like we had a definitive direction. There was a premise. This was a search for, this rag tag fleet was searching for the remainders of humanity and pursued by the Cylons. It was like, that's the path so it became a question of what you do along the way? The show just had a strong point of view and a definitive direction. I think that's very helpful. standalone episodes will air this fall. Season Four will commence in early 2008 on the Sci Fi Channel.

So both no doubt breathed a sigh of relief when they arrived on the red carpet for a Hollywood awards ceremony. A quick glance from each confirmed that, while the former Spice Girl had opted for a zebra-print frock, the movie star was in an all-black mini dress with black spots. Then they looked down - and their smiling faces turned to thunder. Scroll down for more Posh came to grips with her new Hollywood friend Cameron Diaz during her first high profile appearance in America Snap! The stars chat about their matching shoes Both women had gone for exactly the same shoes - shiny silver high heels costing £350 with the unmistakable Christian Louboutin signature, the red undersole. Miss Diaz, 34, looked distinctly unimpressed by the coincidence as the couple chatted backstage at the MTV Movie Awards. But 33-year-old Mrs Beckham carried on regardless, tottering on stage beside the actor, Chris Tucker, and receiving a surprisingly warm welcome from the live studio audience. Scroll down for more On the prowl: Posh worked her thigh baring zebra dress while on the red carpet In the five months since her husband David announced his £128 million move from Real Madrid to the LA Galaxy football club, the mother of three has been waiting patiently for her big break. While cynics are still questioning her ability to become a bona fide star in America, her appointment as a guest presenter at the awards was a step in the right direction since it placed her among such A-list company as Miss Diaz, John Travolta, Robin Williams and Samuel L. Jackson. Scroll down for more... Victoria Beckham presented an award with actor Chris Tucker, while Johnny Depp was the night's big winner Jack Nicholson, Sacha Baron Cohen and troubled socialite Paris Hilton were also all in attendance at the star-studded event. At the awards, it was Captain Jack Sparrow who was the big winner at the awards as Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest was named best movie and its star, Johnny Depp, won for best performance. Depp joined Pirates producer Jerry Bruckheimer to accept the Golden Popcorn trophy. Scroll down for more... Paris Hilton, hours before entering jail, put on a brave face while on the red carpet. Jessica Alba prepared for a Borat style 'high five!' Bruckheimer said: "This is the man who did it all right here, Johnny Depp. Without him, we wouldn't be here." "I'd like to thank this man and Disney for not firing me first," Depp quipped. Other big winners during the live broadcast from the Gibson Amphitheater included Mike Myers, who won the MTV Generation Award, and Sacha Baron Cohen, who collected two trophies. Scroll down for more... Justin Timberlake's current love interest Jessica Beil, and his ex Cameron Diaz managed to avoid an awkward encounter on the red carpet Cohen earned the comedic performance prize for his starring turn in Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. "Unfortunately, Borat can't be here tonight," he joked. "He's been feeling the pressures of fame and had to check himself into rehab." Cohen also claimed best-kiss honors for his smooch with Will Ferrell in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. Scroll down for more Amy Winehouse arrived with her husband Blake Fielder-Civil, while singer Rihanna turned heads in a plunging full-length gown The two comedians shared a long, passionate kiss - culminating in a roll-around-on-the-floor makeout session - as they accepted their awards. The movie prizes were almost upstaged by a star who wasn't nominated for any: Paris Hilton. The heiress, who has started her jail term just hours after appearing at the event, caused a commotion when she arrived on the ruby carpet outside the amphitheater. Wearing a ruffled black dress and dazzling jewels, she flashed her trademark coy smile as she posed for photos and talked with reporters. Scroll down for more Rihanna wowed the crowd with a performance of her hit Umbrella "I'm really scared but I'm ready to face my sentence," she said. "Even though this is a really hard time, I have my family, my friends and my fans to support me, and that's really helpful." Host Sarah Silverman cracked a crude joke at Hilton's expense to open the show. When the camera panned to Hilton, she was not smiling. Then the focus turned to films. MTV's irreverent mix of honors includes prizes for best fight and best villain, plus awards for aspiring filmmakers. Scroll down for more Amy Winehouse took to the stage to rock her chart topping hit Rehab Jack Nicholson was the winning villain, capturing the Golden Popcorn trophy for his mobster role in The Departed.

Speaking at a breakfast gathering at BookExpo America, the publishing industry's annual national convention, O'Donnell said her long-delayed memoir on fame will not be "vindictive" or "mean-spirited," but will offer a candid look at her very public life, including her brief, battling stint on "The View." A look at the famous faces making headlines in movies, music and more. Save & Share Article "It is, in fact, a drug," she said of fame, and spoke of seeing peers so radically, and scarily, transformed by celebrity that they looked like victims of "crystal meth." O'Donnell, looking healthy but tired on a Sunday morning, noted that her book was supposed to come out a few years ago, but she decided it wasn't ready, not quite "cooked." Her time on "The View" convinced her she was ready to start baking again. She called the book "half blog," half "straight" writing. Last month, O'Donnell ended an eight-month tenure on "The View" that lifted the show's ratings and, perhaps, the blood pressure of show creator Barbara Walters. O'Donnell feuded with Donald Trump and frequently had snippy exchanges with the more conservative Elisabeth Hasselbeck. "We've had to change the epilogue," she said of "Celebrity Detox," then joked that her next career move would be "auditioning for `The Apprentice.'"

Submit it to RT on Jun 04 2007, 05:48 AM Eh, the movie clips were acceptable; the interviews of course were junk. And evidently Michael Bay doesn't watch enough alien invasion movies... on Jun 04 2007, 06:58 AM I just viewed the clips and I am 100% believing in this movie. Michael Bay has made his best film and all his others have got nothing on Transformers. I can't wait!!! on Jun 04 2007, 07:14 AM I hope you're right. That's all I keep saying about this movie. I hope the believers are right. Me, I'm on the fence. Starscream still looks a little retarded. But who knows, maybe that's because he's moving too fast in the trailer and we haven't really gotten a chance to see him in profile on an actual film reel. Till then, I'm calling him Gorillascream. on Jun 04 2007, 07:27 AM I hope the believers are right too! I can't wait to love this movie! and if Bay tramples my dream of a good transformers movie I will never watch BadBoys 2 again!!!! oh wait I'm already not ever watching Badboys 2 again... on Jun 04 2007, 08:38 AM I don't know, Transformers worked mainly as a toy franchise and I can't stand most of Michael Bay's movies, so...I don't know. on Jun 04 2007, 08:56 AM some more good news I heard the test screenings for this movie scored the highest ever in cinematic history. on Jun 04 2007, 08:59 AM I hate copyright restrictions that prevent me from seeing the clips cause I'm outside the US. on Jun 04 2007, 09:39 AM Yeah, I heard about that too on www.totalbullshit.com. on Jun 04 2007, 09:42 AM I hope they're right too. It's looking good to me so far. Like the trailers and all I need during the summer is a good popcorn flick. I doubt Michael Bay will let me down in that regard. on Jun 04 2007, 10:06 AM this movie is going to be sick dont worry. everyone needs to stop hating on michael bay. people act like he's the worst director of all time. i still say he makes entertaining movies, maybe not classics, but certainly entertaining. i have more than enough faith in this movie and am very excited and i think everyone should be. plus you cant go wrong with my boy shia pimpin it with yet another hottie. shia's on fire with hot chicks lately. on Jun 04 2007, 12:25 PM Look closely at the desert scene!! Forgive me if I am wrong, but after watching the desert snipit, I believe that the robot being shown is scorponox, with his tail being what is trying to pierce the white guy. Let me know what you think. on Jun 04 2007, 12:26 PM Michael Bay or Uwe Boll, you choose. Me, I'm going with Bay. Transformers looks like good popcorn. I can imagine it being a pretty big movie. It has Die Hard and Ratatouille opening the week before it, and Harry Potter the week after. Transformers and HP will have quite the fight. Other than that, it's just smaller pics like Joshua, Sunshine and Hairspray for the rest of the month (no telling how big the Simpsons will be, but it comes out on July 27th anyways). We know that two movies (HP and Transformers) can be released close and still get +300 million since Shrek and Pirates will probably make it. Either way, they'll both be big. on Jun 04 2007, 12:35 PM Yeah, I can dig it. But this is one of those movies, man, where I gotta look at the hott girl and go, "so what?!". I live in Orlando, Florida. If I wanna see another goddamn vampy girl, all I gotta do is go outside. Give me a kickass Transformers movie! And yeah, Bay isn't anywhere near the worst director out there. And he was "born to make this movie," they say. But if they focus too much on that damn love story I'm so doing the 'give me a refund' bit at the Box office when it's over. on Jun 04 2007, 12:38 PM Damn, Merlin. You got on me not long ago for being too rough. My turn, dude. Michael Bay ..compared to Uwe Boll? Way too far, bro. Way too far. on Jun 04 2007, 12:54 PM I just wish I could take my 7-year-old to it - but it doesn't look age-appropriate at all. I guess fanboys buy more tickets than parents. Oh well, Ratatouille will probably be a better movie anyway. on Jun 04 2007, 01:01 PM We're scared enough as it is for Transformers, Crenshaw. Be gentle. on Jun 04 2007, 01:36 PM transformers is probably going to make a load of cash, but i cant see it hanging around with the big guns of harry potter and pixar... on Jun 04 2007, 01:56 PM check this clip at you tube.

Jun 4, 2007, 0:07 GMT Jun 4th, 2007 - 16:25:39 Seems that 44% less than 30 would mean the audience was mostly OLD!

Jun 4th, 2007 - 18:42:46 Those percentages of audience only matter as they compare to the movie-going audience as a whole. If 65% of movie-goers are under 30, then 44% is low; but if 27% of movie-goers are under 30, then 44% is quite high. There's no perspective here. PS What does 'knocking down ducks' mean?

In a 2-1 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York ruled that the FCC went too far in issuing a 2006 indecency decision against Fox for separate incidents in 2002 and 2003 when singer Cher and celebrity Nicole Richie, respectively, both uttered the f-word on live television. From The Post's Print Edition All of Today's Business Articles Today's Business Front Image Markets News and Research Save & Share Article In 2004, the agency ruled that the broadcast use of the f-word almost always violates federal indecency statutes. Because the Fox incidents occurred before that ruling, the agency did not call for a fine against the network but did rule that the broadcasts were indecent. Fox appealed the FCC ruling to the 2nd Circuit, saying that the profanities were fleeting and that the FCC's new rule set a dangerous precedent for clamping down on free speech. Some First Amendment lawyers saw the Fox appeal as a possible test case to challenge the government's ability to patrol the public airwaves at all. Today the court sided with Fox, writing that the FCC's "new policy sanctioning 'fleeting expletives' is arbitrary and capricious." In a separate case, CBS Corp. is challenging the FCC's indecency ruling against the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, in which singer Janet Jackson's right breast was briefly exposed. That case is pending.

The bad news is, many don't. For instance, during May 10's broadcast of "The Office" (the one where they go on a beach retreat), about 51 percent of DVR owners skipped through the commercials, whether they were watching the show in real time or up to a week after. The numbers come from Nielson Media Research , which has just started tracking commercial viewership alongside the number of audience members for the actual show. If you measure just real-time viewing, a total of 249,000 people skipped the ads that aired during "The Office" (about a 6 percent drop-off from the show to the commercials). But when you look at the overall stats for the first week of May, almost 70 percent of DVR viewers (18 to 49) stay tuned during commercials, which, quite frankly, seems pretty good to me. I mean, I start a show 15 minutes late just so I can fast-forward through commercials. Guess I'm a little more anti-ad than the rest of the world. Like you, I am also surprised by these statistics. I hate commercials, but at the same time, I will stop and rewind on my TiVo if something catches my eye in a commercial. / 1000 max characters DVR Owners Still Tune into Ads Sony Lowers Cost of Entry to Blu-ray Goodness Sony's Stylish HD Radio Charge Multiple Gadgets at Once EMI and Warner's Online Music Video Plans Sony to Update Its DVDirect Recorder Meet Slickr, Venzero's Newest Media Player (Playr?)

Nets Talk TiVo Instead Subscribe to Advertising Age today! More from Ad Age: Sign up for E-mail Newsletters &raquo;Sign-up for FREE e-mails Share & Save ( Commercial Ratings? Nets Talk TiVo Instead Metric Makes Debut, but Sellers Force Negotiations Back to DVR Viewership NEW YORK (AdAge.com) -- Nielsen finally released its long-deliberated, much-anticipated commercial-ratings data last week , confirming in hard data what everyone instinctively knew: that around 5% to 10% fewer people watch the commercials than the shows in which they appear. But the TV networks didn't want to talk about viewers taking toilet breaks; they wanted to talk TiVo. The networks are pushing for the upfront to include DVR viewers, hoping to bank a figure at least on par with last year's upfront take, estimated between $8.75 billion and $9 billion. Even though Nielsen noted that most prime-time viewing still occurs live (97% of it, to be precise), the TV networks were determined to focus the conversation on people who record programs and watch them (and sometimes the ads in them) at a later date. Marketers and their media buyers, who were expecting to discuss how many viewers disappeared during ad breaks, instead found themselves back where they were during the last upfront -- debating the value of live viewers vs. the DVR crowd. In exchange for letting Madison Avenue have its commercial ratings -- and therefore negotiate on the basis of a smaller audience -- networks are trying to bake in some way to regain the other audience they're losing, the time shifters. They are insisting they get paid for that sliver of DVR-enabled viewers who stick around to watch the ads as well as the programs after they originally air. That will stick in the craw of many advertisers, which "really see the biggest value in those ratings that are live or close to live," said Bill Duggan, exec VP, Association of National Advertisers. "It's just such a short-term business environment these days." Until now, marketers have paid TV networks for ad time based on the popularity of shows, not viewership of the commercials themselves. Commercial ratings are a step toward changing that, allowing prices to be set by viewership of ad breaks. While the new Nielsen ratings don't track individual ads or specific time slots, they offer average viewership of all the national commercial minutes in a program. And that could be the metric upon which this year's upfront deals are struck. But the networks are pushing for it to include DVR viewers, hoping to bank a figure at least on par with last year's upfront take, estimated between $8.75 billion and $9 billion. Buyers and sellers seem to be settling on "live plus three," allowing the ratings to include viewers who watch as many as three days later. "It gives the media credit for the way in which people are and will increasingly watch TV, and that's in some sort of time-shifted mode," said Alan Wurtzel, president-research and media development for NBC Universal. Keeping viewers in seats The problem is that most DVR viewers zap past the ads. Those who do watch them may see them long past their expiration dates. According to Nielsen, about 17% of U.S households have DVRs, and viewers 18 to 49 watch 10% of all broadcast-network prime-time programming via DVR. Network executives estimate more than half of those viewers skip the ads altogether. Even though Nielsen data shows that audiences grow the longer the viewing window, viewership of commercials lags significantly behind viewership of programs. This brings up issues for advertisers. A number of big-spending categories need to reach consumers at a specific day and time. Package-goods marketers, for instance, often use TV ads to push products being promoted with coupons. If an ad tells people to "pick it up in this Sunday's paper," and the ad is viewed after Sunday, "that message has now been devalued," said Scott Haugenes, senior VP-group director, national broadcast, Initiative. Fast-food marketers often have tie-ins to short-lived promotions -- offers for particular sandwiches or film openings. Retailers are known for advertising sales taking place in a few days. For movie studios, advertising on network TV on Thursday night has long been a dependable way to drive audiences into theaters for Friday film openings. "For the studios, the commercial message is timely. It has to be day-specific," said Jeff Robinson, senior VP-national television, Palisades Media Group, which handles buying for a number of movie studios. While DVRs don't account for the majority of viewers today, "there will be more every single day," said Ed Gold, director-corporate advertising for State Farm Insurance. "We are very concerned about utilizing any playback numbers until it's proven to us that people actually watch the commercials during playback." Nielsen's data is supposed to be compiled via set-top monitors that note whether viewers change the channel during an ad break or zap through ads with a DVR. For advertisers more focused on developing image and building awareness, people who see their ads days after they air are just as welcome as those who see them live. "We are in agreement that 'live plus three' data is the appropriate metric since most time-shifted viewing occurs within that time frame and the majority of our campaigns are not day and date sensitive," said Jon Stimmel, director-media buying, Unilever USA. "DVR playback of programming is only going to increase, so altering the economic model now is imperative." Even with commercial ratings in hand, this year's upfront is expected to continue at a glacial pace, media buyers said. Once completed in a matter of days, the annual ad-sales bazaar is taking weeks as a dizzying array of new media gives big networks more competition for ad dollars. Ultimately, commercial-ratings data doesn't solve Madison Avenue's need to demonstrate to senior corporate executives that advertising helps increase sales and brand awareness. Adding DVR viewers ito the mix may muddy the waters, and both sides now must be sure those viewers are really worth the extra money. "We want to pay for what we get. What we get is someone watching a 15- or 30-second spot," said State Farm's Mr. Gold.

Its foreign total stands at $408.8 million. Worldwide, including North America, "At World's End" has grossed $625.3 million to date. "At World's End" is the 24th film in industry history to have grossed more than $400 million overseas, and the fifth Disney title to pass that milestone. The latest in the "Pirates" film already has grossed 16% more than the final international total ($350 million) of 2003's "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl" and 60% of the final overseas gross ($642 million) accumulated by last year's "Dead Man's Chest." The weekend's only new market was India, where "At World's End" made off with an estimated $1.4 million, 50% more than the combined opening gross in the market of the first two "Pirates" titles. It was the market's third-biggest opening ever, Disney said. "At World's End" was No. 1 with mighty market share everywhere. In Japan, it earned $11.5 million (off just 4%), for a market total of $35.5 million. In the U.K., the weekend tally also was $11.5 million (down 49%), for a total of $57 million. Meanwhile, "Spider-Man 3" registered a weekend estimate of $11.8 million from 77 territories, lifting its overseas total to $525.7 million. Sony said it now ranks as the 12th-biggest overseas box office hit in industry history, one notch behind last year's "The Da Vinci Code," which grossed $539.7 million. Worldwide, "Spider-Man 3" has earned $844 million in five weeks. "Zodiac" performed well despite the tentpole onslaught, grossing $5.8 million from 38 territories.

'Sopranos' prepares to go out with a bang Posted: Monday, June 04, 2007 11:39 AM by Gael Fashingbauer Cooper Warning: Stop reading now if you haven't seen last night's "Sopranos" episode, or if you don't want to hear any speculation and possible spoilers about what the finale may bring. a stunner, or what? Tony's crew has been slowly being picked off for weeks now, with Tony himself helping matters along by dispatching Christofuh. I was sorry to see Bobby, perhaps the nicest, mellowest mobster in the crew, make his exit, and in such a bloody way, in such a calm location -- a model-train store. If anyone watching this show had needed a reminder that this is an adult program with heartless criminals at its core, there was the reminder, as a dad and his two small sons cowered and cried and Bobby was blown to bits, all while a model train crashed for emphasis. (If one of the Baccalas had to go, why couldn't it be whiny Janice?) Bobby's no angel -- when ordered by Tony in the season premiere, he iced a Canadian in a laundromat for no other reason than the guy was involved in a messy custody battle and his relatives wanted him out of the way. But in this crew, he was the softie, and sometimes the conscience, and seeing him killed was tough. Bobby wasn't the only one to find himself in the sights of Phil's New York crew. Silvio Dante, who's been Tony's workhorse for years, found himself attacked close to home -- in a car outside of Tony's own Bada Bing strip club. It was as if Phil's guys were making it clear: We can get you anywhere, you're not safe even on your own turf. Sil was shot repeatedly while topless dancers and others shrieked in horror, but as Paulie later related, he's one tough guy -- Sil is apparently not yet dead, but he's unlikely to regain consciousness. (We've got a on whether you think he'll make it or not.) Sil has had a long history with the Soprano crew. Many of the commentors on my earlier post believe he had sold Tony out and was working with the Feds (some also believe he had not actually killed Adriana, and was hiding her somewhere, which...wishful thinking, to my mind.) Sil has long been the one Tony turned to to take out traitors on his own side -- it's gotten to the point where if you see Silvio and you've been babbling to the other side, you'd better start running. In business negotiations he seemed the calm, silent type -- worlds away from garrulous Paulie Walnuts and even hotheaded Christopher. But he was perhaps more deadly than either of them, and to take him out of Tony's crew is a near-fatal blow. With just one episode to go, Tony's life has been devastated. Carmela, A.J. and Meadow have had to flee their luxurious McMansion. Tony himself has gone to the mattresses, managing to fall asleep, weapon in hand. (Do you really let your men order pizza when you're hiding out? I mean, I guess Domino's isn't on Phil's payroll, but that seemed a little unsafe to me.) And before this all started, even his longtime therapist, Dr. Melfi, dumped him as a patient. It's all rolling downhill for the big guy, and viewers are left to speculate if the series finale will continue that roll, or correct it in some way. My prediction is that things will only get worse for Tony. He may not die, but he will wish he had. That may mean jail, but I suspect it will instead mean a loss far greater than even the loss of Bobby and Sil. I predict something will happen in his blood family, whether Carmela, Meadow or A.J. are put in danger, or this latest happening will make his always-loyal family turn on him. I'm still holding out that it will be the revelation of the details of Adriana's murder that set things in motion, but I'm willing to accept that that storyline, as well as so many other unfinished plots (the Pine Barrens escapee, Melfi's rapist paying for his crime) will never be revisited. At least not unless David Chase takes the show to the movies. Share your thoughts about the most recent episode, and your predictions for the finale, in the comments. I think Phil will get whacked, but ultimately Tony will end up in jail, from the EPA, and the dumptruck load of Asbestos that was dumped near homes. S. Kidd, Seattle, WA (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 3:49 PM) I think Paulie is against Tony, he has been disappoint in the family from the beginning. Honestly, Paulie has been playing both side with New York going back to his relationship with John when he told that they made fun of Jenny's weight. Sil made a comment about how the New York crew were trying to recruit several people into new management..He just decided against it...That doesn't mean Paulie was so hard to convince. I think Tony will go into hiding/witness protection program...Remember from season 4 or 5 with his lawyer holding his money..Tony is rich. Carmela is rich individually.. I think they will keep Tony alive to have a spin off in a couple year.... I LOVE THIS FREAKIN' SHOW..MADA (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 3:50 PM) Tony will wake from a dream, where he is actually a mild manored accountant living in a cold water flat. Mike, New Hope, Pa. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 3:52 PM) Phil and Butch are wacked. Carmella leaves Tony after being frightened to death. AJ takes his own life. Meadow gets killed while hanging out with her connected boyfriend. Tony lives a loney pathetic life like Godfather II, but worse, he will have his only friend Paulie talking to him to death. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 3:53 PM) I think that Tony and Paulie are going to make it. Someone in Tony's family will die, possibly Meadow, since keeping AJ alive allows the family to continue under AJ. Either Paulie or AJ will get so mad that Meadow is killed that either one of them will kill Phil. But seasons ago, Tony had this dream vision of him and Paulie sitting in a high celing room at a table in the "Big House" with prison garb on. so there is a possibility that Tony and Paulie will go to jail, and AJ will then pick up the pieces and run the family. Sort of like what Michael did in The Godfather. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:04 PM) It will be a dream with Tony waking up and being on the show Dallas. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:04 PM) Phil will be in Hiding with the Feds and pauley will take over his spot (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:05 PM) Unbelievable episode. I watched this episode particularly closely as my Uncle was an extra in this episode...very cool. Here's my take. I agree that things will only get worse for Tony. I think the rest of his guys get wacked and Tony calls his FBI "friend" who he's spoken with in the deli in the past and goes into the witness protection program with is family turning states evidence implicating Phil. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:06 PM) Tony will be shot in his backyard and before he dies he will see the ducks in his pool again. Joey BagoDonuts, Levittown, Pa. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:06 PM) I think Tony will be approached by the FBI and take the family into the witness protection program, leaving wide open a future for the Sopranos. KC .ft, Myers, FL (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:07 PM) I believe that something tragic will happen to A.J. or Meadow, possibly one of them being caught in the crossfire and killed. (remember Godfather 3?). Tony will then be so devastated that he goes to the Feds, and goes into the witness program. Then he calls Dr. Melfi, with the last scene being him and her starting therapy, again. L. Leonard, Portland, MI (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:07 PM) I think Phil will kill Tony and AJ will step up and avenge his death and kill Phil and a few others. Or maybe he will go to the FBI for protection of his family. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:07 PM) I think the entire Soprano family will get whacked. The only one that will survive will be AJ. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:08 PM) I've been contemplating my version of an appropriate ending for so long, I'm at the point where I cannot imagine any other last episode except the one I've concocted! For so many reasons, but the most obvious being that Tony deserves the ultimate punishment for perpetuating this life of crime, with such wicked, ruthless disregard for human life. In my mind, I feel the only retribution powerful and ghastly enough would be the murder of Carm, AJ and Mead. I picture them all in one place together, with Phil thinking it's TONY who is actually in that location (though at this point, Phil has proved himself to be such a wretched, loathsome individual, that it probably wouldn't matter to him at all if the family members were at the end of the barrel or not)and setting up an explosion, or fire, or a mad rush. Why this way? Well, jail would not torture him to the degree I think is befitting. Murder is clearly is too easy. If Chase chooses this, I will just throw up my hands. No, I think Tony needs to be made to suffer the most unforgettable, gut wrenching tragedy that could ever befall a man. And since Pie-o-my (sp?)is long gone, seems the next most beloved thing left is his family unit of 3. Kristen , LA, CA (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:11 PM) I have a hunch Paulie's been talking to the NY crew. He always looks suspicious and last night was no different. Plus Walnuts is always looking out for number one and probably is still pissed at Tony for giving Christofuh one of his big money jobs. Tony, watch your back! (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:15 PM) One of his family must die. It will probably be Meadow driving in the city and the NY crew will mistake the car for Tony's. Everyone's life has been destroyed that has come into contact with Tony, and the only way to complete that is to destroy his immediate family. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:15 PM) The idea of Carm, Meadow & AJ turning on Tony never occurred to me. Now I have something else to think about. I don't think Tony will be killed and I think Sil will survive. After all, Christopher survived his shooting, Tony survived his... Plus, when you get right down to it, how can there be a Sopranos Movie without Tony & Sil? I can see a movie without Paulie, without Bobby, even without Carmella or one of the kids... but not without Tony & Sil. Just my two cents worth... (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:15 PM) either tony gets wacked and paulie takes over because he was on phils side all the time or tony goes with the feds and hides (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:16 PM) Any chance the woman mobster and Silvio will return from Italy and proect their US interests by saving Tony's crew? Sue, Kansas city, MO (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:16 PM) I think one of two things happens: 1) Tony somehow has Phil and his top guys wacked and installs Little Carmine as the new boss in NY. The show would end with Tony on top, being the de facto head of both NY and NJ. 2) Paulie betrays Tony and kills him. Paulie is installed as the head of NJ but is merely a figurehead for Phil as NY takes over NJ. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:16 PM) I predict that Sil will miraculously survive and that Carmela, not Tony, will be killed. Tony said it all when he said, "family never gets touched". Hmmmm.... They have to leave open the possibilty for a movie, so to kill off the main character would be stupid. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:17 PM) My original prediction at the start of this "part 2" of season 6 was that at least one soprano thug and one innocent (Carm, Meadow, or A.J.) would be killed. Now that Bobby is dead and Sil is likely on his way out, WOW, that makes for 2 thugs and I still kinda feel like one of the innocents will die next Sunday. I was thinking before-hand that yesturday's 2nd to last episode would account for at least 50% of the finale's shockers and/or deaths. After watching, that seems to be the case, to prove that wrong, next sunday is gonna have to be a violent and dramatic show. I see one more Soprano thug dying (which could be Tony) And still one innocent. In addition, There will probably be some other sort of shocker, i.e. A.J. killing Phil and perhaps Sunday's official finale will end with Tony getting arrested and indicted after killing off Phil and his thugs and winning the battle that we left of with at the end the show last night. I can't friggin wait!! (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:19 PM) Paulie Walnuts has always wanted to be a boss. I think he's gonna make a deal with Phil. Paulie will whack Tony and his family. Then take over the business. But he'll go to the hospital to finish off Sil. Sil will blow him away but die in the closing scene. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:19 PM) Crime doesn't pay. In real life the mob has just about ceased to exist. They no longer control waste management in NYC & Jersy. In the end Tony will regret being a mobster, maybe with his son or family damaged a lot, but probably not in prison. Randall Oklahoma City, OK (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:20 PM) One of the other 5 "Family's" will take out Phil, Butch and the rest of the one's who are hunting before they get to Tony. Carmine Jr. will then again serve the post his father held. Tony will continue to be on the run from the Feds, which he esentailly has been since the start of this wonderful series began. More loose ends will occur and the series ends with Tony pondering his life in an Ice Cream Soda Shoppe which he frequented in his childhood. Jim H. ( Woodcliff Lake, NJ) (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:21 PM) I'll start by saying that Tony needs Chris more than ever, and Bobby wouldn't have been the third target, it would have been Chris. Christopher personally was weak in some ways, but in business was the toughest guy in Tony's crew. As for the ending, there's only one. A war between one of the five NY Families against New Jersey will bring more of NY against the Soprano family. The only logical conclusion to the Soprano family taking down a Brooklyn Boss is when Little Carmine steps up and in, takes the Brooklyn family, and settles any problems other families may have with Jersey. As for Frank Vincent, and excellent bad guy, I hope they hang him from a rope off the Brooklyn Bridge and Butchie, his little worm of an advisor, I'd like to see the tears flow before the trigger is pulled on him. In the end, peace will come as Little Carmine and Tony Soprano form a solid business and personal alliance. Phil , New York, NY (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:22 PM) WoW, last nights show took my breath away, and then I felt sad. My husband and I have watched the show from the begining. We will miss all actors that were on the show. I really missed Christopher, when Tony wacked him, and now this. Poor Bobby, he was one of the nicest wise guys. Well in my ending I have AJ loosing it and shooting Tony ( even though he loves his father, he is bitter that he can't measure up and deepdown he can't stand violence ) Tony won't die. The beauty of this is, Tony will be parilised. ( he won't be able to talk or walk. His pennents will be that he spends the rest of his life in a wheel chair and it's his son that puts him there.) Last but not least I think it only fitting that Phil gets wacked by Janice. She can do it. The show will definately be missed. Good job to all of you, you played your parts well.

In the back of my head the way Tony looked at AJ's computer screen and saw about global terror I feel Tony might seek the FBI's help in some way to protect his family. No matter what I need to see Phil get his and I hope it's with Tony's hand. Rob D., San Diego, Ca. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:24 PM) Tony will loose everything, including his son. He will go to the Feds and work a deal as his only way of getting back at Phil. Fade out to nothing..... Ken Clark, Sarasota, FL (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:26 PM) I think Meadow will figure into the finale. In the last few episodes we've seen her ditch her med school plans, start dating a mobster's son, and emerge as the stronger of the 2 Soprano offspring. I'd love to see a flash forward at the very end, with Meadow running the Family, and supporting Carmella, who is still able to fool herself about the family she married into and her part in making it what it is. L Reynolds Denver, CO (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:28 PM) think Chase: Tony will not die (sequels). Phil will not die (prison). In real life bad guys win (Dick Cheney/Karl Rove). Maybe Carmine will kill him. Or there will be a peace meeting and Janice will kill Phil and Tony. AJ will run away, Meadow will move out and work for Gualliani, Camilla will go shopping. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:31 PM) I've been wondering if Furio will make an appearance in the last episode, finally taking Carm out of her hell?? (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:31 PM) I was absolutely stunned last night! My two favorite mobsters gunned down! I think it will end with Tony and Phil in a Mexican standoff. I think the earlier episodes showed Tony where each person close to him stood. Paulie, while a big mouth, will always protect Tony fiercly. And Christopher, well, I'm glad he's gone. But I'm at a lost and counting down the hours until Sunday. Olympia J., Columbia SC (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:31 PM) I believe that A.J. will kill his dad as some sort of vindication for his anti-violence trip. greg richoux, covington, la (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:35 PM) Tony will join the church and move to a cloistered monastary in northern Wisconsin. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:35 PM) Love, love, LOVE your blog! Sweet Bobby didn't deserve what happened last night...nor long life with Janice! Sil's loss is HUGE! He was strong enough to take care of things on his own...not having to wait for orders. Pauly wasn't targeted because he's weak. I've wondered about Adrianna's possibilities too...we'll see. I can't wait to see what happens next week. This isn't the kind of story that can have a happy ending, but I don't think Tony will be completely devastated (killed or jailed for life) but he may be hurt enough (Carm and/or the kids) to leave potential revenge storylines for the movie(s). (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:35 PM) I still don't think Tony will die, because that would, in effect, close the door on bringing the franchise to the big screen. Of course, by taking out Christopher, Bobby and, possibly, Silvio--three main characters--you've probably already lessened the value of the movie, anyway. I still think it's possible that A.J. dies next week, sending Tony over the edge and straight into an mental health facility. It's also entirely possible that the one guy Tony wasn't sure he could absolutely trust, Paulie, could be the one who ultimately saves Tony's rear-end by knocking off Phil. But, as the old phrase we goes, "We shall see..." (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:44 PM) I think Carmela will find out about Adriana's and Chris. Murders by Tony. So she might lose it and kill Tony. Or maybe even AJ will take him out. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:45 PM) Here is the deal...Paulie is the rat which is why a hit was not ordered on him. In the last episode Tony takes them all out including Paulie. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:45 PM) I believe the FBI agent that asked Tony for help identifying terrorists will figure in some way to save Tony, either by Tony's request or by accident. I don't think Tony will be killed. Maybe he will survive in some kind of Federal witness protection plan. J. Williams, Pelham, AL (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:45 PM) To kill Tony would be too easy and obvious way to finish the series. No way!!! Monica P Montclair NJ (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:46 PM) Tony will take it to Phil....some flunkie will spot Phil in some run down motel in Florida someplace. Then Paulie will step-up and "fix-it" in old time Luca Brasi fashion. Silvio recovers, Junior dies a natural death...but Carmela is still a b----, Meadow independent, and A.J., well....he's the same. Look to Janice to exact a little Soprano's revenge, too. Again, miraculously, Tony survives to fight another day. Thanks to Walnuts. Sal D, Utica, NY (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:49 PM) I think A.J. will come of age, accept his depression, get control of his wimpy life and become a new back up for Tony with the future of the Soprano family ultimately in his hands. AJ will assume his leadership role through "the law of the gun." Allan McIver, Leduc, Alberta, CANADA (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:49 PM) the fbi dude who told tony about the "hits", may allso let him (tony) know where phil is hiding. (maybe some kind of deal) tony and the jersey boys will kill phil and his top boys. the last scene will be tony sitting by the pool watching the ducks return. big bob, cottage hills, il. (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:51 PM) Losing all the big earners spells death for the NJ crime family, referred to by Phillie as nothing more than a "glorified crew." Vito, Sil, Christopher, Bobby...who are the supposed to be replaced with even if Tony does survive. For the people below Tony and Paulie its "meet the new boss, same as the old boss." (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:51 PM) Last nights episode was truly a stunner, but I guess with only two episodes left, they had to start chopping away at Tony's "family" in the next to last one. I can't help thinking, though, that the finale episode has been predicted by Dr. Melfi and her associates: that the sociopath only uses talk therapy to become more criminal. I think Tony, feeling trapped like a rat, will turn to the Feds to save his skin and his (real) family and will enter the witness protection program and thereby picking off Phil and his family one by one. However it ends, I am going to miss tuning in on The Sopranos... Mike Jenkins, New Port Richey, FL (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:54 PM) How come no one has mentioned a terrorist link? Tony helping out the FBI and then wondering what happened. Are all the little chats and discussions just to throw in one more possiblty of what can happen? I think one of the kids will get it and the other will start running the family, lets hope it's not AJ, don't count him out yet, may be this is all just a ploy to confuse us even more. Lots of loose ends to tie up in only an hour. Kerry, Las Vegas Nevada (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:54 PM) In sort of a demented and curious way...Absolutely the best show Television has to offer! (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 4:55 PM) Pauli will kill Tony. That's why he wasn't targeted by Phil. Alternately, Pauli is a government informant who has been taping Tony for the FBI. The only way Tony won't die is if he becomes a rat himself to save his family. Dan W, Oklahoma City OK (Sent Monday, June 04, 2007 5:00 PM) It would seem that there is an unlimited appetite for more episodes of the Sopranos and since that is not an option then the big screen and big bucks are next. With that said Tony, Phil and the rest of them will die (maybe Paulie survives) in a rain of bullets and the feature film portrays the beginning of the Sopranos with a young cast including Tony and the gang, Tony's mother and father, a young Junior and some of the others we've seen over the years.

Circuit judge will decide whether the multimillionaire head of a Chicago energy firm must give his ex-wife half of his fortune. Michael Polsky, 57, who heads Invenergy LLC, has been ordered to give Maya Polsky, 55, some $176 million in a divorce case viewed as remarkable and historic, the Chicago Tribune reported. Lawyers for Michael Polsky argue that he alone was responsible for building the couple's wealth after they emigrated from Russia in the 1970s. His wife, who stayed at home, contends she was her husband's trusted confidant and should be considered a full partner in his success. Her lawyers argue she should get more than half the wealth because Michael Polsky's future earning power is greater than hers. Boyd promised to rule this week on whether his division of the property last October would stand. In addition to valuable artwork, furniture and jewelry, the couple had five homes.

RSS feed for this blog Add to My Yahoo For Boston Globe television reviews, visit &laquo; But the Geeks are Only So Powerful Ex-wives and ex-cars &raquo; Monday, June 4, 2007 Before I make a few little points about last night's tense, mind-blowing, excellent episode of "The Sopranos," I have to warn readers that there are in this entry, and they are you will definitely want to avoid until after you've watched. My whole body was on edge during the show, which built quickly to full-on gang warfare after years of moving in that direction. "Ready for the rapture?" was the FBI agent's comment to Tony, and to us. As soon as I realized it was Phil and his evil-looking goons against the likes of Tony, Sil, Bobby, and Paulie, I knew the New Jersey guys were doomed. I loved the little bit of "Raging Bull" between Tony and Sil while they strategized in the restaurant; another nice passing homage to Martin Scorsese. Tony is now without his best ally, the comatose Silvio, who'd earlier in the episode made a malapropism about his wife being "terminally" ill. There was a brief moment during the shooting when Silvio was crawling in the car that reminded me of the way Adriana crawled before he shot her (an important reminder, since I tend to romanticize Sil's loyalty). And Bobby was nixed in a great shooting scene that built slowly and eerily at the train store, the center of Bobby's innocence. I loved it that kids were screaming; they were delivering the sounds Bobby, the eternal child, couldn't. The handling of Melfi's rejection of Tony was powerfully done, I thought. Her built-up contempt for him -- and for her own naivete -- was painful to watch. Elliot is a complete creep, and unethical, too, as he told Melfi's social circle about her client. Is he jealous of Melfi's encounters with a famous criminal? Dude's got issues. The entire series was framed by Tony's therapy sessions, and so I'm glad to see David Chase (who cowrote last night's episode) giving the therapy theme some importance in the end. I wouldn't be surprised to see Melfi back in some way next week, even as part of a coda. Without Melfi, Sil, Bobby, and Christopher, and with his family safely elsewhere, Tony is left alone in a bed with a gun in some mysterious safe house. I don't believe he will off himself, although the camerawork teased us with that possibility as he climbed onto the bed. I'm more of the mind right now that Paulie, so two-faced, will kill Tony, or at least try to, in hopes he'll survive with Phil. Or will Tony give up his life to save Carmela, or A.J., in one big act of self-sacrifice that will prove Elliot (and now Melfi) wrong? I'm not holding my breath... I can't wait for next week; and I'm dreading it, too. All good things must pass, I guess. Did you see the episode? Talk about it on "The Sopranos" message board.

The clearly peeved judge rejected the defense team's attempt to use the material to cross-examine Dr. Louis Pena, the coroner who concluded actress Lana Clarkson's Feb. 3, 2003, death at Spector's mansion was a homicide. Pena disputed defense insinuations it was a suicide. Music producer Phil Spector looks back toward the gallery during his murder trial at Los Angeles Superior Court, Thursday, May 31, 2007, in Los Angeles. Spector is accused of murder in the shooting death of actress Lana Clarkson in February 2003. (AP Photo/Robyn Beck, Pool) (Robyn Beck - AP) The MTV Movie Awards The Oscars it isn't: A look at images from this year's madcap MTV Movie Awards. Save & Share Article Spector's lawyers described the manuscript from Clarkson's computer as including accounts of her having visions of a dead actress who killed herself with a gun. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler had indicated Friday that he likely would allow the material. After reading the document during the weekend, he returned to court with a stern expression and said that what he found in the manuscript was so different than the defense characterizations that he checked to see if he had the right document. He read aloud the passage about the dead actress, which showed Clarkson had found the account in a book about the history of Hollywood. And rather than visions, there was a description of seeing shadows pass a window. "I don't consider anything in this particular document to be significant," Fidler concluded after allowing the defense to try to substantiate its claims. Fidler said he would consider allowing the defense to introduce the material when it calls its own experts, but not to cross-examine the coroner. Spector, 67, the producer who rose to fame with the hit-making "Wall of Sound" recording technique in the 1960s, is accused of murdering Clarkson, whose body was found slumped in a chair in the foyer of his mansion. Clarkson, who was 40, had met him for the first time at her job as a hostess in a VIP room at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip.

Christine Ebersole's triumphant odyssey Special to the Tribune She's the toast of Broadway right now; the odds-on favorite to win the best actress Tony award June 10 for the musical "Grey Gardens." And Christine Ebersole is savoring her moment, not so much for the nightly standing ovations or the sweet success that has come to a 54-year-old actress who has overpaid her dues, but because Ebersole nearly single-handedly propelled a tough-to-categorize show from off-Broadway onto the big stage and into the position to reap accolades. "I never doubted the show would succeed &#091;on Broadway&#093;," Ebersole says. "My belief in it was so strong, I knew we had to find some way to plug into those that believed and not try to convince those that didn't." Ebersole has just finished a Tony Awards rehearsal at Radio City Music Hall (she'll sing a number from "Grey Gardens" at the ceremony) and now, settling into her dressing room backstage at the Walter Kerr Theater, she's squeezing interviews, photo shoots and a much-needed nap into the precious hours before the curtain goes up at 8. Even some members of the creative team behind "Grey Gardens" -- Pulitzer prize-winning writer Doug Wright, lyricist Michael Korie and composer Scott Frankel -- weren't convinced the quirky musical based on the 1975 cult classic documentary had the "legs" for a an expensive Broadway run. After its debut at Playwrights Horizons off-Broadway, where the show earned mixed reviews (except for the performances by Ebersole and Mary Louise Wilson, which won raves), Ebersole campaigned to get it produced in a Broadway theater. "I had to just get everybody on board," she says. "I told them, 'don't listen to the noise. Don't listen to the statistics. We just have to believe in its worth.' When I got half a million dollars on the table, I called a meeting with Playwrights Horizons, and I told them, either we do what it takes to get this show to Broadway or I'm letting it go." Her pale blue eyes well up, in an overwhelmed, not overly dramatic way, as she talks of sitting in the theater as the Tony nominees were announced and "Grey Gardens" earned a whopping 10, including best musical. "Seeing all our names -- it blew me away because I believed in it. I've won already, just to get to this place, this moment of recognition. It is a testament of faith," she says. It wasn't always so for the Winnetka-born Ebsersole, who still has family in the Chicago area: a brother in Glen Ellyn and a sister in Ft. Sheridan. She attended MacMurray College in Jacksonville for two years before a theater professor told her to get to New York. At 20, she was waiting on tables in Manhattan; two years later, she got her first job -- on Broadway in the play "Angel Street" ("The producer had to buy my equity card," she says.) She continued to land roles that made good use of her trained voice, from co-starring with Richard Burton and Richard Harris in a revival of "Camelot" to matching wits with Kevin Kline in "On the Twentieth Century." Despite "the amazing family of show business" she had so easily fallen into, Ebersole decided to make the break for Los Angeles and cultivate her television and film career, one that began with her single, rather forgettable season (1981-82) as a regular cast member of "Saturday Night Live." Born for the stage Her big-screen resume is long and varied ("it's been a kaleidoscope kind of career") with the peaks ("Tootsie") and valleys ("Ghost Dad") of any journeyman actor. But Ebersole never really found her niche in L.A. Tall and fair -- in person she resembles actresses Joan Allen and Jessica Lange -- Ebersole's musical and dramatic skills perhaps couldn't be contained anywhere else but the stage. So, six years ago, Ebersole decided to return to New York (she lives in Maplewood, N.J., with her husband &#091;Bill Moloney&#093;, mother, three kids and many pets). The move agreed with her, and Ebersole found success back on Broadway, playing the hostess in "Dinner at Eight" ("I love that show; I wanted to do it forever") and winning the Tony in 2001 for the revival of "42nd Street." But in the dual role of Edith and Edie Bouvier Beale, the socialites turned recluses who spend their days indulging in music, memories and regrets, she found "the role of a lifetime." "It is the most demanding role I've ever done. Oh, God, yes," she says, running her hand over her face and through her hair. "I'm always on stage." Both roles require different but equally strong singing voices. By act two, in which Ebersole plays the more showy part of "Little" Edie, the first cousin of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, the show's intense themes of "devotion, loyalty, responsibility, non-conformity and freedom" is at full throttle. One would have to feel somewhat youthful to be the mother of three children under 10. "That's what keeps it real and keeps me sane," she says. "But it's a terrible sacrifice; that's the worst part of doing a Broadway show. I'm never home to tuck them in at night. They don't want to see &#091;"Grey Gardens"&#093;. It's what takes me away from them and they don't like it. Neither do I." Mothering adopted children is one thing she shares with friend Rosie O'Donnell; the other is a love of the Broadway stage. Rosie routinely talked up "Grey Gardens" and Ebersole's performance, along with many others, daily on "The View." "That's the worst part of her leaving &#091;"The View"&#093;. She was our one Broadway advocate," Ebersole says. "She was the only person on TV who talked about Broadway." At the Walter Kerr Theater, the well-wishers streaming backstage night after night include not just celebrities, but the visitors who remember Ebersole from grade school and high school. "They're people I haven't seen, literally, since I was 16," she says. "It's amazing and wonderful." Ebersole will attend the Tony Awards with her husband, and very likely tear up as the multiple nominations for "Grey Gardens" are announced. Regardless of who wins, it is her personal triumph, she says, "for being on my purpose, the purpose of work -- and the universe has responded in kind." Copyright & terms of service

Go to a Section: 5:12PM EDT, Mon 4 Jun 2007 "Battlestar" finale in works for a while Mon Jun 4, 2007 3:26PM EDT Talk of the Town: Hugh's relief Rejected by ABC, political satire sparks interest History's "Dogfights" flies online Kirstie Alley can't go "Wrong" in Lifetime movie 'Dr. Death' Kevorkian will no longer help end lives LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - The executive producers of Sci Fi Channel's "Battlestar Galactica," which will kick off its fourth and final season next year, said plans for the show's demise have been in the works for more than a year. Ronald D. Moore said he and David Eick started thinking about the show's end midway through the second season but that the idea really gained traction somewhere in the middle of Season 3, when the characters reached the algae planet and got a clue to finding Earth. "We thought, if we don't start paying this off and really revealing those secrets, we'll be moving in the wrong direction and get to a place where it felt like we were jerking off the audience," Moore said during a conference call with reporters Friday, a day after they announced the hit show would end. They said the network was supportive of their decision. "This is a decision that took some time to arrive at," Eick said. "There was a number of questions internally and a creative agenda we wanted to serve, and we all had to collectively decide when to be definitive about it, and that time is now." As for the cast's response to the news, Eick said it was mixed, with some expressing surprise and others who were more understanding. He added that the cast is approaching the fourth season differently knowing that it's their last. Moore and Eick were vague on their plans for the series' final episodes, but Moore did say that viewers will "get to see Earth" by the end of the show. He added that most story lines will be tied up in the finale but believed there was "value to leaving some things open to the imagination and unresolved." Moore also said there are no plans for a feature or miniseries beyond the finale, but he added, "Never say never." The producers also are talking to Lucy Lawless about reprising her "Battlestar" role as D'Anna Biers, but nothing is definite. &copy; Reuters 2007. All rights reserved.

"This show was always meant to have a beginning, a middle and, finally, an end," said 's executive producers Ronald D. Moore and David Eick in a prepared statement. "Over the course of the last year, the story and the characters have been moving strongly toward that end, and we've decided to listen to those internal voices and conclude the show on our own terms." is scheduled to launch this November with a special two-hour installment that will set the stage for next season as well as answer some lingering questions. Look for the series to then return in January 2008 with a batch of new episodes. I'm glad that Moore and Eick will get to wrap things up in a way that they see fit and were given the time and go-ahead from Sci Fi to do just that: break this season's stories as the final chapter in the saga. And 22 episodes (including that 2-hour "movie") seems like a perfect way to end this brilliant series with a bang. I'm just sad to see these characters go; I came to the party a little late in the game (during Season Two) and I can't help but feel that I will miss Starbuck, Lee, Roslin, Adama, and all the rest. Sigh. -related news, Sci Fi still has not made a decision about the fate of it's still-in-development Battlestar prequel ; while a script has been sitting on the shelf over at the cabler, no decision about its future has been made.

And there's her older sister, married with kids to a wealthy music agent. They're not exactly an inspiring role model: &#34;Everybody's all pissed off all the time.&#34; Observes one character, &#34;A marriage is like an unfunny, tense version of The effort to have a happy partnership is not only at the tender heart of this movie, it's also the subject of almost every self-help book that's not about losing weight. That's because much of life is about a yearning for contented coupledom, the strategy to find it, and the struggle to maintain it. And it's why, along with all the raunch in , there's also the sweet wistfulness of wanting to make relationships work. &#34;Think we'll ever be as happy as the Baby Bjorn couple?&#34; asks father-to-be Ben, catching sight of the image on the baby carrier box. Chances are they will. Because whereas most couples begin by mistaking chemistry and passion for authentic intimacy and knowing each other, Ben and Alison are merely sharing an embryo. Not blinded by love, they can coolly and rigorously scrutinize each other as potential partners: &#34;We have seven months until the baby comes ... seven months of getting to know each other.&#34; &#34;Falling in love, people idealize each other,&#34; says Toronto psychoanalyst and couples therapist Keith Haartman. &#34;It's a wonderful state to be in but can never sustain itself. They always have to confront each other's foibles and limitations.&#34; Ben and Alison do this with brio from the beginning. Generally in dating, &#34;you don't even look at each other through the spousal lens,&#34; says John Van Epp, author of How To Avoid Marrying A Jerk . The Ohio-based relationship counsellor believes &#34;has some embedded wisdom.&#34; He says it's wise that Alison &#34;doesn't move in or agree to marry Ben: forcing him to be independent is more revealing.&#34; He adds, &#34;It's wonderful to have a depiction of somebody getting better over the course of a relationship.&#34; People can change, he says, but &#34;you don't want to change them. You want to see if it's self-maintaining. Three to six months is a good rule of thumb.&#34; (Just as in a new relationship, &#34;Around three months you start to see things not evident in the first two months.&#34;) Ben and Alison are doing just what Guy Grenier prescribes in his book, The 10 Conversations You Must Have Before You Get Married &#34;Co-ordinating needs, wants, desires, likes and dislikes,&#34; he says, &#34;is five times more difficult than rocket science. Taking it for granted, thinking it just happens, is naÃ¯ve and dangerous.&#34; But figuring it out, says the London, Ont., psychologist and marital therapist, &#34;can be a lot of fun.&#34; &#34;The more similarities, the easier and the better, and the greater the likelihood you're not going to be in conflict,&#34; he explains. While one big difference in important areas such as family, money, sex, kids and religion won't be fatal, Grenier warns, &#34;10 will be.&#34; Healthy relationships, he says, deal well with three critically important issues: attachment, autonomy and equality: &#34;People need to feel the relationship is equally costly and equally benefiting.&#34; The three things couples fight about most? &#34;Chores, money, sex.&#34; But, suggests Haartman, &#34;In the vast majority of instances, what people are arguing about is not what they're arguing about.&#34; Very often, he says, couples repeat traumas of childhood and with previous partners in hopes of finding some resolution. &#34;Each partner may demand of the other that they right the wrongs of the past.&#34; Sometimes, however, it all comes down to determination to make it work, for any number of reasons. &#34;Would she have stuck with it if she hadn't been pregnant?&#34; Van Epp wonders about the movie. Apatow's response to the over-arching relationship question? &#34;There's something honourable about ... not breaking up for the sake of the baby,&#34; he told the . &#34;I see people get divorced and there is a part of me that thinks, `I wonder how hard they tried?'&#34; Horse, heiress and a hurdle Charities worthy of donations Great home delivery subscription deals here!

GILLESPIE SEATTLE -- Caffeine junkies who go to Starbucks for their daily fix will get a nonstop dose of Paul McCartney's "Memory Almost Full" on Tuesday as the coffee company's new record label releases its first CD. Starbucks Corp. estimates that some 6 million people will be among the first to hear the new album as they line up for their lattes in more than 10,000 stores in 29 countries, where it will be playing on continuous loop throughout the day. It's a tactic most retailers would not likely attempt "probably for no other reason than not wanting to drive their workers insane," quipped Mike McGuire, an analyst for Gartner Inc. Still, McGuire said Starbucks has proved to be adept at selling music and thinks it's smart for the company to tap into its vast customer base. "Let's face it. The energy has kind of gone out of the CD store launch," McGuire said, "so you've got to go where (consumers) are, which is typically buying coffee at a Starbucks." Ken Lombard, president of Starbucks' entertainment division, said he's not worried about customers or baristas succumbing to McCartney overload. "To the contrary, we think everybody's going to be really excited," he said. Starbucks co-founded its Hear Music label with Concord Music Group in March. McCartney was in the final stages of recording and mastering his latest set of songs when he signed a one-album deal with Hear Music, becoming the label's first artist. "Once we heard the album ... we just knew this was a phenomenal record," Lombard said. "It is the most personal and revealing album that Paul has created in his solo career. ... It's such a reflection of his life and his career, I mean, the ups and downs and the recognition of really what a remarkable journey it has been. So it was really for us the perfect fit." Lombard said he hasn't set any sales targets for "Memory Almost Full" but that he'd be "ecstatic" if it ends up rivaling "Genius Loves Company," an album of Ray Charles duets that Starbucks and Concord co-released in 2004. It won eight Grammy awards the following year and has sold more than 5.5 million copies worldwide. McCartney remains Hear Music's only artist, but Lombard said the label remains on track with previously announced plans to sign two more artists this year and eight next year. Executives remain hopeful that McCartney will sign on for future albums. "The relationship is going very well between us, and it is our hope that Paul is feeling the same way," Lombard said. "When the time is right, we'll talk about what the next steps are going to be beyond this, but right now our focus is doing everything we can to ensure that 'Memory Almost Full' is an extraordinary success." A spokesman for McCartney declined to comment. In addition to playing and selling the album in its stores, Starbucks got XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. to play McCartney music exclusively on one of its channels Tuesday, putting "Memory Almost Full" in heavy rotation. Hear Music has also hired crews in London, New York, Berlin, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Miami to film footage of McCartney fans wishing him happy birthday for a video tribute that will be broadcast on Internet social-networking sites, including Google Inc.'s YouTube, Yahoo Inc.'s Yahoo360 and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Live Spaces, on the artist's 65th birthday June 18. Most labels lean heavily on artist appearances for CD releases, but Lombard said Monday it was not yet clear exactly what McCartney would be doing the day of the release. "Paul likes to work in a way that he comes in and provides a great surprise to his fans and to music consumers, and that's an approach we're all on board with," Lombard said. Hear Music hasn't completely abandoned more traditional marketing methods, but is relying a lot less on advance radio play and music reviews ahead of "Memory Almost Full's" release. The album will be sold at most Starbucks stores worldwide, in all major music retailers, and on Apple Inc.'s iTunes online music store, making it the first of McCartney's 21 solo albums to be released digitally.

For the moment, Tony is still alive. But life has been falling apart for him all season, on many fronts, at an escalating rate. Losses he has suffered range from business income (as his crew's earnings plunge) to self-esteem (his depression has returned with a vengeance). He's been forced to watch as his aimless son, A.J., was hospitalized for depression, and as daughter Meadow ditched her plans to study medicine. He also lost his nephew Christopher, who he once imagined would take over the crew. (Tony took an active role in this development: Fed up with Christopher's disloyalty, he killed him a few episodes ago.) In sum, Tony has lost the one thing no mob boss (or ordinary family man) can afford to be without: control. Tony is flailing, as Sunday's episode demonstrated disturbingly. (Spoiler alert: If you plan to watch the episode later and don't want a casualty report, stop reading now.) With hostilities boiling between New Jersey capo Tony Soprano and the New York mob, Brooklyn boss Phil Leotardo ordered hits on Tony, consigliere Silvio Dante and top soldier Bobby Bacala (who is Tony's brother-in-law). After getting tipped to the execution order by an FBI agent, Tony declared, "We gotta hit first." Tony summoned two gunmen from Italy to take out Leotardo. But they shot the wrong gray-haired guy, an innocent victim. Meanwhile, the very much alive Leotardo (Frank Vincent) disappeared as his own people struck back. Bobby (Steven R. Schirripa) was shot down in a hobby shop, where the model-train buff was about to buy a new train for his layout. Then Sil (Steven Van Zandt) was critically wounded in the parking lot of the Bada Bing! strip club. Later, word came down that he wasn't expected to regain consciousness. (Patsy Parisi, at the wheel of the car in which Sil was a passenger, was apparently uninjured by the shooters and fled on foot.) Earlier in the hour, Tony's psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi, kicked out her longtime client after conceding, with dismay, that a recent study was right: Sociopaths don't improve from therapy, but use it to sharpen their antisocial skills by manipulating the therapist. "We're making progress," huffed Tony when Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) grimly announced she wouldn't be treating him anymore. "It's been seven years!" The episode ended with Tony sending his wife, Carmela, as well as Meadow and A.J., into hiding. "It's just a precaution," Tony insisted. Separated from them, he was last seen in a tiny bedroom of a strange house in the dead of night, cradling a huge weapon, with Paulie and others of his dwindling crew downstairs, on guard. Back at the Bada Bing!, the Doors song "When the Music's Over" had been playing. And even if the viewer didn't know that next week is this HBO series' final episode, the truth was obvious: For Tony and "The Sopranos," time is running out.

Posted Jun 4, 2007 1:44 pm PT , Legendary Pictures CEO Thomas Tull was shoring up $150 million in financing for a new independent video game studio, Brash Entertainment. Specializing in games "that will be licensed with major movie, book, and music titles," the fledgling company reportedly had six projects on its slate. It would appear those numbers were a bit off. Brash today announced that it has acquired $400 million in funding to bring to the interactive medium properties based on movies, television, and music. Funding for the developer comes by way of media-focused private investment firm Abry Partners. The recently formed studio reportedly has 12 projects in the pipe, with 40 licenses from five major film studios also in its portfolio. Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Group has signed as the company's worldwide distributor. Shirking the Activision/THQ model of big-business film-to-video game tie-ins, Brash will be collaborating solely with independent studios. As Brash cofounder Mitch Davis puts it, this is so the company can be "laser focused on creating high-quality games...the other aspects of our business are left to the experts--best-of-breed partners we've tapped for their specific expertise." There's been much speculation of a PC/console adaptation of , given that Tull's Legendary Pictures made the movie in the first place. In lieu of official word of the title's existence, is citing sources that confirm 300 is in development. No other details on the game emerged, but Brash brass have stated that the company will be developing for all major consoles, handhelds, and mobile devices. However, Brash did note that development had begun on Lionsgate's gross-out horror flick , as well as on upcoming children's animated films and "action-packed thrillers." &laquo; Back to Today's News to post a comment on this story!

Starcraft 2. Add to My AOL Get New Posts via Email June 04, 2007: 05:19 PM Nielsen tracks commerical viewing habits Posted Jun 4th 2007 12:45PM by That "bloop-bloop-bloop" you hear is the collective fast-forwarding over the commercials as households with ) or other digital video recording (DVR) devices zoom through the ad breaks. A recent article in the reports that with DVR use on the rise, the Nielsen ratings group has started to monitor how American television watchers Advertisers have been claiming of late that the increased use of DVRs cuts down on the actual viewing of commercials. With fewer eyes ostensibly on the advertising messages, many feel that the cost for air time should be reduced. This month, with May sweeps on the books, networks and advertisers begin work on contracts for the fall season, so these fresh Nielsen numbers may be used as a bargaining chip to calculate ad rates for prime-time space on the major networks. Last year, advertisers pledged $8.75 billion in commercial-spot dollars during the "upfront" sales season. Current expectations are for this figure to decline this year. A recent Nielsen survey showed that DVRs are in 17% of American households; the average commercial is seen by 40% of those viewers who play back shows on their DVR device. 40%? Is that really possible? Even when my husband and I are home when our favorite shows start, we typically wait a determined period of time (10 minutes for half-hour shows, 20 minutes for hour-long programs) before sitting down to begin watching. That way, we can skip all of the commercials -- except for ) "I'm a PC/I'm a Mac" spots, which just amuse me -- and still finish at the top (or bottom) of the hour. Between DVR technology, iTunes downloads, streaming video over the Internet, and the quick availability of DVDs, the television industry is changing at warp speed.

The best comedic performance award went to British actor Sacha Baron Cohen, for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan. Cohen also won the prize for best kiss for his lip action with Will Ferrell in Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. The two comedians accepted the award by giving a repeat performance on stage in the live broadcast, DPA reported. The Greek epic 300 led the nominations with five mentions, but only won the best fight award for its star, Scottish actor Gerard Butler. Jack Nicholson was named best villain for his role as a mobster in The Departed. Comedian Mike Myers won the MTV Generation Award for his life&#039;s work. The show was hosted by caustic comedienne Sarah Silverman, and featured appearances from the likes of Cameron Diaz, Victoria Beckham, Jessica Alba, Shia LaBeouf, Bruce Willis Jay-Z, Rihanna, Amy Winehouse and Jessica Biel.

McCartney's 'Memory' proves just a bit spotty By Joan Anderman, Globe Staff | Anyone mystified by the news that Paul McCartney has abandoned his longtime record company, EMI, and hitched his wagon to Hear Music label hasn't fully considered the marketing potential of this venture. For starters, tomorrow McCartney's new album will play all day in every Starbucks store in the world. That's some mighty cross-promotion, and it will almost certainly produce huge first-week sales. But it won't make "Memory Almost Full" a great album. This collection is filled with half-baked ideas and shallow reminiscences, a pair of dated rockers, and one meditation on mortality that manages to be maudlin and bubble-headed at the same time. It smacks of Wings at its goofiest. Of course even Wings had Paul McCartney in the band, and the man can write a charming melody. High points on the album include "Mr. Bellamy," a quirky, chamber-pop portrait that meanders through several movements, and the final minute of "Feet in the Clouds," where McCartney slices and dices his voice into lovely, machine-treated layers. "Dance Tonight," the opening song and lead single, is barely a song, more of a smiling aural snapshot of strummed mandolin and stamping foot. But in its simple grace the tune feels far more substantial than much of the deceptively orchestrated fluff that follows. For his 21st solo album McCartney gave the boot to Nigel Godrich -- the longtime Radiohead producer who coaxed such remarkable depth from the artist on 2005's "Chaos and Creation in the Backyard" -- and reunited with David Kahne , who produced Macca's 2001 disc, "Driving Rain" (as well as recordings by a slew of other artists from the Bangles to the Strokes). By the sound of it, Kahne was content to play with arrangements and knobs. He plumps and ornaments peppy ditties like "See Your Sunshine" and a dead-end blues called "That Was Me" with enough instrumental cheer to generate an effervescent vibe, if not quality songcraft. But there was no smart editing, no big-picture conversation, no quality control. McCartney needed someone to tell him that his exhortation on "Vintage Clothes" (Don't live in the past!) doesn't jibe with the "Ever Present Past" he celebrates so jauntily (and with so many '80s-style synths) a few songs earlier. Or that "Gratitude" is a bad song. Or that "Nod Your Head," a harsh and creepy amalgam of "Why Don't We Do It in the Road?" and "Live and Let Die," was an ill-advised way to close this lightweight album. &copy; Copyright 2007 Globe Newspaper Company.

See a photo you want? Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Monday, Jun 4, 2007 Posted on Mon, Jun. 04, 2007 reprint or license this 'Sopranos' chat: Who needs a therapist? Maybe the show's heart-stricken fans. It's a crime this show has to die next week, say the Inquirer's Jonathan Storm and Karen Heller. Splitsville: Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) and Tony Soprano (James Gandolfini). Not that she really helped. As `Sopranos' End Nears, So Does Tony's States Work to Lure Film, TV Production What was your favorite Sopranos' moment? How do you think the series will end? Well, that was certainly something. Unbelievable. I'm still reeling. What did you think? It is very rare for a TV show to have my heart racing while watching it, but last night's show had to be one of the best in recent memory of any TV series. It's hard to say what was more brutal, Melfi dropping Tony as a client after seven years or Phil trying to take out the top of Tony's crew. I think the episode and, it seems, the entire show, is stirring indictment of psychotherapy. The catty therapists citing limited data and Melfi's instant dropping of Tony in a totally unprofessional way. As Tony said, it really was immoral. Yes, the odious Eliot Kupferberg (played by the equally odious Peter Bogdanovich) violating therapeutic ethics is just as bad as Phil. What did you think of the botched job by the Italians? They killed the father of Phil's housekeeper or goomar, depending on which website you read. (HBO says it's the housekeeper but a lot of bloggers think she was his mistress.) Think that was an accident set up by the increasingly mysterious Paulie? Is it just me, or do you think that Paulie is the rat? Phil specifically chose not to kill him. He botched the Phil hit. Phil was tipped of by someone, that's why he skipped. I didn't see that at all, until you mentioned it. It's possible, but I still find it hard to believe. I though it strange that Phil ordered to take out Tony, Sil and Bobby, accomplishing the latter, pretty much incapacitating Sil and now searching for Tony but Paulie, a made man, was left out. He's been absent a lot and acting a bit wifty. He could definitely be working for Phil or the feds. Paulie is playing both sides of the fence. Phil say no to his hit and Paulie mess up the hit on Phil. Plus Tony wanted to whacky Paulie and had a change of heart. Sicilian by marriage: Tony shoulda taken Paulie out when he had the chance. He knew what to do and 'wussed-out'. He'll live (or more likely, die) to regret it. Phil said Paulie was not "in management." So he has a logical excuse, and it's possible Phil sent that lookalike guy into harm's way. I am a trusting soul. Two points 1. re therapy: Elliott's behavior at the dinner party was obscene, but also crystallized Melfi's ambivalence throughout the whole series. She doesn't truly believe, I don't think in whether her treatment of Tony is really having any effect, and Elliot's abuse of confidentiality, plus power over Melfi pushes her over the edge; second, the hits on Bobby and Silvio both reprise AJ's quoting of Livia to the effect that we all die in our own arms. Everyone else has left Tony; all he has is the gun. Tony has been left by Melfi and now has to leave Carmela. How soft is Bobby, not having his haunches up after meeting with Sil and Tony to discuss the possible ramifications of their actions against Phil, and then go about his business of building his toy train empire like it's just another day. No wonder he was such an easy hit. I thought Bobby's death scene was just so beautifully filmed. "The Blue Comet" (title of the show and name of a now defunct NYC-Atlantic City Express) was such a nice metaphor. Things were once so elegant. And the beautiful stationing of the litte plastic figures on the train set. "Oh, No, Mr. Bill," one of them seemed to be saying, holding her had to her face. And the incredible speeding trains, with Bobby crashing into the entire beautiful creation as little children screamed. That scene was amazing, worthy of Scorsese (honored again with a homage to ). Yes, it should of been called the Red Bullet. Bobby was always childlike, and the most endearing of the crew. What's T going to do when he's just left Paulie -- maybe -- and a bunch of drivers? The hit on Silvio was equally well-made and perhaps more difficult to film. And Mr. Chase and crew, in addition to indicting virtually every segment of modern American society also had a little insult for us in the audience. are the clowns who came out of the Bing and gasped and groaned as Silvio was popped and then the motorcylclist was knocked off his bike and crushed. By the way... did anyone else notice the priest in the crowd at 'The Bing'? Leave it to to make us laugh in the middle of such a sad and gruesome scene. Yes, there was so much collateral damage last night -- the cyclist (I agree that scene was amazing, the whole episode was), the bystanders at the train store, the strippers and clients at the Bada Bing, Tony's family. Didn't you love AJ's selfishness mirroring that of of his father? His response to Uncle Bobby's death was "I was already having so much trouble maintaining." Tony watched WWII movies. AJ is watching Iraq videos. Both suffer from depression and self-absorption. That whole amazing packed episode was only 49 minutes, with credits. There does not appear to be any way out for "T"... unless the feds can "rescue" him and he goes into witness protection. I think there are lots of ways out, but then you have to imagine what "out" will be. His family (both of them) is riven. Rebuilding will be almost impossible even if he does survive. Is there a 9/11 analogy here? Tony has no future. His family (both of them) are decimated by death - of the body and soul. He has no future and the final episode will cement that. There are two overriding ways the series can end: With a literal bang, for Tony or Phil, or quietly. David Chase, who co-wrote last night's episode, trends toward violence in the penultimate episode of each season. A colleague says he visited a Jersey bakery which claims to be the site of the last scene, suggesting a somber or poetic ending rather than an operatic one. Tony is already alone. But, then, he's been that way for some time. To me, that's the whole arc of the series. That even a man surrounded by two families is ultimately alone and in Tony's case, his multitude of sins. Tony could still turn to the feds. Don't forget- he threw away his italian sub after meeting with the fed at Sattrili's! He's ready to give up the life. I mean, after last week, who's left to protect??? What are the possibilities of a final duel between Tony and Phil? The writers have had Tony watch a bunch of western movies over the years? Well, I never watch previews for series, but in this case I feel it's part of my job, and Phil was certainly a presence in the preview, which was called "The Final Episode Ever," subtitled: "No More Hiding." Who's hiding from whom? Can you say "everybody"? I believe that Christopher playing the soundtrack from 'The Departed' was prophetic. All principle characters were dead at the end of that movie. Chase is looking to close the book on this entire series and the possibility of any stupid 'reunion' shows. Everyone's hiding. Money, or lack thereof, was also a big theme. With Bobby dead and Sil out of the picture, Paulie acting wifty, Tony hiding, Carmela worried about money, Janice asking for funds for Uncle Junior's rest home, it's a huge worry. Money is the engine, and the engine's stalled. I loved Janice talking about Uncle Junior's accountant. "With the larynx box, June thinks he's from Outer Space." I love Janice. She's so horribly wonderful. And I miss Junior and Johnny Sac, who was such a wonderful adversary though Phil is angrier. I miss them all. Nobody's talked about Carmela ... the scene at Artie's where she's putting the best face on Meadow's career decision, and Tony going to the mattresses ... strips away all of the years of denial she's been living in. Could she lie anymore to Charmaine? She's as bad as Tony with Artie. Sure, she's pleased about Meadow with Patrick Parisi, dating the son of an underling, and thinking about criminal law when, we all know, she would be representing the criminals, not prosecuting them. It was as artificial as her nails. Life may be harder for Carmela than for Tony at the end of all this. Absolutely. She's a junkie for the lifestyle. And here's my theory: Meadow, smart and competent, rises to become head of the family. It should be interesting regardless of the turnout this Sunday. If you think about it, there have been so many "Twin Peaks" moments the last couple of years. The dream sequence after T was shot was never again addressed, nor was the epiphany during the sunrise in Vegas. What do you think of the possibility of having all of our "dearly departeds" returning in the final episode as Tony lays dying? How about Chase doing a "prequel" to the show? Meadow and AJ, do we hear echoes of Michael and Fredo Corleone? Chase doesn't like to tie up thinks neatly. That's why he's a genius. I don't want a prequel with Gandolfini and Falco in bad wigs. We already had Sil for that. Also, let me just offer the three worst words in cinematic history: . We can only pray that someone gives Chase a lot of money to do an entirely different project. Any chance Tony lives through the next episode? For me, who lives and dies and so forth is certainly interesting, but I am dying inside that everybody will be gone after Sunday. The whole thing is dying, and it has been so fine for so long. I think I may be even sadder about this than I was about the end of Maybe Tony can pick up Lorelai as his goomar. Or Rory. Jon, you would be in heaven. He could marry Lorelia and have Rory on the side, and I would be in heaven. I think who lives and dies is important, though almost everyone has died, but it's more important where the series leaves us emotionally. I mean, Livia's death wasn't planned -- the fantastic Nancy Marchand died -- but you mourn her still. And the show has increasingly left Tony alone. He's isolated socially and emotionally. Uncle Junior was such an excellent foil. I still haven't forgiven Chase and Co. for making him daft. He always had the funniest lines in the show, and was a worthy emotional and political adversary. I love/loved Uncle Junior and Dominic Chianese who played him. The glasses were almost as good as Steve Van Zandt's hair. Are we all going to die, too? It's such a common thing with good television. Shows get canceled and millions of fans go crazy (people have sent, like, 14 tons of peanuts to CBS for some obscure reason to try to resurrect ) and then new shows come along. In the case of some, however, the loss really is palpable. has been as good as TV gets. Yes, next week I plan to make Carmela's baked ziti (found the recipe on the web) and uncork an excellent Barola to mourn. Not sure anything will replace this. I may have to start watching all over again with the first season. Jonathan, Your last comment says it all. Do you think Tony's changed at all over the course of the series? I do. I think, unfortunately for him, he has seen more clearly who he is and what he does. And that has made him even angrier and more violent. It's one thing merely to be a beast. It's quite another to be human and do inhuman things. I have always thought of Tony as King Lear, but now I'm seeing him more as Richard III. Interesting. Because the point of the therapists' dinner last night was that sociopaths -- and Tony is definitely that -- just perfect their bad behavior through talk therapy. They perfect their lies and the stories they tell themselves. I don't think he is a sociopath. He follows a lot of rules. And I do not take the conversation or the research at face value. I think it was just a convenient way for the psychotherapists to remain detached and above it all, as they always do. I think the instant dumping of Tony and the little jealous stuff from Elliott and the complete disregard for their rules says much more about the terribleness of the therapists than anything else. If what our colleague says about the bakery turns out to be true, perhaps it's a pun on 's "leave the gun, take the cannoli." This episode ended with Tony alone with his AR-10, a battle rifle that was gift from Bobby. Perhaps next week he takes the cannoli and puts down the gun after Phil is gone. Although Tony is in no position to take on the wrath of the NY crew. Phil started it, so I think Tony would have some support having eliminated a guy who defied the rules. The rules again. I guess I really don't care to speculate too much on how it's going to end. I would rather be surprised. They can't end with both Tony and Phil in hiding. That would seem corwardly and a fight that ends in a standoff, a riff on powerlessness that I don't think the show would explore in a final episode. One of them has to go down. I think it would have more power if it was Tony because he's the guy we've all come to know, and become strangely attached to, despite what a beast he is. I'm sure whatever happens, I'll be sitting there aghast and depressed. But we shouldn't forget. Right after, comes the premiere of , the new one from David Milch ( Hill Street Blues, NYPD Blue, Deadwoo d). He's no slouch, so maybe we'll all have something new to chat about. I'm there. Until -- sob - next week when we have our wake. Yup. See you, and all our fellow chatmates, who have such interesting ideas, then.

Call (215) 893-1999 or visit Monday, June 4, 2007 "The Sleeping Beauty" is the ultimate test for a dance company. The Pennsylvania Ballet passes the test in a revival of Tchaikovsky's fairy-tale ballet at the Academy of Music. "The Sleeping Beauty" stretches the company to its limits -- some of the court dances look underpopulated -- but the dancing is strong and secure. Peter Cazalet's traditional sets provide a handsome frame for the dancers. The court scenes look properly grand and stately, although the designer's muted costumes lack vivid color. For the forest scene, Cazalet conjures up a menacing tangle of trees that provides a dramatic backdrop for the confrontation between Prince Desire and the evil fairy before his kiss awakens Princess Aurora. This "Sleeping Beauty" marks a farewell for Valerie Amiss after 15 years with the company. As the Lilac Fairy, Amiss displays the grace and charm that have personified her dancing in a wide variety of roles. Arantxa Ochoa (Aurora) and Zachary Hench (Desire) added some star power to Friday evening's performance. The audience repeatedly broke into applause during their scenes together. Ochoa danced with care at her first appearance in the opening act. She struck form in the grand pas de deux in the wedding scene. Supported commandingly by Hench, Ochoa danced with a blend of elegance and quiet fire. Ochoa's lithe grace was matched by Hench's power. Hench proved to be a strong partner. He lifted Ochoa without effort and held her confidently. The final act celebrates the power of dance in a sequence of magical divertissements. Heidi Cruz-Austin (Diamond), Ian Hussey (Gold) and James Ihde (Silver) expertly performed the Precious Jewels pas de trois. Then Puss 'n Boots (Matthew Neenan) pursued the White Cat (Abigail Mentzer) in a playful duet. Adding to the pleasure was the spirited dancing of Maximilien Baud, Jonathan Stiles and Andre Vytoptov as the Three Ivans. Francis Veyette and Amy Aldridge left their imprint on the taxing duet for The Bluebird and Princess Florine. Veyette's physical power contrasted nicely with Aldridge's elegant dancing. Throughout the evening, the Pennsylvania Ballet's corps adds to the pleasure of this "Sleeping Beauty." The women contributed some relaxed but precise dancing in the second act. Beatrice Jona Affron and the Orchestra of the Pennsylvania Ballet provide solid support for the dancers. Summoning spirited playing from her musicians, the conductor generates excitement in the pit.

Add to My AOL Three New 'Transformers' Clips! Posted Jun 4th 2007 4:33PM by In case you didn't notice, the MTV Movie Awards last night. Since then, three new pretty cool clips have arrived online, one of which features an extended version of that Optimus Prime vs. Bonecrusher freeway fight scene that, honestly, left me slightly chucking (only because Bonecrusher looked as if he was roller-blading), but even so I still can't wait to see this flick. (In order to prove to you that us movie bloggers are indeed human, I've opted not to review in order to catch a midnight showing with my good friends. Man, it's films like this that have me feeling like a teenager again!) The second clip is also from a scene we've seen before (the helicopter attack scene), except it's extended to include talking with this hottie wife about how cute their baby is. But then a robot shows up to wreak havoc. Poor Josh. And, if you caught the MTV Movie Awards last night, then you probably already saw the third clip. At one point, Sarah Silverman does one of those movie spoof short film-type things, and finds herself face-to-face with Optimus Prime. This gave us our first heavy taste of how Peter Cullen sounds as Prime, as well as what it will look like with his mouth moving. I think he sounds pretty good, although I'm far from one of them crazy, die hard fans. Yeah, I had the toys and watched the cartoon -- but that was pretty much it. Thus, I'm heading into this film with more of a "wow, big robots fighting" attitude than a "let's see how ."

http://www.popmatters.com/pm/tv/reviews/41951/creature-comforts/&cid Creature Comforts - PopMatters Television Review Creature Comforts: Series Premiere : Mondays, 8pm ET (CBS) US release date: 4 June 2007 When they want to stick things in your rectum, well, that just flies in the face of nature. As Aardman Studios has demonstrated repeatedly, stop-motion claymation makes for an extremely engaging form of animation. What&#8217;s less consistently clear is the effectiveness of translating comedy from UK to US. A case could be made against CBS&#8217;s remake of Aardman&#8217;s for American TV as a successful one. The series cherry-picks segments from anonymous interviews with &#8220;everyday people,&#8221; putting words into the mouths of various claymationed animals. But without any adorable British accents, the show&#8217;s subjects seem almost too ordinary to captivate, like choosing to base a series on animating the talking head footage of those waiting in line at Wal-Mart. The ordinariness starts with Aardman&#8217;s signature style: it&#8217;s so recognizable&#8212;the round, protruding eyes and the quivering clay browline&#8212;that it&#8217;s not an exciting enough premise on its own. The inherent limitations of the animation style also prevent the large assortment of animal characters from capturing the kind of complexity that should be explored visually, especially with dialogue that mostly lacks introspection. For example, take the pair of apes engaged in a traditional grooming session, during which the groomer talks about how she enjoys a good &#8220;fixer-upper&#8221; in a man. The set-up seems straightforward, refusing to explore any further similarities between apes and people, rendering the comment and scene more anecdotal than insightful. seems to want to play it safe and light, never forcing a conclusion that isn&#8217;t immediately on the screen. In fact, visual irony is the series&#8217; main gag, one that is initially charming, even when it&#8217;s obvious. The first episode opens on a pair of dogs sniffing another dog&#8217;s butt, describing the odors therein in terms of fine wines&#8212;&#8220;Dark notes&#8230; hints of cassis, raisin&#8230; grape&#8221;&#8212;presumably the context of the interview is indeed a wine-tasting, as we hear a cork pop and a glass fill. However, the next few renditions of this premise are less cute, and by the time we encounter a turtle who likes to &#8220;take it slow,&#8221; or the male bird who can&#8217;t stop gushing over his beautiful ladybird (who, we see, has a lazy eye and missing teeth), the joke has worn thin. Yes, it occupies a primetime ("family hour") time slot on network, so it won&#8217;t have the latitude or moxie of Adult Swim, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that it can&#8217;t explore, with some relative depth, the humanity within animals or vice versa. Otherwise, what&#8217;s the point of the premise? But the humor stays simple and non-exploratory. Though the show doesn&#8217;t exactly suffer for its sanitized inclinations (in fact, it calls to mind the decidedly offensive and once clever , which also merges a make-believe world with our real one), it&#8217;s too willing to settle for obvious gags. &#8216; most riveting aspects are not the jokes or animation, but the brief character studies revealed through the actual interviews. If the stories were allowed to breathe a little, all you would need is Ira Glass, and you could call it . Such a moment is glimpsed when an old man, animated as a lion, is asked if he&#8217;s ever killed anyone (the question&#8217;s original context is never explained). He asks, &#8220;You mean ?&#8221; and then answers, &#8220;Never without a reason that was not normal.&#8221; What seems a grave and also perversely hilarious instant is jarringly abandoned when we cut back to a discussion of constipation by a hypochondriac parakeet. Given that not all subjects are as forthcoming, to mine for material, the series must not always be kind to its interviewees. And, that&#8217;s a good thing, because the less nice the show tries to be, the more compelling its subjects become. In a barn, a large pig missing several teeth begins to talk about her struggles with her doctor: &#8220;He said, &#8216;You will never walk again if you don&#8217;t take off some of that weight.&#8217; I thought, &#8216;I&#8217;ll show you.&#8217;&#8221; She pauses for a second, her large claymation eyes bulge, darting side-to-side. Then she says, &#8220;And you can see, I&#8217;m walking fine.&#8221; While the issues raised by the scene are clearly sizist (she&#8217;s animated as a very large pig) and classist (her accent and dental care denote &#8220;lower"), the subject&#8217;s own blind spot is glaringly exposed through the dialogue, rather than by setting or irony. What&#8217;s for certain is that the show is charming and utterly tasteful, even when it goes for potty humor. That constipated parakeet&#8217;s husband sits next to her while under a pile of his own bird poop: &#8220;I&#8217;ve never had any medical problems,&#8221; he explains with a plop. Sure, backs off from fully unpacking nearly every joke it sets up, but I suppose in that way, it&#8217;s comfortable indeed. &#151 4 June 2007 PopMatters Picks: The Best Albums of 2006 A Memory of Music The L-Words: An Interview with the Cardigans PopMatters @ Cannes: La Belle (Glorieuse) Communaut&#233; Internationale From the Cheap Seats The Fall of Foos Short Ends and Leader The Front Page: Critical Mess Buddy, Can You Spare a . . .

Move over, "Spamalot." The surreal, smart "Grey Gardens" and "Spring Awakening" are redefining Broadway. This week, Salon is looking back over the year on Broadway, in anticipation of the Photo by Joan Marcus Six years ago, Mel Brooks hit New York with his smash hit phenomenon "The Producers" and inadvertently ushered in a new era of musical theater, one in which the old-style musical comedy -- the kind with a book, lotsa yuks, pretty girls and grandstanding performances -- was rushed back into fashion. For nearly three decades, that sort of feel-good enterprise had been locked in the deep freeze, first by the lumbering domination of the British mega-musicals, then by the heady, medicinal exercises of the atonal Sondheimarati. Brooks reminded theatergoers what they had been missing: fun. But that era -- which resulted in the long runs of such self-mocking and satisfying shows as "Hairspray," "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" and "Spamalot" -- may now be over. When Brooks' new stage show, "Young Frankenstein," makes its expected bow on this fall, it might be too late to enjoy the era its author created, the atmosphere in which a show like "Frankenstein" would blossom. The reason? Two shows: "Grey Gardens" and "Spring Awakening."

Seacrest is known as a lot of things, slick "American Idol" ringmaster, hotshot radio deejay, ubiquitous E! channel host, but funny guy's not one of them. Which makes his scene-stealing cameo in "Knocked Up" such an amusing surprise. NEW YORK- news://newsclip.ap.org/3b373449-ea43-442b-8770-b3f26bce6f3a@news.ap.org Ryan Seacrest is known as a lot of things&mdash;slick "American Idol" ringmaster, hotshot radio deejay, ubiquitous E! channel host&mdash;but funny guy's not one of them. Which makes his scene-stealing cameo in "Knocked Up" such an amusing surprise. Even more so because he's the butt of the joke. Seacrest sends up his pompous image in the Judd Apatow-directed comedy about an ambitious entertainment reporter (Katherine Heigl) whose life is flipped when she learns she is pregnant. She takes her job seriously at E! Entertainment Television&mdash;but not as seriously as the film-version Seacrest, who launches into a riotous rant during a scene that lasts barely two minutes. Seacrest, playing himself, becomes ticked off on the set when Jessica Simpson throws off his busy schedule by arriving at her leisure for an interview. He angrily suggests that maybe he'll retaliate by asking for her thoughts on an "exit strategy" in the Middle East. "I don't understand the young talent in this town," the movie Seacrest goes on. "It doesn't make any sense. I got four jobs&mdash;hell, I'm more famous than half the people we talk to anyway!" The rant then escalates into an R-rated diatribe with Seacrest dropping the F-bomb and denouncing the superficial workings of the entertainment industry. The apoplectic host finally has to be ushered into the green room with a promise of a cookie in an effort to calm him down. Seacrest is not nearly as divalike in real life. ... Or is he? At the beginning of a recent telephone interview with the Associated Press, the 32-year-old took a moment to jokingly exercise his authority: "Hang on one second&mdash;"Linda, WHERE'S MY LUNCH?! ... Sorry, just kidding," he deadpanned, back on the phone. Seacrest, whose poker-faced demeanor during those ominous "Idol" elimination shows was spoofed recently on "Saturday Night Live," said he relished exposing his not-so-serious side in "Knocked Up." "Oh, I love it! I don't mind being the butt of the joke. ... It doesn't really bother me. I quite enjoy it," said Seacrest. He even suggested a headline for this story: "He's funny and YOU don't know it!" In the movie, he makes another statement: He can laugh at himself. "I believe that one of the things I've tried to do is work hard and take the business very seriously. ... But, at the same time, you can't take the (TV personality) role too seriously. Then you really begin to lose it." When it came time to film the scene, Seacrest&mdash;nervous about how he'd be "received by the movie world"&mdash;was delighted to "have fun and ad lib" with Apatow ("The 40 Year-Old Virgin"), who is big on improvisation and collaboration. "I'm not used to a script," Seacrest said. Apatow, he related, asked him: "Hey, can you use a bad word and make fun of a couple people and, at the end of this whole scene, really make sure you make fun of yourself?" His response: "Absolutely, let's roll." "This was a very therapeutic exercise," he said. "I mean, I didn't want to stop that day. It's a shame I only got to do it for however long I got to do it."

Knoxville sued over mousetrap stunt June 4, 2007 - 11:05AM An actor whose genitals were injured by a mousetrap is suing Jackass star Johnny Knoxville and a radio talk-show for $12.6 million. Perry Caravello alleges that Knoxville, program host Jimmy Kimmel and radio personality Adam Corolla, promised him $12 million for promotion of a movie if he carried out a stunt that inolved putting his genitals in a mousetrap. The stunt was intended as a promotion for the DVD release of , in which Carolla, Caravello and Kimmel all appeared. But the stunt went wrong and Caravello "was severely injured when the trap literally went on his manhood", according to papers filed in the Los Angeles Superior Court. It would seem to be a case of life imitating art, according to the 's description of the movie, which it calls an "elaborate hoax [and] an act of cruelty almost unparalleled in TV comedy annals." "Cameras both hidden and exposed capture the fun and pain when Caravello is inexplicably cast as the star of a supposed film called Windy City Heat, in which he portrays a character named Stone Fury, a hard-boiled Chicago 'sports private eye.' "It's all just a complete goof, of course. But the real Caravello doesn't know that," said the paper in its October 2003 review of the telemovie. Caravello is also claiming $600,000 for humiliation after the stunt-gone-wrong was distributed on the internet. send photos, videos & tip-offs to 0424 SMS SMH (+61 424 767 764), or us. on home delivery of the Herald - subscribe today Knoxville sued over mousetrap stunt Place a classified ad Copyright &#169; 2007.

Universal Accessibility: The Amazing Robert Florio All Work and No Play Makes You a Duller Desk Jockey? Monday, June 04, 2007 Posted by Matt Peckham A Brash [Entertainment LLC] Proposal I read about these guys a few months ago at , where blogger Ryan Olson noticed about the company's push to secure $150 million to produce "60 to 100 [major titles] over the next five years." In case you're not hearing trumpets when you read the words it's a startup co-founded by Thomas Tull, executive producer of the film Beefcake Ballet--err, I mean 300, the comic book derived Spartan boo-rah flick. Apparently Brash is already cooking with gas. For starters, they've secured not $150 but from investors like Abry Partners LLC, New York life Capital, and PPM America. What's more, according to the Wall Street Journal today , the company already has deals with five major Hollywood studios and licenses for 40 film properties, including 300 and the squirmy (but mostly silly) Saw horror flicks. The idea, according to Brash CEO Mitch Davis, is to counter the notion that movie-based games suck. He's right about the latter. Once in a blue moon you'll get a Chronicles of Riddick: Escape From Butcher Bay --actually superior to the related film--but more frequently stuff like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon , which suffer because they slavishly attempt to translate the cinematic experience. But say Brash succeeds. Is this a sign of things to come? I think it is, though it has less to do with making better games than resource consolidation. With development costs soaring, the game industry is looking for greater (if costlier) short term security to land long term windfalls. 1994 e-commerce startup Amazon.com took how many years to turn a profit? (Hint: nearly a decade.) Brash epitomizes that sort of business sense overlapping (and perhaps overturning) the model on which the game industry was founded. Instead of high schoolers and college students dreaming up games in their spare time on shoestring budgets, enter the age of the media "event." Contests, mobile phone games, TV spots, in-game ads, cross-media content, games that decipher films that decipher games, and a thousand other ideas smarter marketers than I'll ever be have dreamed up to blitz you...not so much with a game anymore, as an "experience," and one that can follow you around, from dawn to dusk. / 1000 max characters 5-to-1 Odds on Wii in Japan A Brash [Entertainment LLC] Proposal Adios Boot Camp, Aloha Parallels 3.0 Who Wants to be a Felon?

Hate commercials? Most people would answer yes with a bored sigh to that seemingly rhetorical question. But the television advertisement business hopes that you dont and that people actually do watch commercials. And since television turns a profit primarily by selling their audiences to interested advertisers, commercials are pretty financially important to the television medium. Advertisers and networks go to the Nielsen Ratings to put a price on ad space/time on television. Founder Arthur Nielsen invented in the 1940s what led to Nielsen Ratings dominant method of gauging audience numbers and percentages based on a representative sample. But if everyone hates commercials and therefore avoids them to the best of their availabilities, then why do advertisers pay through the nose to get on TV? It seems that Nielsen anticipated this question, and in response it recently began statistically investigating commercial minute ratings  roughly aimed at ascertaining just how many people watch certain ads, getting both the how much and the when. With new digital technologies, people dont need to even bother with TVs regularly scheduled programs. DVR lets them record their programs and thus enables them to fast-forward through the unwanted parts, namely commercials. Certain networks internet sites offer streaming video duplicates of their hit shows online, imposing only limited commercial interruption. And the masses are utilizing these new technologies and making their televisions regularly scheduled programs fit their regular schedules. According to Nielsen, 17 percent of American households have DVR capabilities, and 42 percent of those DVR-toting Americans view primetime broadcast shows primarily through DVR-playback. Nielsen now endeavors through its commercial minute ratings method  the results of which it released May 31  to track when people first view programs within three major categories: when they originally air, on DVR-playback within the same day, and on DVR-playback from one to seven days afterwards. Crunching all of these numbers should further perfect the statistics on not just television viewership but on commercial viewership, and thus change the way the ad business works. As previously speculated, people dont watch television ads, so the ad guys want ad rates to go down because why spend so much money trying to get ice to people who dont even buy ice? Nielsens new methodology found that people actually do watch commercials, whether when originally aired or when viewed on DVR-playback. Nielsen even revealed that some people watch a shows commercials more in DVR-playback than when originally aired, as with NBCs . As the business world shifts to follow these new findings, and as new digital technologies such as DVR become more accessible to the masses, Nielsens commercial minute ratings system could revolutionize the industry. If television programming follows the advertisers and if advertisers follow Nielsen and if Nielsen proves that cult shows like have better advertisement power in a new  and soon to be dominant  technology (thus increasing the price of their advertisement time/space), then cult shows might have more staying power than they have up until this point. Television might yet become an artistic medium, ironically through the efforts of practical businessmen. Talk to other readers about this story.

"I totally forgot that the nominations were coming out," says the actress, who does not own a television. "You know, when you have kids, it's what are they getting for lunch, and did we pack everything, and things like that. And my neighbor was on his way to the train, and he said, 'You were nominated.' " Ebersole -- who's slated to perform a number called "The Revolutionary Costume for Today" during Sunday's Tony telecast -- says she's "overjoyed," adding: "It's like, whatever happens is whatever's gonna happen, but to get this kind of recognition, 10 nominations, is awesome." 'Role of a lifetime' Despite a previous Tony win (in 2001, for "42nd Street"), the 54-year-old Ebersole, like many critics, considers "Grey Gardens" to be her "role of a lifetime." The musical was inspired by the same-named 1975 documentary about an eccentric mother and daughter, both named Edith Bouvier Beale, who were, respectively, the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. The musical's invented first act is set in 1941, when their East Hampton mansion, called Grey Gardens, was a showplace. Little Edie, the beautiful, sought-after society girl daughter, played by Erin Davie, is desperately trying to avoid being upstaged by her musically gifted, spotlight-hogging, middle-aged mother -- played by Ebersole. In Act 2, it is 30 years later, and the mother and daughter are sharing their now-dilapidated mansion -- the Grey Gardens of the documentary -- with dozens of cats. They alternate from affectionate chatter to bickering. "I think it was somewhat of a symbiotic relationship," Ebersole says. "But it was also great devotion and loyalty and a sense of responsibility that Little Edie had for her mother." Tony nominee Mary Louise Wilson (best featured actress) in the second act plays Big Edie, now elderly and bed-ridden, while Ebersole is uncanny as Little Edie, now middle-aged and given to wrapping skirts, sweaters and tights around her head. "I feel like I'm channeling her," Ebersole concedes. And how does she make such a radical transformation, from mother to daughter, during the brief intermission? "It's really just as simple as taking off my costume, putting on my new costume, changing my makeup and making sure I use the ladies room before I go onstage," says Ebersole, emitting a hearty cackle. On this afternoon, a few hours before another "Grey Gardens" performance, Ebersole is at the Walter Kerr Theatre, in her cozy dressing room filled with carefully chosen decorations, including several rosaries that dangle from a mirror. "I spend so much time here. This is my home away from home, so I just wanted to make it inviting and sort of like a sanctuary," she explains. Ebersole had long felt an affinity for "Grey Gardens." "I watched the documentary countless times before any of this came up 'cause I was fascinated with them as women, and I guess probably from an actor's point of view, everything's a character study," says the actress, who was also taken by "the honesty of the women, their unapologetic nature, their intelligence, their beauty, their wit and, really, sort of how did this happen?" She was "over the moon" when composer Scott Frankel, lyricist Michael Korie -- a Teaneck native -- and librettist Doug Wright asked her to become part of their musical. And after its sold-out off-Broadway run at Playwrights Horizons last spring, she was determined to "make sure that I did everything I could to get this show to Broadway," Ebersole says. "That's why I'm a producer as well. I was the first one to get investors involved." The success of the show, which opened on Broadway in November, is especially sweet for Ebersole, whose L.A. agent essentially told her, when she was 45, that she was "over the hill," she says. "The good thing is, he helped me get out of L.A.," Ebersole says. "I can look at him and say, 'Thank you,' because really, in the deepest part of my heart, what I did was to say, 'Well, I don't believe that. I don't believe I'm too old.' " Ebersole moved her family from Los Angeles, ultimately settling in Maplewood, where she lives with her husband, real estate agent Bill Moloney, and their three children, as well as three dogs, two cats and two newborn kittens -- strays that her husband rescued when they were just two days old. "After the shows, I was doing midnight feedings," says Ebersole, who, in a move that would make the cat-loving Beale ladies proud, shows off a photo of the "babies" on her digital camera. "Look at those two. Aren't they gorgeous?" When she moved East almost a decade ago, it was purely an act of faith, she says. "I didn't know what I was coming to. There was nothing concrete. It was just a belief that I had something to offer and that my gifts that God gave me were something to share," Ebersole says. "And then to have that belief supported by the universe and by this incredible role, it's just awesome. It's just a blessing beyond measure, really."

At times you see eye to eye with them. Or there are those experiences when they embarrass the hell out of you in front of others. There is also acceptance and understanding of each other's choices in life. Be it love, happiness, career choice, etc. Let's not forget how at times we so desire and beg that our parents not interfere, snoop, or push their way into your personal life. But then there comes a difficult and emotional time in our lives when the child becomes the parent, and the parent becomes the child who needs to be taken of. We love our parents so much, but be honest with yourself. There were or are times in your life that you just wish that the mechanisms within the relationship would change. That these so called "changes" would result in a much better outcome for both child and parent. All the above describes the relationship of Edith Bouvier & "Little" Edie Beale. the musical is based on the documentary of the same name by the Maysles Brothers. In 1976, these two brothers with a camera and recorder in tow, followed two women, a mother and daughter, exploring their relationship. But this was no normal mom and daughter by ANY means. is the true story of Edith Bouvier Beale ("Big" Edie) and her daughter Edie ("Little" Edie). Edith was the aunt and Edie was the first cousin to the future First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. On stage we only see Jackie O only as a child. Edith and "Little" Edie live in their own, private world within a massive, but decaying 28-room East Hampton mansion called "Grey Gardens". But the mansion is a dilapidated mess. Decaying walls that has chipped, faded paint on them. Or wallpaper that is left in shreds. Trash is piled up everywhere. Oh, and there are over 50 cats wondering all over the property. Grey Gardens was once a majestic, glorious mansion, but now it is in shambles. It was so far gone that the Suffolk County Board of Health and the local authorities were threatening to evict both women in 1972 This made national headlines, causing the rich and powerful Kennedys (including Jackie, now an adult) to get the mansion fixed and cleaned up. To see American "royalty" living like this was a shock and a huge scandal back in that time. They didn't have reality TV back then. Edith (or "Big" Edie) was born into blue blood royalty, as part of the Bouvier family. "Little" Edie was a young, beautiful actress who was engaged to the powerful Joseph Patrick Kennedy. She was known back then as "Body Beautiful Beale". But through a series of horrific situations, no marriage happened. To escape the pain and horror of her failed engagement, "Little" Edie fled to New York. Leaving her mother and Grey Gardens behind her. Eventually though Little Edie would return home to care for her mother. When Little Edie was 56 years old, Harper's Bazaar and Italian Vogue both published pictures of her wearing these bizarre turbans that become her trademark. Little Edie in the documentary states many times that she will still get her big break in show business someday and that she also will find that long, lost romance. Meanwhile, "Big" Edie is fragile, weak, and ill, practically confined to her bed. She even has a hot plate right next to her bed to fix her meals. In her youth, Big Edie was a trained soprano who entertained the rich and powerful with living room concerts at swanky soirÃ©es and parties all over the Hamptons. But now it is a tiny, shrill voice that shows fading glimmers of a once lovely singing voice. Big Edie would lose her life in 1977 while her daughter Little Edie would pass away in 2002. The documentary shows this strange, bizarre, conflicted, and very complicated relationship between mother and daughter in all its naked honesty. Can a documentary like this actually be transformed into a musical? Doug Wright, Scott Frankel, and Michael Korie thought so. the musical first came to life Off Broadway in March 2006 at Playwright Horizons. The production there would achieved critical acclaim and quickly transfer to Broadway in November 2006. Doug Wright's book very closely follows the documentary (at times word for word), mainly in the second act. The first act is more of exposition and early history for the audience. That way they can truly comprehend the Edies' emotional state in the second act. The book is robust and richly fulfilling. It actually could stand alone as a play, which is a rare quality in a book for a musical. Wright has given the characters much to explore and do so in vivid detail. Michael Korie's lyrics and Scott Frankel's music also at times take directly from the actual documentary. The score for the first act has a musical landscape that reminds you of Cole Porter or Jerome Kern. Korie uses verbatim Little Edie's own words for the second act opening number, "The Revolutionary Costume for Today". His Lyrics offer sublime subtext and completely fleshes out the characterizations. But alas some of Frankel's music is just not up to par. There are some filler numbers that tend to slow down the story. What really struck me as odd is that none of the big, dramatic ballads or the numbers that closed each act had any huge crescendos. I know that is not a requirement or a demand in musical theater, but for my tastes I particularly love that about musical theater. I am an enormous fan of the big, belting endings of songs. Sadly, the score for GG barely has any. However, the majority of the songs are soothing, pleasurable, and at times quite melodic to hear. Some of the best numbers from the score include: "Goin' Places", "Will You", "The Revolutionary Costume for Today", "The Cake I Had", "Around the World", and "The Girl Who Has Everything". Allen Moyer's scenic design is absolutely gorgeous. The outside of GG is wood shingles that look weathered and frayed. But through the screen door and windows (if you're sitting close enough) you can see inside the house. Much of the set is on electronic runways and the center has a turntable. Thus the scenery glides in and out, fly in and out, or turns around completely. This gives the scene changes a kaleidoscope effect. For the mansion itself it is elegance personified. The walls are powder blue, with its wooden trim in gleaming white. There is a grand staircase leading upstairs far upstage center. All around are smart, chic furniture pieces and even a grand piano. Completing its pristine elegance is brick-n-brac sprinkled all around the set. When it becomes the decayed mansion, it is all in hues of dull grey, black, and dark brown. The furniture is gone, with only broken bits and pieces that reflected what they once were. Moyer has mountains of newspapers and silver tin cans placed all over the set. You do get a sense of these two women were major rat pack addicts, not throwing a single thing away. William Ivey Long's costumes are divine creations, especially for the first Act. There are colorful prints and shimmering satins for the gowns and sharp tuxes for the men. For our two women, the second act costumes are combinations of other old garments all thrown together to make up some homeless person's outfit. But that's how the real Edies dressed back then. Every now and then there are performances on Broadway that just cannot be missed. They are so incredibly superb that you will bang you head on the wall if you miss them. People talk about those performances with such enthusiasm and joy, it seemed as though it was a religious experience of some sort. And a DVD bootleg copy of this jaw dropping performance is not the same as experiencing it live. There are performances that you must see at all costs. These are the roles and performances that people will talk about forever and that will go down in the history books. Examples from the last ten years or so include: Nathan Lane & Matthew Broderick in , the original cast of , Idina Menzel in , Hugh Jackman in The Boy From Oz , Heather Headley in ; and Victoria Clark in The Light in the Piazza You can certainly add Christine Ebersole to that distinguished list of luminary performances. Ms. Ebersole literally brings "Little" Edie Beale to phenomenal life. If you have seen the documentary, then you are in stunned disbelief in your seat because you swear that is the real Edie that has come back to life. I had the great joy of watching Ms. Ebersole give a scene stealing, diva-esque, grand performance in the revival of 42ND STREET a few years ago on Broadway. In fact, I saw the very matinee performance on the day of the Tony Awards. It would be just mere hours later that Ebersole would walk across the stage at Radio City Music Hall to pick up her Tony for that performance. Thus to see her in completely lose herself in the role, is just a theater lover's dream to observe. Ebersole completely dissolves her mind, body, and soul into Edie. In the second act is where she does some of the most mesmerizing, subtle work I've ever seen done on stage. She has Edie's voice and inflections, the nervous twitches and tics, and body movements that are all done to perfection. In the documentary there are times when Little Edie will talk over her mother and just give out comments, even though there is no one around. On stage Ms. Ebersole does the same. It is not upstaging or trying to steal focus whatsoever, but instead a brilliant actress doing her subtext. Ebersole will quietly throw out whispered commentary here and there, right into the audience's direction. All the while Big Edie is talking out loud. But then there's that final scene in Act Two. If you have seen it, then two words will remind you of what I'm talking about. The scarf. The Scarf. It will shatter you emotionally when you connect the emotional subtext with that simple piece of colorful chiffon. I was overwhelmed and constantly wiping tears off my face due to Ms. Ebersole's earth shattering performance. Vocally this gorgeous soprano turned her solos into gold, glittery masterpieces of song. Watch and hear the hypnotic brilliance she does to such solos as "Will You?" and "Around the World". Ebersole slays the audience in laughter with her comedic numbers as well. Her big second act comedic, tour de force number titled "The Revolutionary Costume For Today" is a grand showstopper! She also has some politically incorrect fun with the number "Hominy Grits" as well. Ms. Ebersole is magnificent and you will never forgive yourself if you miss this performance. Surrounding Ebersole is some outstanding talent that also earns buckets full of kudos. Ebsersole performing "Revolutionary Costume" from Mary Louise Wilson appears briefly at the top of the show and never returns till the second Act. But once she does she completely wins the audience over. By the end we have all fallen in love with this fragile, weak woman. She won me over the minute she sang her first big number, "The Cake I Had". I am a self-proclaimed cake addict, so this song just had me in constant giggles. Ms. Wilson shows heart tugging compassion and painful pathos later in such songs as "Jerry Likes My Corn" and "Another Winter in a Summer Town". Wilson and Ebersole have exquisite chemistry that radiates like a million sparklers. Both ladies are continuously throwing the "ball of energy" between them, and never once letting it fall. They play off each other like two twins connected by their hearts and minds. Theater magic like this is rare today. Another terrific performance is Matt Cavenaugh as "Joseph Kennedy Jr" in the first act and then the neighbor "Jerry" in the second act. With his dashing leading man looks, Cavenaugh actually resembles a young Kennedy, right down to that oh so familiar Kennedy speech pattern and dialect. Cavenaugh provides the charm of a future politician, but also the cold distain that comes with "keeping up with the image'....at whatever cost. But to watch this immensely talented actor bring Jerry (who does exist and is in the documentary) to such realistic life, it is sublime to watch. From the slow, slightly slurred speech patterns to the quiet, shy boy like disposition, he has "Jerry" pact down. It was such highway robbery that Cavenaugh was not nominated for a Tony Award this season. He is exceptional with his performance here. Providing praiseworthy work as well in the cast include Erin Davie as the Young "Little" Edie and John McMartin as the rigid grandfather, "J.V. 'Major' Bouvier". is heartbreaking & honest, both in its emotion and its presentation of stark reality. You see how time can change both mind and body and the gut wrenching realism from time's ravages, both physically and mentally. Don't miss out on this extraordinary musical and to also see a tour de force, history making performance from Ms. Ebersole. Both are not to be missed. The show is playing at Walter Kerr Theatre in New York.

Photos of the day Beach and Bay Homes Active Adult 55+ Housing Monday, Jun 4, 2007 Posted on Mon, Jun. 04, 2007 'Sleeping Beauty' gets royal treatment How many stars would you give Pennsylvania Ballet's opening-night performance of was just that - a beauty. Clocking in near three hours (with two intermissions), closes the company's season on a very classical note. It is a lush ballet with a full corps, more than 30 solo parts, dozens of colorful costumes and gorgeous scenery. Marius Petipa's legendary choreography to Tchaikovsky's famous score is supplemented with additional steps and staging by Janek Schergen, who danced with Pennsylvania Ballet in the 1970s and '80s. I'm often amazed at how hard the dancers work in a small company like Pennsylvania Ballet. For example, Abigail Mentzer - a lovely up-and-comer with striking red hair - danced two solos and in the corps de ballet on Friday night. And several principal dancers showed up in surprising roles. Julie Diana was onstage only briefly in the second act. Amy Aldridge danced the role of Princess Florine, a wedding guest, in Act 3. And Riolama Lorenzo was the evil fairy Carabosse, a role that in other companies often goes to a retired dancer or a man dressed as a woman. Lorenzo was wonderfully fiery and passionate in the part, however. Arantxa Ochoa was a playful, expressive Aurora (Sleeping Beauty). She has characteristics I wish more dancers in the company had: She attacks every role, projects confidence and knows how to gracefully cover up mistakes. Zachary Hench, who danced the role of Prince Desire, usually performs with exceptional bravura. He looked a bit tired on Friday night, though. Valerie Amiss tackled some difficult pointe work as the Lilac Fairy, Aurora's savior and matchmaker. Amiss, a soloist who has been with the company for 15 years, will retire at the end of this run. There were a few missteps Friday night. The most noticeable was when Heidi Cruz-Austin fell off her pirouettes early in the Precious Jewels pas de trios. But she must have had a talk with herself backstage, because she came back a few moments later much stronger in the next section. Ballet isn't easy, but I want it to look as though it is. As the season closes, my wish for next year is for every dancer to look more polished in every performance. Most of them are good enough, but they often seem to lack confidence. The Pennsylvania Ballet will repeat Thursday through Saturday at the Academy of Music, Broad and Locust Streets. 215-893-1999.

But the results have been decidedly mixed, leading to a checkered reputation for the quality of movie-based games and a wariness between game makers and Hollywood. Brash is producing videogames based on movies, including the 'Saw' horror series. A new games start-up, Brash Entertainment LLC, now plans to better merge the creative talents from both industries, in large part by focusing entirely on producing games based on movies, television shows and other entertainment properties instead of developing its own content. Recently formed in Los Angeles by veterans from both industries, Brash announced today that it has raised $400 million from investors including Abry Partners LLC, New York Life Capital Partners and PPM America. That is a whopping sum in the games business, where attempts to create major companies are rare because of tough competition from an array of well-entrenched publishers and developers like Inc. and others. Brash says it has cut deals with five major Hollywood studios, licensed 40 film properties, including Corp.'s "Saw" horror series, and is actively developing 12 games. Brash's bet comes as at least one big company -- EA, the world's largest games publisher -- is increasing its development of original games and lessening its dependence on Hollywood properties, which can come with high licensing fees and other restrictions. But Brash believes the growth of the games market has created room for a new player, particularly one with a special emphasis on translating movies into high-quality interactive entertainment. To make a mark, Brash will have to demonstrate it can consistently make top-notch games, rather than the hastily pumped-out titles that have tarnished the image of movie-based games in the eyes of consumers and Hollywood executives. "Across the board, they [movie-based games] haven't met industry expectations," says Mitch Davis, chairman and chief executive officer of Brash. Examples of the game industry's misfires with Hollywood properties stretch back to the days when joysticks first became fixtures in homes. Atari made an infamously bad game in the early 1980s for its Atari 2600 console based on the hit Steven Spielberg movie "E.T. the Extraterrestrial," with millions of unsold copies ending up in a dump in New Mexico. More recently, EA released a game based on "Superman Returns" to negative reviews; the game also came out months after the movie's theatrical release. There are some notable exceptions. Activision's "Spider-Man 2"-based game and EA's titles based on the "Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter" movie franchises were all enormous commercial successes. Game and movie industry executives trace the problems of movie-based games, in part, to the difficulty of translating a linear medium like movies into a compelling interactive game experience. Because one of the big attractions of doing a movie game is that game makers can piggyback on marketing campaigns for the film, game makers are often forced to rush their titles to market, compromising quality. "By the time we greenlight a film and license that to publishers, the amount of time we're often giving them and access to resources -- it's so challenging," says Kevin Tsujihara, president of Inc.'s Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Group, which has a deal to distribute Brash games to retail stores. Brash believes it can do better. One of the company's founders is Thomas Tull, an investor who, as chairman of Legendary Pictures, helped finance movies like "Superman Returns," "Batman Begins" and the Spartan-warrior epic "300." Mr. Tull, an avid gamer himself, says he saw an opportunity to help create a games company because of the industry's growth and helped arrange the financing of Brash through private-equity investors. "It's hard to find sectors this big growing this fast," Mr. Tull said in an interview at Brash's headquarters in Hollywood. Other members of the team include CEO Mr. Davis and Brash President Nicholas Longano, both of whom last year sold a videogame advertising company, Massive Inc., to Corp. for more than $200 million. Larry Shapiro, a former agent with the Creative Artists Agency, is Brash's chief creative officer. Brash will hire other independent game makers in the U.S. and abroad to do technical development work on games, though their efforts will be overseen by in-house producers. Brash says it will get involved with conceptualizing games with movie makers, in some cases even before the films are greenlighted by studios. Brash executives say this is partly the result of rising interest from directors and other Hollywood talent in game making. Yet Brash's much larger competitors aren't all backing away from Hollywood. While EA is boosting its original-game development, the company is still actively seeking to license major entertainment properties for development in games, says Patrick O'Brien, the EA vice president of business affairs. "A number of us are all making movie games and will continue to do so," says Mr. O'Brien. "We don't think there's a void to be filled." The Redwood Shores, Calif., company is working on a game due out this fall based on "The Simpsons" TV series.

Not one Johnny, of course, but a whole crew of Sparrow clones, courtesy of Jack's half-drunk, half-crazy hallucinating mind. After forcing the audience to endure 33 minutes of mindless theme park pirate shenanigans, we are treated to not one but several Johnny Depp's, the original being the very reason Pirates Of The Caribbean has met with worldwide success. Indeed, has always been a Disney-helmed vanity piece for the under-appreciated Depp, with some standardized action sequences to boot. Disney's marketing and name recognition plus Depp's first ever mainstream performance (though still a bit daffy) made pirates cool again. The first installment of Pirates Of The Caribbean was a mild surprise and was timed perfectly -- just when audiences were craving a different style of action choreography (not involving flipping cars and the super-men who catch them) and a new breed of action superstar: the post modern, alien anti-hero. The sequel capitalized on the first movie's popularity and Hollywood's long over due fascination with Johnny Depp, one of the best pound-for-pound actors in all of show business. Unfortunately, the number three is often a jinx in Hollywood, as most recently, At The World's End stubbornly refuses to let the franchise die and stabs us repeatedly with overblown action sequences, a whole rum bottle of convoluted plot twists (half empty as opposed to half full) and a variety of characters, some returning and some all new. (Yes, Keith Richards stars as Captain Teague...for no apparent reason) The story sees Elizabeth, Will and Barbossa rescuing Jack Sparrow from the land of the dead. Eventually they must face their enemies, not limited to Davey Jones, Lord Cutler Beckett, Sao Feng and a giant woman that you might remember. If you're thinking that seem slow-moving and subtle, then you have the right idea. The plot doesn't really matter, as the main points of the story are obvious: you can't trust anybody, everybody dies but somehow comes back, and a couple of young birds are in love. The humor of the movie is neither subversive or outrageous - more like scatter shot and blink-and-you-miss-it. What really matters here is three hours of sword fighting, cannon firing, fearless swinging and sailing, and gratuitous monkey shots. The combination worked well for the first two films, but the latest episode of this non-interactive theme park ride finally wears the audience out. Unlike the Pirates Of The Caribbean attraction, which will always be entertaining because it involves live theater and real time stunt work, the limitations of pre-recorded and finely edited films are all too evident in a movie this ambitious. We are required to sit patiently, awkwardly, as the noisy movie gets to its under-developed point. (Some three hours later) By nature, Disney may not understand the concept of letting a good thing die since they manufacture everything from characters to rides to clever ideas and positive buzz - anything that's vaguely salable, of course. Since we assume that Disney is the type of company that would ruthlessly work poor Mickey Mouse twenty years past his retirement age, we can also safely predict that there will be Pirates Of The Caribbean 4, 5, 6 and however many more sequels they can produce until audiences began to say "Yar, it blows!" We can't blame Johnny Depp for his enthusiasm to ride the Jack Sparrow character into hell. After all, this may be his final voyage for mainstream success. We can't blame Disney for mass-marketing a good idea, it's simply what they do best. We can only blame ourselves for gluttonizing this cinematic treat from 2003 and finally getting sea sick on our third helping.

Sabean, and it's time to go Better times bring worse traffic Spector jury hears Clarkson letters, e-mails about life struggles By LINDA DEUTSCH AP Special Correspondent Article Launched: 06/04/2007 10:23:22 AM PDT LOS ANGELES- The jury in Phil Spector's murder trial on Monday heard e-mails and letters in which shooting victim Lana Clarkson said she was "at the end of my rope" and expressed despondency about her acting career, but the judge rejected a defense effort to introduce her writings about living in a home where an actress committed suicide in the 1930s. The defense used the e-mails and letters in cross-examining a deputy medical examiner, Dr. Louis Pena, about his finding that Clarkson death from a gunshot fired in her mouth was a homicide, not a suicide. Pena said he did not see most of the material, and when questioned about most of it, said it would not have changed his opinion. Clarkson, an actress best known for her role in Roger Corman's 1985 cult classic "Barbarian Queen," was 40 when she died in Spector's foyer after going home with him from her job as a nightclub hostess on Feb. 3, 2003. Clarkson's letters to friends and a doctor in preceding months were read aloud by a defense attorney. They included the phrases "I'm at the end of my rope here" and "I was at the end of my tether." To one friend she wrote, "You know me, Polly Positive. But (expletive) this year has been the worst. I began to question my talent. ... I've been questioning myself as much as I have ever done." In letters and medical records introduced by the defense there was an indication she was plagued by constant headaches and for a time could not function because of them. She had also been on strong prescription narcotic medications but in her later communications she said she had discontinued them and had stopped drinking. She also wrote at one point, "This has been definitely the most difficult year of my life. My finances are a shambles and I am on the verge of losing everything." Pena said he had not seen any of these documents. "Did you see any reports when Ms. Clarkson in 2002 went to someone to get her subconscious repositioned," asked attorney Christopher Plourd. "Would you like to know about that?" Plourd asked. Clarkson also wrote about how in late 2001 she broke both wrists, including 22 fractures, was hospitalized and was on disability for an extended period. Plourd asked Pena whether Clarkson's shooting could have been accidental and showed him notes he wrote during a meeting with prosecutors on Oct. 14, 2003. Explaining the notes, Pena said, "I'm saying accidental discharge is difficult to determine ... guns don't go off accidentally in a mouth. Someone has to pull the trigger." In the same notes, he said, "Women do not usually shoot themselves. Women are more likely to ... overdose." At the end of the document he noted he wanted to collect more data on women who shoot themselves. But Pena testified he was too busy to follow through. In redirect questioning, prosecutor Alan Jackson read the entirety of the letters and e-mails, saying they needed to be placed in context. "I really feel like I'm losing it. I'm kind of feeling like giving up the dream and therefore the struggle," said one letter. Jackson asked Pena if that sounded like an actress contemplating giving up career goals rather than suicide. The judge's ruling on Clarkson's writings about the 1930s suicide involved a document from her computer that had been characterized as having accounts of her having visions of the long-dead actress. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler on Friday indicated he would likely allow the material, but after reading it during the weekend he returned to court and sternly indicated he found it so different than the defense characterizations that he checked to see if he had the right document. Although the defense said its computer experts found that the document had been worked on or saved as recently as 2001, the judge said it was not a diary and the most recent life story material was from 14 years before Clarkson's death. He read aloud the passage about the 1930s actress, which showed that a Clarkson roommate had a friend who was "psychic" and wouldn't come into their home because of "the presence." Clarkson wrote that she decided to investigate and found a Hollywood history book with an account of Broadway actress Aleta Alexander, who shot herself to death in a yard at the same address after being unable to get movie roles and learning her husband was spending time with other women. Clarkson wrote that on a few occasions she and others saw a shadowy figure move through the yard but found no one when they went to investigate. She noted she had the "feeling" several times that someone was in the house. "It stands to reason as we were struggling actors," said the passage, which the judge noted ended with an exclamation point. "And this is important how?" the judge asked the defense before declaring that nothing in the document was relevant. Spector, 67, rose to fame with the hit-making "Wall of Sound" recording technique in the 1960s. The Mercury News is pleased to let readers post comments about an article at the end of the article.

At the center of the legal dispute is energy magnate Michael Polsky and his wife of 31 years Maya Polsky. A Cook County judge awarded Maya Polsky 176 million in cash and assets in October. The figure represents half of the couple's estate. Today, the judge amended the figure to nearly $184-million because previously omitted assets increased the overall value of the estate. Maya Polsky's lawyers say she was her husband's confidant and should be considered a partner in his success. If it stands, the award would be a record in Illinois. The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers says it knows of no bigger award nationally. Michael Polsky's attorney says he plans to appeal the ruling. Copyright 2007 The Associated Press.

Johnny Depp, who stars at Captain Jack Sparrow in the hit series, was also victorious, picking up the Best Performance Prize. The 43-year-old actor received a standing ovation when he took to the stage at the Hollywood event to accept his award. Thanking audiences, Johnny said: âI&#8217;m not very good at this kind of thing, but I just want to say thanks to all of you guys. I&#8217;m deeply touched.â Will Smithâs son, Jaden, won the Breakthrough Performance award for his role in âThe Pursuit of Happynessâ. The eight-year-old made his movie debut alongside his father in the moving tale based on a true story last year. Veteran star Jack Nicholson won Best Villain for his role in Martin Scorseseâs multi-Oscar-winning movie âThe Departedâ, while Sacha Baron Cohen added to his awards cabinet with the Best Comedic Performance prize for âBorat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstanâ. Lindsay Lohan, who had been due to present an award at the event, failed to attend. Despite checking into Malibuâs Promises rehab centre last week, the actress was rumoured to be planning a surprise appearance at the bash. However, Lindsay, 20, was spotted leaving the treatment centre â where she is scheduled to be staying for a month â to go to church. But it was Paris Hilton who was the talk of the night. The hotel heiress attended the ceremony, despite being close to the end of the countdown to her prison sentence. Paris, 26, who has now begun her 23-day sentence, said: âI&#8217;m definitely scared but I&#8217;m ready to face my punishment. My friends and family and my fans have supported me and it&#8217;s been really helpful in this really scary time.â The blonde socialite checked herself into prison hours after leaving the bash.

http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=T&ct=us/1i-0&fd=R&url=http://www.kare11.com/news/national/national_article.aspx%3Fstoryid%3D256101&cid=1116967496&ei=h4BkRteEHIL0rQO9rMChBg kare11.com :: KARE 11 TV - Court finds FCC's policy on expletives "arbitrary" Court finds FCC's policy on expletives "arbitrary" A federal appeals court Monday found that a new Federal Communications Commission policy penalizing accidentally aired expletives was invalid, saying it was "arbitrary and capricious" and might not survive First Amendment scrutiny. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did not, however, outlaw the policy outright. It ruled in favor of a Fox Television-led challenge to the policy and returned the case to the FCC to let the agency try to provide a "reasoned analysis" for its new approach to indecency and profanity. The broadcasters had asked the appeals court last year to invalidate the FCC's conclusion that profanity-laced broadcasts on four different shows were indecent, even though no fines were issued. Included in the arguments were references to a January 2003 broadcast of the Golden Globes awards show by NBC when U2 lead singer Bono uttered the phrase "f------ brilliant." A year later, the FCC said the "F-word" in any context "inherently has a sexual connotation" and can be subject to enforcement action. David Fiske, an FCC spokesman, said the commission was reviewing the decision and "we'll respond as soon as we finish that review." A spokesman for Fox did not immediately return a phone message for comment. In a 2-to-1 ruling, the appeals court said it found that the FCC's new policy regarding so-called fleeting expletives "represents a significant departure from positions previously taken by the agency and relied on by the broadcast industry." The appeals court said agencies are free to revise their rules and policies but it said they must provide a reasoned analysis, something the FCC had failed to do. In a majority opinion written by Judge Rosemary Pooler, the appeals court said all speech covered by the FCC's indecency policy is fully protected by the First Amendment. "With that backdrop in mind, we question whether the FCC's indecency test can survive First Amendment scrutiny," the appeals court said. "For instance, we are sympathetic to the Networks' contention that the FCC's indecency test is undefined, indiscernible, inconsistent, and consequently, unconstitutionally vague." The court said it could understand why the networks argue that the FCC's indecency policy "fails to provide the clarity required by the Constitution, creates an undue chilling effect on free speech and requires broadcasters to 'steer far wider of the unlawful zone."' "Indeed, we are hard pressed to imagine a regime that is more vague than one that relies entirely on consideration of the otherwise unspecified 'context' of a broadcast indecency," it said. "It appears that under the FCC's current indecency regime, any and all uses of an expletive is presumptively indecent and profane with the broadcaster then having to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission, under an unidentified burden of proof, that the expletives were `integral' to the work. "In the licensing context, the Supreme Court has cautioned against speech regulations that give too much discretion to government officials," the court said. The appeals court gave a nod to what it called "today's realities" when it mentioned the ability of parents to limit what their children see with technological tools that recently have been made available. "The proliferation of satellite and cable television channels -- not to mention internet-based video outlets -- has begun to erode the 'uniqueness' of broadcast media, while at the same time, blocking technologies such as the V-chip have empowered viewers to make their own choices about what they do, and do not, want to see on television," the appeals court wrote. In a dissent, Judge Pierre Leval said the FCC had given a "sensible, although not necessarily compelling, reason" for its new policy. He noted that the FCC had concluded that the F-word "is of such graphic explicitness in inevitable reference to sexual activity that absence of repetition does not save it from violating the standard of decency."

But the results have been decidedly mixed, leading to a checkered reputation for the quality of movie-based games and a wariness between game makers and Hollywood. Brash is producing videogames based on movies, including the 'Saw' horror series. A new games start-up, Brash Entertainment LLC, now plans to better merge the creative talents from both industries, in large part by focusing entirely on producing games based on movies, television shows and other entertainment properties instead of developing its own content. Recently formed in Los Angeles by veterans from both industries, Brash announced today that it has raised $400 million from investors including Abry Partners LLC, New York Life Capital Partners and PPM America. That is a whopping sum in the games business, where attempts to create major companies are rare because of tough competition from an array of well-entrenched publishers and developers like Inc. and others. Brash says it has cut deals with five major Hollywood studios, licensed 40 film properties, including Corp.'s "Saw" horror series, and is actively developing 12 games. Brash's bet comes as at least one big company -- EA, the world's largest games publisher -- is increasing its development of original games and lessening its dependence on Hollywood properties, which can come with high licensing fees and other restrictions. But Brash believes the growth of the games market has created room for a new player, particularly one with a special emphasis on translating movies into high-quality interactive entertainment. To make a mark, Brash will have to demonstrate it can consistently make top-notch games, rather than the hastily pumped-out titles that have tarnished the image of movie-based games in the eyes of consumers and Hollywood executives. "Across the board, they [movie-based games] haven't met industry expectations," says Mitch Davis, chairman and chief executive officer of Brash. Examples of the game industry's misfires with Hollywood properties stretch back to the days when joysticks first became fixtures in homes. Atari made an infamously bad game in the early 1980s for its Atari 2600 console based on the hit Steven Spielberg movie "E.T. the Extraterrestrial," with millions of unsold copies ending up in a dump in New Mexico. More recently, EA released a game based on "Superman Returns" to negative reviews; the game also came out months after the movie's theatrical release. There are some notable exceptions. Activision's "Spider-Man 2"-based game and EA's titles based on the "Lord of the Rings" and "Harry Potter" movie franchises were all enormous commercial successes. Game and movie industry executives trace the problems of movie-based games, in part, to the difficulty of translating a linear medium like movies into a compelling interactive game experience. Because one of the big attractions of doing a movie game is that game makers can piggyback on marketing campaigns for the film, game makers are often forced to rush their titles to market, compromising quality. "By the time we greenlight a film and license that to publishers, the amount of time we're often giving them and access to resources -- it's so challenging," says Kevin Tsujihara, president of Inc.'s Warner Brothers Home Entertainment Group, which has a deal to distribute Brash games to retail stores. Brash believes it can do better. One of the company's founders is Thomas Tull, an investor who, as chairman of Legendary Pictures, helped finance movies like "Superman Returns," "Batman Begins" and the Spartan-warrior epic "300." Mr. Tull, an avid gamer himself, says he saw an opportunity to help create a games company because of the industry's growth and helped arrange the financing of Brash through private-equity investors. "It's hard to find sectors this big growing this fast," Mr. Tull said in an interview at Brash's headquarters in Hollywood. Other members of the team include CEO Mr. Davis and Brash President Nicholas Longano, both of whom last year sold a videogame advertising company, Massive Inc., to Corp. for more than $200 million. Larry Shapiro, a former agent with the Creative Artists Agency, is Brash's chief creative officer. Brash will hire other independent game makers in the U.S. and abroad to do technical development work on games, though their efforts will be overseen by in-house producers. Brash says it will get involved with conceptualizing games with movie makers, in some cases even before the films are greenlighted by studios. Brash executives say this is partly the result of rising interest from directors and other Hollywood talent in game making. Yet Brash's much larger competitors aren't all backing away from Hollywood. While EA is boosting its original-game development, the company is still actively seeking to license major entertainment properties for development in games, says Patrick O'Brien, the EA vice president of business affairs. "A number of us are all making movie games and will continue to do so," says Mr. O'Brien. "We don't think there's a void to be filled." The Redwood Shores, Calif., company is working on a game due out this fall based on "The Simpsons" TV series.

"I don't consider anything in this particular document significant," Judge Larry Fidler told the court of the manuscript written by B-movie actress Lana Clarkson. Spector, 67, is alleged to have gunned down Clarkson at his Los Angeles mansion in February 2003 just hours after meeting her in a Hollywood nightclub. He denies the charges of second-degree murder, and Spector and his defence team have argued at the trial which started on April 30 that the 40-year-old Clarkson was drunk and depressed and killed herself in his home. The defence had sought to enter as evidence writings by Clarkson which they say were a diary in which she catalogued her depression, her past drug abuse, her alcoholism and her fascination with guns. But deputy prosecutor Alan Jackson said the manuscript was a fictional work and was at best semi-autobiographical, and was written ahead of a drama course. The judge agreed with the prosecution, ruling that the manuscript had "no probative value whatsoever". Spector's lawyers also wanted to cross-examine the coroner, Louis Penna, who carried out the autopsy on Clarkson, and testified last week that the gun had been forced into her mouth. Defence lawyer Christopher Plourd said the coroner had not been aware of Clarkson's state of mind when he carried out the autopsy. Free on a $US1-million ($1.21 million) bail during the trial and spared the death sentence by prosecutors, Spector faces 15 years to life in prison if convicted of second-degree murder. Prosecutors have alleged that Spector has a "rich history" of violent outbursts against women. Four have testified at his murder trial that he threatened them with guns after flying into a drunken rage. Spector, the reclusive musical genius who pioneered the 1960s Wall of Sound recording technique, is alleged to have killed 40-year-old Clarkson just hours after meeting her at the Sunset Boulevard nightclub, The House of Blues. He shot to fame for his work with The Beatles, Tina Turner, The Righteous Brothers, The Ronettes and The Ramones.

The third installment of the "Pirates of the Caribbean" trilogy earned an estimated $43.1 million this weekend, according to the Associated Press, bringing the film's domestic total to $216.5 million since its May 24 release. That is less than last year's "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," which had made $258.4 million after two weekends. "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" earned more than $140 million in its opening weekend, breaking a record for the four-day Memorial Day holiday weekend. Movie industry watchers say the second-weekend drop-off for "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" is typical of popular summer films with major openings. Most films nowadays aim to have a major opening weekend and push to have more viewers see the film during that first weekend. A spokeswoman for Walt Disney Pictures says she expected a large drop-off in the second weekend. Internationally, "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End" brought its total to $625.3 million, after an additional $105.4 million this weekend. This weekend's box office totals: 1. "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," $43.2 million. 2. "Knocked Up," $29.3 million. 3. "Shrek the Third," $26.7 million. 4. "Mr. Brooks," $10 million. 5. "Spider-Man 3," $7.5 million. 6.

Spector&#145;s lawyers described the manuscript from Clarkson&#145;s computer as including accounts of her having visions of a dead actress who killed herself with a gun. Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler had indicated Friday that he likely would allow the material. He read aloud the passage about the dead actress, which showed Clarkson had found the account in a book about the history of Hollywood. And rather than visions, there was a description of seeing shadows pass a window. Fidler said he would consider allowing the defense to introduce the material when it calls its own experts, but not to cross-examine the coroner. Clarkson, who was 40, had met him for the first time at her job as a hostess in a VIP room at the House of Blues on the Sunset Strip. She was best known for her role in Roger Corman &#145;s 1985 cult film "Barbarian Queen." -- -- -- --

Arnold, Special for USA TODAY With no high-profile sequels opening, Hollywood caught its breath over the weekend. May's popcorn blockbusters &#8212; Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End &#8212; were expected to slug it out for the top three spots, and hung on to No. 1 its second week. But its estimated $43.2 million is a drop of 62.4% from its $115 million three-day opening. The weekend's tally takes ' domestic gross to $216.5 million, according to estimates from Nielsen EDI.

Nikki Rocco, president of domestic distribution for Universal Pictures, says the film may have the same long legs as , which opened in August 2005 to $21.4 million and earned $109.2 million by December. "We have great exit polls," Rocco says. "We're hoping it's the summer sleeper." finished third with $26.7 million. The film trails its predecessor by about $60 million at this point. "It's difficult for a franchise to maintain equal momentum through the third picture, so it's not surprising that these major sequels are grossing less than their predecessors, even if they open better," says Brandon Gray of BoxOfficeMojo. continued its freefall with $7.5 million in its fifth weekend.

"Our job is to get as many seats available opening weekend as we can. We really don't turn people away anymore, so you expect drops like this. They've become the norm." Gregg Kilday, film editor for , agrees. "The strength and weakness of the three sequels is that their business has been very front-loaded. What they may be lacking is a certain repeat business, but that business may show up when people buy the DVD."

Call (212) 362-6000 or visit NEW YORK -- Don't let that innocent, fairy-tale look fool you. The new "Sleeping Beauty" that American Ballet Theatre unveiled Friday at the Metropolitan Opera House amounts to a radical revision and a shocking $2-million blunder. The 1890 "Sleeping Beauty" is not merely a ballet classic. Its plot offers a metaphor for classicism, which searches for perfection in the past, and its history has been a series of rediscoveries. Despite choreographic alterations, Diaghilev's 1921 staging and its old, Royal Ballet offspring were recollections of lost paradise vouchsafed to a fallen world. Ballet being what it is, however, "The Sleeping Beauty's" impermanence allowed faulty memories and ambitious ballet masters to add and subtract. Then, something like a miracle occurred, in 1999, when the Kirov Ballet employed surviving notations to reproduce the original "Sleeping Beauty," true and complete. That production was the ultimate re-awakening, establishing a lofty standard. It clarified what ABT has now, once more, confused. Perhaps it was the inapproachability of this summit that led artistic director Kevin McKenzie and collaborators Gelsey Kirkland and Michael Chernov to take ABT in another direction, larding hallowed choreography by Marius Petipa with novelties and substituting story-book intimacy for grandeur. Tony Walton and Willa Kim's playful designs border on tacky, but are less dire than those the late Maria Bjornson concocted for the Royal. ABT's new "Beauty" reflects the Kirov revival in some ways. It incorporates the wonderful pantomime in which King Florestan condemns and then forgives retainers who have discovered a spindle. And it includes Tchaikovsky's lyrical violin meditation, here supporting a fantasy in which fairy knights carry Prince Desire swooping past Aurora as she slumbers in an eagle-prowed boat. Can anyone forget how the Kirov's guest conductor, Gianandrea Noseda, turned to kiss the violin soloist after every performance of the meditation? ABT's production is not exactly a Tchaikovsky love-fest, since great hunks of dance music have been slashed from Act III, while preserving a lengthy entr'acte so Carabosse and her entourage of faceless beetles can ensnare and torture the Prince. Skewing the musical plan, in Act III the Lilac Fairy returns to dance the "Gold" variation. Attempts to make the ballet more theatrical include fairy flights achieved with lifts or wires. In the Prologue, fairies seem to alight on a tower balcony from the air, a concept undercut later, when peasant lasses arrive for the Garland Waltz in lifts. The Garland Waltz itself is an attractive, but small-scale effort featuring two youngsters. Carabosse appears after a glowing petard falls from the sky and explodes with hisses of escaping gas. Pulling an arrow from a stag and additionally drinking magic waters, the Prince cannot help but see a vision of Aurora's castle revealed like a watermark in the backdrop. That's all good fun, but beside the point. More significantly, despite inconsistencies in the women's ports de bras, the company dances well. Veronika Part is probably miscast as Aurora. Giselle would be her apotheosis. Yet "The Sleeping Beauty" is full of plum roles, and has drawn magnificent work from all the principals, a variety of soloists and plucky corps members. ABT's dancers need "The Sleeping Beauty" to complete themselves as artists -- it's that important. For their sake, even a flawed "Beauty" is better than none.

While the jury was on one of many recesses (they sent a note to the judge saying they were bored by the relentless, gruesome testimony and needed extra breaks) the judge denied frequent requests by the defense to ask Pena whether Lana Clarkson could have committed suicide. The judge argued that if the defense wanted to ask Pena about suicide, the prosecution would be allowed to call Phil Spector as a witness. Now the defense&#8217;s suicide theory is more or less supported solely by a collection of melodramatic autobiographical stories Clarkson wrote in a creative writing class. IS THIS GOOD OR BAD FOR PHIL? Catastrophic. At this point, nobody is buying the defenseâs suicide theory. HAIR AND WARDROBE UPDATE: Spector wore a pale blue, large-collared shirt with a pinstriped jacket. His hair is the same shade of hot yellow itâs been for a long time now.

But then Jeff Zucker canned Kevin Reilly, hired hit-producer Ben Silverman, managed to grease Katherine Pope&#8217;s wheels well enough that she&#8217;s not leaving! In fact, Pope &ndash; the hottie (a qualification for women at this level of senior management) who was in charge of development at the network and who was gunning for Silverman&#8217;s current gig as entertainment chief &ndash; is now best buds with Silverman, at least according to the way . Oh, and she&#8217;s also been bumped up to lead NBC Universal Television Studio&#8217;s day-to-day. As for Pope, the well-regarded exec widely credited with playing a key role in the development of Peacock hit &#8220;Heroes&#8221; has been the frontrunner for the studio gig since last Tuesday. That&#8217;s when NBC U TV Studio co-chair Marc Graboff &#8212; and NBC U prexy-CEO Jeff Zucker &#8212; made it clear they wanted Pope to remain with the company. Silverman then came onboard with the idea after a series of getting-to-know-you phone calls and a two-hour meeting with Pope at NBC&#8217;s Burbank HQ last week. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always admired the work of Katherine Pope,&#8221; Silverman said. &#8220;She is an unbelievable executive.&#8221; [&#8230;] Pope &#8212; who&#8217;s been at NBC in either a studio or network gig since 2000 &#8212; said Silverman had &#8220;bowled me over&#8221; in their few meetings. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just his enthusiasm, which we all know about, but his absolute specificity in vision, his decisiveness and his ability to give clarity on what he wants.&#8221; Also, he promised not to leak internal arguments to the press when Pope&#8217;s on her &#8220;mensies.&#8221; &raquo; Post A Comment To Catch A Predator Caught In Its Own Web Of Lies"> To Catch A Predator Caught In Its Own Web Of Lies Reilly Out, Silverman in at NBC Nightly News May Sweeps Report Stone Phillips Loses Fat NBC Payday There are no comments yet.

Producer Ben Silverman, with his flair for exuberant salesmanship and half-buttoned shirts, took the TV industry by storm last week in a whirlwind of executive upheaval at NBC. When the dust had settled, NBC Entertainment President Kevin Reilly was out; two other top executives (NBC Universal Television Studio President Angela Bromstad and drama development head Katherine Pope) were in career limbo; and the producer of "The Office" was suddenly perched atop the NBC Entertainment hierarchy&mdash;named co-chair of NBC Entertainment and NUTS along with veteran executive Marc Graboff. In a Q&A with , Mr. Silverman revealed his courtship was so insanely rapid that he was hired and put on a media parade without having seen NBC's biggest fall pilots. Although the tenure of Mr. Reilly was marked by reports of clashes with his bosses, Mr. Silverman declared he will have no problems getting his preferred shows on the air. He explained why he would never order a show like "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip," but would greenlight a program that embraced "peace, love and understanding." And after the news of his hire leaked online last week, don't even get him started on bloggers. An edited transcript follows. What are your goals for NBC? To continue the great legacy of NBC and its unbelievable quality of programming. To be the No. 1 network. To be the absolute biggest and best brand in broadcast television. And more important, to be the most lucrative network. Specifically, how will you run things differently? You absolutely have to coordinate online with broadcast. There are opportunities to monetize and create assets in the digital world off of what you were doing in broadcast, and, in reverse, the digital world can become a greenhouse for you feeding your broadcast world. Also, you need to bring the studio into the fold. Mr. Reilly was often portrayed as being hamstrung, to some extent, about what he could get done. Have you been given any reassurances in terms of the leeway you'll have compared to the previous administration? You've met me in my office at [production house] Reveille. Can you imagine me hamstrung? I am not concerned at all. I can't characterize what existed previously, but I can only speak to&mdash;not just the assurances mdash;but the reality of who I am. I'm here to do this job. And I really don't have time for anything like that. Mr. Graboff said you're soon going to be looking to add some shows to the midseason schedule. Are you looking at projects developed under Mr. Reilly, or for new projects, or both? Both. Anywhere. I have no pride of ownership. I'm all about generating opportunity and hopefully inheriting some great work from Kevin and building on that with new ideas and fresh approaches. I have a ton of ideas I can't wait to bring to market. Creatively, what kind of projects should the community look to bring NBC at this point? I want to be aspirational. I want to be positive. I think people are so busy and overwhelmed in their lives and have so much choice, but also a cacophony exploding in their brain, and they look to television to disengage from that. I want to create environments that are warm and places they want to be&mdash;whether funny places or happy places or aspirational places. I want to lighten up the air. I also want to be pro-social and conscious and deliver through humor, character and narrative strong emotional connection. I want to find quality that has inherent touchpoints that could make it mass. I wouldn't make shows about Hollywood. There's just certain things I wouldn't do based on my knowledge of them being too coastal. What's your take on the pilots and fall schedule? I have not seen all the pilots yet. I thought Zach Levi, the star of "Chuck," was phenomenal and really fun, and that show had the kind of environment I want to be in. I always loved "The Bionic Woman" growing up and eagerly await seeing her powers come to fruition, but have not watched it yet. And I'm excited to see "Journeyman," which I hear is phenomenal from everyone I know who has seen it. I'm sure we're going to get some hits out of them. Donald Trump told CNN that NBC wants more "Apprentice." Does NBC want more "Apprentice"? I can't wait to talk to Donald Trump. I'm a big fan of Mark Burnett. &#x2026; We produced "The Restaurant" together. I can't wait to further my dialog with Mark and talk to Mr. Trump about what his vision for that would look like. Last Friday through Tuesday, after the news of your hire broke online and all the rumors were flying around, what was that like for you? Hell. It sucked. I hate the blog world. I like intimate, strong, detailed, good reporting. My poor mother sitting in the Hamptons&mdash;and all her buddies reading about my private plane that she's never been on. And I've never been on a private plane! It ends up interfering with people's lives. It ended up forcing decisions in a way that you would never want to force. It messes with the process. Privacy has been lost in the digital age, as well as any time to absorb or think about any message being communicated. Jeff Zucker has said he expects Katherine Pope to be at the network for a long time, but also said it's up to you to create your own team. As a producer, I assume you've worked with Ms. Pope. What's your impression of her? She's a good executive. I'm looking forward to getting to know this team and figure out who inside this team has the goods. I'm eager to replicate the culture I had at Reveille&mdash;which was loyal, fun and exciting. NBC and ABC have been the two most active networks in creating online content. What would you add to that? I have two great success stories with NBC online. We did unbelievably well-received and award-winning extensions of "The Office," including webisodes and brand extensions. With "Biggest Loser," in addition to the subscription Web service we created out of the show, which generated millions of dollars a year in revenue for the network and Reveille, we created a game that was created alongside the game in the television show &#x2026; and built a community around those contestants. Those sites, along with "Heroes" and "Deal or No Deal," have been the two most robust sites for NBC.com. You mentioned bringing the studio into the fold. What's your take on whether the studio should be kept separate? It should be separate. We're a creative hub. The network has certain needs that creative people inside the studio should be able to fill. But there are ideas, the creative, they may have that might be appropriate for other networks. We're a buyer and a seller. When we spoke a few months ago, you said your ultimate goal was entering public service. Is that still the case? Beyond. &#x2026; This is a company that's pioneering in the environmental field, pioneering on a global basis the solutions to major issues, and doing it in the great spirit of the capitalist democracy. Part of the appeal was that this enables me to reach more people and create more product to push more conversations about peace, love and understanding. Kevin Reilly: Hits and Misses NBC Entertainment President Kevin Reilly was replaced last week after three seasons programming the network. In the end, the hits he engineered didn't outweigh the misses that kept NBC from emerging from the ratings cellar. "Heroes": The hit that some say should have saved Mr. Reilly, "Heroes" is a complicated, big-budget, serialized show that debuted alongside a host of other complicated, big-budget, serialized shows last fall. Yet "Heroes" stood out and became the top-rated breakout drama of the season. "The Office": During its initial five-episode run, "The Office" averaged an anemic 2.5 rating among adults 18 to 49, lower than "30 Rock" this year. Yet Mr. Reilly stuck with the show (executive produced, ironically, by his successor, Ben Silverman), which has since blossomed into a critical hit and relatively strong performer. "Deal or No Deal": Game shows were pass&eacute; in prime time for several years following the burnout of "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire," but "Deal" became an instant hit when it premiered in 2005 and spawned several imitators. "Deal" has since helped NBC to fill scheduling gaps with a reliable ratings driver. "Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip": Far from the lowest-rated performer during the Reilly era, "Studio 60" nonetheless became an albatross around his neck, symbolizing industry complaints about NBC's most recent season&mdash;expensive, critic-pleasing projects that don't draw enough viewers. "Surface": Like "Studio 60," not the least-popular effort, but this 2005 title was dismissed as NBC's pricey me-too attempt to jump on the "Lost" bandwagon. "Grease: You're the One That I Want": NBC successfully revived Sunday nights last fall with football, then fumbled passing viewers to replacement programming in January, headed by this reality effort, which was paired with "The Apprentice."

Buy a link here Out of the mouths of big-toothed 'Creatures' Posted: June 1, 2007 With conventional sitcoms fumbling and floundering, it's refreshing - and too rare - for network TV to try a different kind of funny. "Creature Comforts," where have you been? Actually, if you get BBC America on satellite or digital cable, you know where this animated treat has been: on British TV, where the voices of typical blokes and birds in the street have issued from the mouths of whimsical animals for years. And if you've seen "Wallace & Gromit in The Curse of the Were-Rabbit" or "Chicken Run," you're familiar with the work of Nick Park's Aardman Animations, which produces both the British and American versions of "Creature Comforts." The distinctive Aardman style of stop-motion animation uses claylike figures in the shapes of all manner of creatures, from floppy-eared rabbits to garrulous goldfish. Apart from chattiness, what they all have in common is toothiness: Even the chickens sport sizable choppers.
