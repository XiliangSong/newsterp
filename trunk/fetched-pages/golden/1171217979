Max Baucus: The AP Interview Mark Foley Scandal Timeline Harry Reid Land Deal Congressional Leadership Financial Disclosure Harry Reid's Ties to Abramoff DeLay and Blunt: Following the Money Congress Goes to Bat for Tribes Plan Vote on Stem Cell Research intends to send President Bush legislation next week to ease restrictions on federally funded embryonic stem cell research, inviting his second veto in as many years on the subject. As was the case last year, Bush appears likely to make his veto stick. Several Democratic officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Wednesday that supporters of the bill appear to lack the two-thirds majority needed to override him. Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., a leading advocate of the legislation, did not dispute that assessment in an interview. "If he does veto it again it will just show his complete unwillingness to look at this research that holds the potential for cure of these diseases," she said. Both houses passed legislation on the subject earlier in the year. The final vote is expected Thursday in the House. Public opinion polls show strong support for the research, and it could return as an issue in the 2008 elections. Supporters of the research say it holds great promise in the quest for treatments of Alzheimer's and other illnesses. Critics counter that it is immoral because it involves the destruction of human embryos. In threatening a veto this year Bush said it "crossed a moral line that I and many others find troubling." There was no federal money for the work until Bush announced on Aug. 9, 2001, that his administration would make it available for lines of stem cells that were in existence. Elected with the strong support of abortion foes and other conservatives, he said at the time his decision was designed to balance concerns about "protecting life and improving life." He also limited the funds to cell lines derived from embryos that were surplus at fertility clinics, and that had been donated from adults who had given informed consent. Bush vetoed legislation to allow funding of additional lines of embryonic stem cells last year when it passed over the objections of Republicans then in control. Democrats made the legislation a top priority when they took control of the House and Senate in January. The House approved an initial measure within days of convening on a 253-174 vote was short of a veto-proof majority. The Senate passed a slightly different measure in April, 63-34, a margin that suggested supporters were one vote short of two-thirds. DeGette said the change inserted into the bill in the Senate encourages the federal government to conduct research into alternative therapies.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/B/BUSH?SITE=IACED&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Bush Calls for Global Emissions Goals AP White House Correspondent Bush Asks for Global Emission Goals by 2008 Latest White House Headlines Bush Calls for Global Emissions Goals Bush Sees South Korea Model for Iraq Bush Raises $675,000 for the NJ GOP Bush, Putin Plan July Meeting in Maine Bush Taps Zoellick to Lead World Bank Bush, seeking to blunt international criticism of the U.S. record on climate change, on Thursday urged 15 major nations to agree by the end of next year on a global emissions goal for reducing greenhouse gases. Bush called for the first in a series of meetings to begin this fall, bringing together countries identified as major emitters of greenhouse gases blamed for global warming. The list would include the United States, China, India and major European countries. The president outlined his proposal in a speech ahead of next week's summit in Germany of leading industrialized nations, where global warming is to be a major topic and Bush will be on the spot. The United States has refused to ratify the landmark 1997 Kyoto Protocol requiring industrialized countries to reduce greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by 2012. Developing countries, including China and India, were exempted from that first round of cuts. Bush rejected the Kyoto approach, as well as the latest German proposal for what happens after 2012. "The United States takes this issue seriously," Bush said. "The new initiative I'm outlining today will contribute to the important dialogue that will take place in Germany next week." Along with his call for a global emissions goal, Bush urged other nations to eliminate tariffs on clean energy technologies. Germany, which holds the European Union and Group of Eight presidencies, is proposing a so-called "2-degree" target, whereby global temperatures would be allowed to increase no more than 2 degrees Celsius - the equivalent of 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit - before being brought back down. Practically, experts have said that means a global reduction in emissions of 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. Instead, Bush called for nations to hold a series of meetings, beginning this fall, to set a global emissions goal. Each nation then would have to decide on how to achieve the goal, White House officials said. "The United States will work with other nations to establish a new framework for greenhouse gas emissions for when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012," the president said. "So my proposal is this: By the end of next year, America and other nations will set a long-term global goal for reducing greenhouse gases. To develop this goal, the United States will convene a series of meetings of nations that produce the most greenhouse gasses, including nations with rapidly growing economies like India and China. "Each country would establish midterm management targets and programs that reflect their own mix of energy sources and future energy needs," he said. "In the course of the next 18 months, our nations will bring together industry leaders from different sectors of our economies, such as power generation, and alternative fuels and transportation." Bush's critics were quick to respond, even before the president's speech had concluded. Daniel J. Weiss, climate strategy director for the liberal Center for American Progress, said the Bush administration has a "do-nothing" policy on global warming despite U.S. allies' best efforts to spur U.S. reductions. "Our allies' pleas for action add to the voices of many big corporations such as Dow, Shell, General Electric, and General Motors," Weiss said. "These and other Fortune 500 companies endorsed a 60 percent to 80 percent reduction in global warming pollution by 2050, the level scientists indicate that we must reach to stave off the worst impacts. Unfortunately, these appeals from his foreign and corporate allies continue to fall on President Bush's deaf ears." The U.S. last year actually experienced a drop in emissions of carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping gas most blamed for global warming. The 1.3 percent decline from 2005, the first drop in 11 years, was due to a mild winter followed by a cool summer. Carbon dioxide is produced from burning fossil fuels, including natural gas and coal, which are used widely to produce electricity to heat homes in winter and run air conditioners in summer. While Bush announced his new proposal, the administration registered its opposition to a number of approaches to combat global warming. Specifically, the White House said it does not support a global carbon-trading program allowing countries to buy and sell carbon credits to meet limits on carbon dioxide levels. The White House also expressed opposition to energy efficiency targets advocated by the EU, arguing that a standard applicable in one country does not fit another.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CALIFORNIA_2008_CANDIDATES?SITE=IACED&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Presidential Hopefuls Campaign in Calif. AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez Global Warming? Gay Marriage? See Where the Candidates Stand BURLINGAME, Calif. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidate Rudy Giuliani on Wednesday declared that California's early primary has made the state more than a political ATM - just as he accepted a check from a supporter and then headed to two fundraisers. California's Feb. 5 presidential primary seemed to be having a modest effect, with several major candidates blending their fundraising chores with campaign stops to greet potential voters. Mostly, however, the focus was on fundraising. Democrats John Edwards and Hillary Rodham Clinton also trolled the nation's most delegate-rich state for cash and votes Wednesday. Between them, the three candidates held six California money events. Edwards, during an appearance between the four fundraisers he is holding over two days, decried the influence of money on politics and called for public financing of campaigns. "I'm not holier-than-thou about this. I've raised millions of dollars in 2004 and now to run for president," he added. "But that doesn't mean I think the system is good, because I don't." Giuliani stepped off a plane at San Francisco International Airport and promptly went to the Broadway Grill a few minutes away to chat with customers. His campaign ensured the lunchtime visit was stacked with supporters, sending out an e-mail Wednesday morning urging them to stop by the cafe en route to the fundraiser. Those crowded into the restaurant appeared to be a mix of regulars in T-shirts and committed supporters clad in suits and ties and bound for the fundraiser, which cost $250 and up. George Yerby handed the candidate a check for $200 on the spot. Giuliani hastily passed it to an aide. "He's going to be the next president," Yerby, 67, who lives in the wealthy Bay area enclave of Hillsborough, said afterward. "I hope." Giuliani closed his fundraisers here and in Beverly Hills to the public and news media. The restaurant stop, where he sipped orange juice and coffee, was open. He acknowledged to reporters outside the grill that raising money "has always been a big focus in California, like it was in New York." "One of the complaints that New Yorkers have had, and that Californians have had, is 'They come here, they take our money, but they don't campaign here.'," he said. "So now, they're going to get both - they're going to get us coming here and trying to get your money, but also coming here and campaigning." California is one of 15 states to move its primary to Feb. 5, and others are considering it. Its primary for state candidates will remain in June 2008. Giuliani promised to return regularly if he captures the GOP presidential nomination. "I think I'm the one Republican candidate who has a legitimate chance of winning California. That's based on the polls," he said. A Field Poll of California voters in March suggested otherwise. It showed GOP rival Sen. John McCain running stronger against Edwards and Clinton in hypothetical head-to-head matchups. McCain and Giuliani trailed Democratic candidate Barack Obama by identical margins, and also were behind Clinton and Edwards. Edwards headlined a fundraiser in San Francisco on Wednesday, headed to a second one Wednesday evening in the Bay area suburb of Atherton and planned two more Thursday. During an appearance at the headquarters of search-engine leader Google, Edwards said the current system of paying for campaigns is "dysfunctional." "The way we finance political campaigns in this country, it couldn't be more unhealthy," Edwards told about 1,000 Google employees. He called for taxpayer-financed campaigns - the only way, he said, to "literally pull the life out of these big groups - people that have a huge presence in Washington, lobbying groups." The former senator from North Carolina was the fourth presidential candidate to submit to questioning by executives and staffers of Google. Clinton, meanwhile, held two fundraisers in the Los Angeles area, one hosted by director Steven Spielberg.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/F/FRED_THOMPSON?SITE=IACED&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT 11:47 PM EDT Thompson Moves Toward White House Bid Actor Thompson Inches Toward White House Bid Thompson, the former Tennessee senator and "Law & Order" actor, is taking significant steps toward an expected summer entry into the crowded but extraordinarily unsettled Republican presidential race. His likely candidacy could give restless conservatives somewhere to turn. A crucial bloc of the GOP, those voters have not fully embraced the leading contenders, giving Thompson what his backers argue is an opening for a "true conservative" who can triumph in November 2008. The 64-year-old Southerner would bring a right-leaning Senate voting record with a few digressions from GOP orthd odoxy and a dash of Hollywood star power given his many movie roles and TV stint as the gruff district attorney on NBC's popular crime drama. On Wednesday, Thompson asked to be released from his role of playing a prosecutor on the TV series "Law & Order." The show's executive producer, Dick Wolf, said Thompson told him he "has not made a firm decision about his political future" but that he was concerned about "the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season." A Thompson bid also could make the contest to succeed President Bush even more topsy turvy; all three top-tier candidates - Rudy Giuliani, John McCain and Mitt Romney - could lose some measure of support and the seven underdogs could become even more irrelevant. Thompson will make his first formal campaign move in the coming days, establishing an official organization to weigh a White House bid while launching a major fundraising drive on Monday, according to several Republicans with knowledge of his plans. Speaking on condition of anonymity because the timeline is not public, these officials said Thompson may visit early primary states in late June and could officially enter the race as early as the first week in July. "Senator Thompson is still seriously considering getting into the presidential contest and he is doing everything he has to do to make that final decision," said Mark Corallo, a Thompson spokesman. "Stay tuned." On Thompson's schedule in the coming weeks: a speech to Virginia Republicans in Richmond on Saturday and an appearance with Jay Leno on "The Tonight Show" on June 12. One official said an overseas trip also may be in the works. For months, Thompson has openly flirted with a candidacy as a Tennessee-based effort sought to draft him into the race. He made several high-profile moves that pointed to a bid, not the least of which was disclosing that he is in remission after being diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer. His popularity in national polls spiked to double digits early in the year, but while he still fares well in surveys, his numbers have fallen following what some Republicans considered a subpar speech in early May in California. That's prompted some rumblings in GOP circles that Thompson may have missed his opportunity to make a splash in the race. Undaunted, Thompson has been casting himself as a straight-talking conservative in the mold of former President Reagan in speeches and on the Internet. "He's not Ronald Reagan, but he's Reaganesque," said Ted Malloch of Palm Beach, Fla., the chief executive of a consulting firm who is supporting Thompson. "Fred is unique in the sense that all the boxes have been checked." During his 1994-2002 Senate tenure, he was considered a reliably conservative vote. He worked to limit the role of the federal government and backed a ban on a late-term abortion procedure. He voted in favor of Bush's tax cuts, oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, eliminating money for the National Endowment for the Arts and a constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. And, he voted against requiring criminal background checks for purchases at gun shows. But he sometimes took paths that didn't necessarily sit well with conservatives, including advocating for campaign finance reform. While he voted to oust President Clinton from office, he also was one of 10 Republican senators who voted against one of the two impeachment charges. Social issues, important to the party's right, also typically weren't at the top of his agenda. He was known less as a legislator and more as an investigator, leading the committee that examined former President Clinton's fundraising in 1996. Yet, he established a reputation as a less-than-hard worker. The Democratic National Committee issued a research document Wednesday detailing Thompson's major legislative accomplishments. Save for the title and a DNC disclaimer, it was blank. Thompson was one of the few senators who backed underdog McCain in 2000 over George W. Bush, the establishment candidate. This time around, Thompson would be opposing McCain - and could hurt his friend's own shot at the White House. The two have similar Senate records but Thompson could be seen as a fresher face to McCain, who is well-known to GOP voters. Romney, who is trying to position himself to the right of the major candidates, also could see his support fall among conservatives concerned about his shifts on issues. Campaigning in Iowa, Romney said he welcomed a Thompson entry. "I think he'll make the race more interesting. He's got good ideas and after all, he does put bad people in jail every week on 'Law & Order,'" he said. Giuliani could be hindered as well if Thompson grabs the attention of Republicans uneasy with the former New York City mayor's support for gay and abortion rights. Campaigning in California, Giuliani said he would welcome Thompson, but argued that he was the stronger candidate based on his record of cutting taxes and combatting terrorism as well as his ability to win a general election. Ticking off states that went Democratic in 2004, such as California and New York, Giuliani said, "Those are all states Republicans gave away in the past and the Democrats took for granted. ... It doesn't mean I'll win all of them, but if I win my fair share of them, then I'll get elected." Over the next few days, Thompson plans to form a "testing the waters" committee called "Friends of Fred Thompson," which will allow him to begin raising money, hire staff and gauge support without officially committing to a White House bid. He could significantly dampen the fundraising ability of his potential GOP rivals during the homestretch of the second quarter financial reporting period. "It's going to cause everybody to have second thoughts about writing a check," said Scott Reed, a Republican strategist who is unaligned in the race. Thompson spoke on a conference call Wednesday to several dozen people who officials called "First Day Founders" and said committed to raising money for him. Participants said they were asked to raise $46,000 apiece, the $2,300 maximum from 10 couples or 20 people. Officials cautioned that Thompson has made no final decision.

See Where the Candidates Stand presidential candidates Bill Richardson and Chris Dodd will not participate in a Democratic debate co-sponsored by Fox News Channel this fall, joining their three top rivals in bypassing the event. Their decisions, acknowledged by campaign aides Wednesday, is sure to disappoint the Congressional Black Caucus, whose political education and leadership institute is Fox's partner in the debate. But Richardson, the governor of New Mexico, and Dodd, a senator from Connecticut, have been under pressure to shun the debate from liberal groups who say Fox is biased against Democrats. The debate exodus began two months ago when John Edwards became the first candidate to announce that he would not attend the Sept. 23 debate in Detroit. A week later, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama announced they also would not participate. Sen. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, have said they intend to be at the debate. Several campaigns have agonized over the decision, especially because of the participation of the Congressional Black Caucus, the group that comprises Congress' black lawmakers, including Obama. But Colorofchange.org, an organization of black online activists, and the liberal MoveOn.org have agitated against Fox with an Internet campaign that includes video excerpts of conservative Fox commentators. MoveOn this week initiated an e-mail campaign urging backers to call Biden's campaign to demand he back out of the debate. "The Congressional Black Caucus represents an important base within the Democratic Party," Biden campaign manager Luis Navarro said. "We think Democratic candidates ought to be willing to respect that." The caucus is co-sponsoring another Democratic debate with CNN in January. No one has indicated they will miss that one. Meanwhile, the Financial Times and the Center on Politics and Foreign Relations at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies have been trying to secure commitments from Democratic candidates to participate in a debate next week devoted exclusively to Iraq. Biden, who has been demanding a war-only debate, is the only one so far to say he will attend. Robert Guttman, the director of the center at Johns Hopkins said other campaigns have indicated interest and said some cable news organizations and public television have said they would cover the debate. It is scheduled for 7:30 p.m. EDT Wednesday's at Johns Hopkins' Kenney Auditorium. Guttman said he planned to place chairs on the stage for the candidates, whether they attended or not. "We're ready to roll, with full seats or empty seats," Guttman said. DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney on Wednesday repeated his call to add more troops, saying the Iraq war had left the nation's military seriously stressed. The former governor of Massachusetts said he supported President Bush's decision to intervene in Iraq, but conceded that the effort has had plenty of missteps. "I think we've made a number of mistakes," said Romney, opening a two-day campaign trip to Iowa by speaking to a business group. "We were underprepared for what developed. I don't think we had anywhere near enough troops." Romney said he supports adding at least 100,000 troops to the military. The idea of pulling American troops out of Iraq is "very tempting," Romney said, but doing so would lead to a larger conflict in the region. Romney said he was willing to give the president's plan of increasing troops in Iraq time to work, potentially as long as the end of the year. "If it's working we'll all celebrate that," said Romney. Romney was also asked about his effort as governor to broaden health coverage. He said the Massachusetts plan could serve as a model for the nation, but as president he would be reluctant to impose solutions on the states. "My inclination would be to let the states try their own plans," said Romney. "We're going to give them flexibility."

http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/H/HISPANICS_2008?SITE=IACED&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Endorsement Spotlights Hispanic Vote By MICHAEL R. BLOOD Global Warming? Gay Marriage? See Where the Candidates Stand LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton's political courtship of Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa landed her an early, influential endorsement this week that highlights the intense competition among presidential candidates for support within the growing Hispanic population. Candidates in both major parties are reaching out to Hispanic voters with an intensity that speaks to the importance of the nation's largest and fastest-growing minority group in the 2008 campaign. Republican Mitt Romney has hired a Spanish-language media adviser in Florida. Democrat Bill Richardson, whose mother is Mexican, has made overt appeals to Hispanic voters, including announcing his candidacy in English and Spanish. Sen. Barack Obama and John Edwards are among the candidates devoting parts of their Web sites to Spanish speakers. And next week, Sen. John McCain will travel to Miami to deliver a speech on immigration, a site chosen in part because of the city's large Hispanic population. "As we've seen in the last few elections, the Hispanic vote has become a critical ... part of the Republican coalition," said Romney aide Alex Burgos. With large Hispanic populations in early voting states like Florida, California and New York, "it takes on even more importance," he said. Hispanics tend to lean Democratic in national elections, but President Bush showed in 2004 that Republicans have much at stake. Bush captured about 40 percent of the Hispanic vote that year, the most ever for a GOP presidential candidate. His Democratic rival, John Kerry, won 53 percent, down from the 62 percent former Vice President Al Gore garnered in 2000. Villaraigosa, a potential gubernatorial candidate in 2010, is one of the nation's most recognized Hispanic politicians. He's expected to serve as a strong advocate for Clinton among Hispanics, particularly in vote-rich Southern California. California's Hispanic population is nearing 36 percent - more than double the U.S. average. However, Hispanics historically vote in numbers well below their share of the population, in part because many are either too young to vote, unregistered or foreign citizens. But as the Hispanic population increases in the state, so has voting participation. In 1992, Hispanics accounted for about 8 percent of Californians going to the polls; in 2006, the figure hit 14 percent, according to figures compiled by the Public Policy Institute of California. Their impact is strongest on the Democratic side of the ticket - one of every five party voters in the state is Hispanic. In the national midterm election in 2006, Democrats recaptured a large part of the Hispanic vote - nearly seven in 10 Hispanic voters supported Democratic congressional candidates, exit polls found. But Republicans in several key states also did well, suggesting Latinos could be important swing voters in 2008. Hispanics could play important roles in potential battleground states like Nevada, Colorado and Arizona, which have large Latino populations. In California "the increasing proportion of Latino adults, greater rates of citizenship and increasing social mobility are all leading to higher proportions of Latinos turning out at the polls," said Public Policy Institute pollster Mark Baldassare. For "Democratic candidates to win, they will need to do well among Latino voters," he added. Not surprisingly, Villaraigosa's endorsement Wednesday was eagerly sought by all the leading Democratic candidates. Clinton landed the nod after a series of phone calls and meetings, which included a New York City dinner between the mayor and former President Bill Clinton. The senator earlier hired a Villaraigosa political adviser to run her California campaign and named state Assembly Speaker Fabian Nunez, a close friend of the mayor and another prominent Hispanic politician, a national co-chair of her campaign. She also appointed Villaraigosa a national co-chair.

Take a State-by-State Look SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Democratic presidential hopeful John Edwards says a wave of mergers in the oil industry should be investigated by the Justice Department to see what impact they have had on soaring gasoline prices. During a planned campaign stop Thursday in Silicon Valley, Edwards planned to berate the oil industry for "anticompetitive actions" and outline an energy plan he says would reduce oil imports "and get us on a path to be virtually petroleum-free within a generation." "Vertically integrated companies like Exxon Mobil own every step of the production process - from extraction to refining to sale at the pump, enabling them to foreclose competition," says an outline of Edward's energy plan provided to The Associated Press by his campaign. Edwards' call for a major shift away from oil use would include, according to the document: - An increase of federal auto fuel economy requirements to 45 miles per gallon from the current 27.5 mpg by 2016. - Expansion of the use of biofuels such as ethanol, including a requirement for oil companies to make available E-85 fuel (which has 85 percent ethanol) at a quarter of their stations. Edwards wants all new cars to be able to use E-85 by 2010. - Mandatory restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide with an aim to cut CO2 and other greenhouse gases by 80 percent by mid-century. - Creation of a $13 billion energy fund from the sale of greenhouse gas permits and ending some tax breaks for the oil industry. The money would be used to support biofuels and conservation technologies. Many of Edwards' proposals - from cutting greenhouse gas emissions to investigating oil industry consolidation - have been the subject of numerous hearings in Congress this years, as has calls by Democrats to make automobiles more fuel efficient. Rival Democratic presidential candidates, including Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, also have called for expanded use of ethanol and other measures to reduce the country's reliance on oil. But Edwards' message may resonate especially in California, the nation's most delegate-rich state, which has perennially high gasoline prices. On Wednesday, the average regular-grade gasoline in California was $3.41 per gallon, according to the AAA Daily Fuel Gauge Report. The national average was $3.20 per gallon, compared to $2.85 a year ago. But Tupper Hull, spokesman for the Sacramento-based Western States Petroleum Association, said the prices reflected market rates, and an antitrust investigation would be a waste of time. He said the industry has been the subject of more than 20 state and federal investigations over the past two decades.

The comparison was offered as the Pentagon announced the completion of the troop buildup ordered by Bush in January. The last of about 21,500 combat troops to arrive were an Army brigade in Baghdad and a Marine unit heading into the Anbar province in western Iraq. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said there are now 20 combat brigades in Iraq, up from 15 when the buildup began. A brigade is roughly 3,500 troops. Overall, the Pentagon said there are 150,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. That number may still climb as more support troops move in. The administration warns that the buildup will result in more U.S. casualties as more American soldiers come into contact with enemy forces. May already is the third bloodiest month since the war began in March 2003. As of late Tuesday, there were 116 U.S. deaths in Iraq so far in May - trailing only the 137 in November 2004 and the 135 in April 2004. Overall, more than 3,460 U.S. service members have died. Presidential spokesman Tony Snow said Bush has cited the long-term Korea analogy in looking at the U.S. role in Iraq, where American forces are in the fifth year of an unpopular war. Bush's goal is for Iraqi forces to take over the chief security responsibilities, relieving U.S. forces of frontline combat duty, Snow said. "I think the point he's trying to make is that the situation in Iraq, and indeed, the larger war on terror, are things that are going to take a long time," Snow said. "But it is not always going to require an up-front combat presence." Instead, he said, U.S. troops would provide "the so-called over-the-horizon support that is necessary from time to time to come to the assistance of the Iraqis. But you do not want the United States forever in the front." The comparison with South Korea paints a picture of a lengthy U.S. commitment at a time when Americans have grown weary of the Iraq war and want U.S. troops to start coming home. Bush vetoed legislation that would set timetables for U.S. troop withdrawals, and forced Congress to approve a new bill stripped of troop pullout language. Asked if U.S. forces would be permanently stationed in Iraq, Snow said, "No, not necessarily." He said that the prospect of permanent U.S. bases in Iraq were "not necessarily the case, either." Later, Snow said it was impossible to say if U.S. troops would remain in Iraq for some 50 years, as they have in South Korea. "I don't know," he said. "It is an unanswerable question. But I'm not making that suggestion. ... The war on terror is a long war." South Korea is just one example of U.S. troops stationed more than a half-century after war. Germany and Japan are two other examples. American forces are deployed in roughly 130 countries around the world, performing a variety of duties from combat to peacekeeping to training foreign militaries, according to GlobalSecurity.org, a defense-oriented think tank. In South Korea, about 29,500 U.S. troops are stationed as a deterrent against the communist North, but that number is to decline to 24,500 by 2008 as part of the Pentagon's worldwide realignment of its forces. The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950-53 Korean War ended in a cease-fire, not a peace treaty. Adm. William Fallon, the top U.S. commander in the Middle East, seemed a surprising choice when he got the job earlier this year, yet his experience as U.S. commander in the Pacific overseeing the Korean peninsula would serve him well if the U.S. military adopts a Korea model in Iraq. AP writer Lolita C. Baldor contributed to this report from the Pentagon.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/P/POLITICAL_POLARIZATION?SITE=IACED&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Iraq, Immigration Polarize 2008 Field and Democratic presidential candidates are abandoning the middle ground for positions on Iraq and immigration that cater to their parties' fringes - the latest example of polarization trumping moderation in Washington. Democrats are lurching to the left on Iraq. Republicans are moving right on immigration. Neither shift is a surprise; the two-party system encourages presidential candidates to appeal to each side's most fervent voters during the nomination fights. But two things make this cycle special: - The early start to the 2008 campaign means that White House hopefuls will be listening longer than usual to their parties' "base" voters before having to worry about what the rest of the electorate thinks. - National political leaders are more polarized than they've been in decades. "It surely doesn't bode well for reconciliation or trying to forge a consensus on these two very important topics," said David L. Epstein, an expert on political polarization at Columbia University. "The worry is that things are just going to become more polarized as times goes on and it's going to be harder and harder for whoever wins to govern." On Iraq, four of the leading Democratic candidates cast Senate votes in 2002 to give President Bush the authority to wage war. At the time, Bush's approval ratings were high and Democratic consultants warned their clients against looking weak in the war on terror by standing up to the White House. As the U.S. casualty totals in Iraq climbed, the liberal wing of the party galvanized anti-war sentiment via the Internet and applied pressure on Democratic leaders to defy Bush. To differing degrees, Democratic presidential candidates distanced themselves from their votes and the war - most notably the front-runner, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton. In 2002, the New York senator was one of the more hawkish Democrats in Congress. She not only warned that Saddam Hussein was rebuilding his weapons of mass destruction program, but also accused the Iraqi leader of giving "aid, comfort and sanctuary to terrorists, including al-Qaida members, though there is apparently no evidence of his involvement in the terrible events of Sept. 11, 2001." Like the White House, she was wrong about Saddam's weapons and ties to al-Qaida. Even as Clinton started to question the president's integrity and competence regarding the war, she often echoed his rhetoric. "Failure is not an option," she said in December 2003 about Iraq and Afghanistan. "We have no option but to stay involved and committed." Her position became politically untenable when freshman Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois entered the race, burnishing his record of opposing the war from the start. Under pressure, Clinton and Obama tacked to the left in recent weeks - first opposing deadlines for U.S. troop withdrawal, then reversing course last week to vote against funding the war. On immigration, the GOP's top tier is filled with candidates who previously supported immigrant rights in general or, specifically, backed giving illegal immigrants a route to citizenship: Sen. John McCain of Arizona, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and former Sen. Fred Thompson. Only McCain has stood by his views. The others fell in line behind the anti-immigration GOP base to oppose a compromise bill forged by the White House and Democratic lawmakers. Thompson went so far as to say the United States is "beset by people who are suicidal maniacs and want to kill countless innocent men, women and children around the world" - an inflammatory charge that he didn't even try to substantiate. The positioning on Iraq and immigration is part of a broader trend toward polarization in Washington, which some experts believe is more pronounced than any time since the late 1800s. The factors contributing to polarization today are similar to those from a century or so ago. They include: - New technologies that democratize communications (the telegraph then, and the Internet now). - Clusters of emotional issues that tend to divide people (trust-busting, civil rights and immigration then; abortion, gay rights and immigration now). - More sophisticated political strategies (peer-to-peer persuasion on the precinct level then; microtargeting and high-tech redistricting now). "The bases are much more clearly defined from one another than they've been since maybe the turn of the last century," said Marc J. Hetherington, an associate professor of political science at Vanderbilt University who is writing a book on polarization called "Divided We Stand." Still, the nation's political leaders are generally more divided than the people they represent - on Iraq, immigration and other issues. "It makes it very difficult to govern," Hetherington said. "It makes it really hard to get anything done." EDITOR'S NOTE - Ron Fournier has covered politics for The Associated Press for nearly 20 years.

Gay Marriage? See Where the Candidates Stand LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday that she followed all Senate rules when she accepted rides on a private jet from a longtime benefactor. "Whatever I've done, I complied with Senate rules at the time. That's the way every senator operates," the Democratic presidential contender said in an interview with The Associated Press during a campaign stop in Las Vegas. Clinton's travel, along with and consulting fees paid to her husband, the former president, have come to light recently in a lawsuit against Vinod Gupta, a Clinton contributor and chief executive of the data company, InfoUSA Inc. The lawsuit by company shareholders accuses Gupta of excessively spending millions of dollars, including $900,000 worth of travel on the Clintons. Sen. Clinton, who complained about corporate America's largesse and skyrocketing executive pay during campaign events Wednesday, said she did not believe her message was undermined by her acceptance of the private flights. In line with Senate rules then in effect, Clinton's campaign has said she reimbursed Gupta at the cost of a first-class flight, typically a significant discount off the expense of a private jet. "Those were the rules. You'll have to ask somebody else whether that's good policy," she said. The Senate earlier this year voted to change the rules to require senators, their staff and candidates for federal office to pay the charter rate for flights on corporate jets. All the presidential candidates serving in the Senate, including Clinton, voted for the change. Clinton struck several populist notes Wednesday in a speech at a union hall and at a town hall appearance at a North Las Vegas high school with large number of minority and low-income students. The senator told members of the Culinary Workers Union, a group that represents casino and hotel workers, that it should be made easier for unions to organize and that private equity firms should honor union contracts after buyouts. Both issues are important to the union, whose endorsement is considered key to winning Nevada's Jan. 19 caucus. The senator made light of her own personal wealth. "I know a lot of rich people. My husband and I never had any money ... now all (of a) ... sudden we're rich," Clinton said. "I have nothing against rich people. ... but what made America great is the American middle class." Clinton won her loudest applause with her promise to end the war in Iraq. In the AP interview, she defended her vote against an Iraq war funding bill, saying she believes that President Bush will begin withdrawing troops from Iraq soon and she doesn't want to back his strategy any longer. Clinton said she came to the conclusion while watching the president's Rose Garden news conference last week in which he referred to the bipartisan Iraq Study Group report. "He talked about it favorably for the first time I've ever heard him talk about it," Clinton said. "That was to me a big signal that starting in the fall and toward the end of the year we're going to start seeing troops withdrawn from Iraq. "My argument is, why wait?" Among other things, the Iraq Study Group warned against sending more troops for long stints in the war zone and initially called for withdrawal by early 2008. Clinton and her chief rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, voted against the funding bill last week in the face of strong pressure from liberal groups who wanted Democrats to use the bill to force a change of course. Clinton earlier supported a bill calling for a withdrawal timeline, which was vetoed by the president. Clinton initially opposed cutting off funding for the troops, but said Wednesday that she believed last week's vote was cast in support of soldiers abroad. "The best thing I can do to continue my very vigorous support of the troops is to begin to bring them home," she said. Clinton declined to comment on two unreleased biographies that, according to press accounts, describe the former first lady's road to her candidacy in unflattering terms. She said she wasn't familiar with the books. Clinton acknowledged an assertion reportedly contained in one of the books: that she did not read a National Intelligence Estimate before voting to authorize the president to go to war in Iraq. "I don't believe that I did or that vast majority of my colleagues did because we were briefed repeatedly about everything that was in it," she said. Later Wednesday in Los Angeles, Clinton toured a child-care center with Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who formally endorsed her campaign at a news conference. She was expected to raise $1 million at two Los Angeles-area fundraisers Wednesday night.
