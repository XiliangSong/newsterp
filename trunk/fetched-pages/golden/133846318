http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6708075.stm buys 27 new Boeing planes GMT 13:56 buys 27 new Boeing planes Passenger growth is expected to boost Ryanair results out next week Budget airline Ryanair has signed a deal to buy 27 737-800 planes from Boeing worth a possible $1.9bn (£960m). The aircraft will be delivered between 2009 and 2010, increasing the Irish carrier's total fleet to 262 by 2012. Ryanair said the planes would be fitted with technology to reduce fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions. Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has said in the past that "the recent hysteria" over the impact of flying on climate change is "misguided and misplaced". Mr O' Leary says aviation accounts for less than 1.6% of greenhouse gas emissions. In buying the environmentally-friendly 737-800, the group said it was "strengthening Ryanair's position as Europe's cheapest, greenest and cleanest airline". "Ryanair guarantees passengers that they will not find a cheaper fare with any other airline on any of its 487 routes," added Ryanair's chief financial officer Howard Millar. "The combination of the lowest per seat operating cost and the reliability of these Boeing 737 800s will benefit millions of additional passengers in the coming five years as we extend our route network and our guaranteed lowest fares." The fast-expanding no-frills airline, which is due to report its annual results next week, is waiting for the conclusion of a European Union investigation into whether its proposed takeover of rival Aer Lingus would hamper competition in the airline industry.

The world's second largest mobile phone-maker, US-based Motorola was already on target to complete 3,500 job reductions by the end of June. It forecasts the combined job losses and other cost-cutting moves will save the firm $600m (£304m) a year. Motorola has been losing market share to rivals amid tough price competition. Mobile phone analyst Lawrence Harris said Motorola was also handicapped by a weak range of phones. "The extra job cuts will certainly help them return to profitability but it's not enough to get them to the double digit profit margins they seek," he said. "They need exciting new products." Back in January, Motorola announced that its fourth quarter profits fell 48% to $624m. raises pressure on Motorola 01 to go in Motorola jobs cull 19 Jan alert prompts stock fall 05 Jan results hit Motorola shares 18 Oct in India contract battle 10 Oct buys barcode scan firm 19 Sep

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6706849.stm rise 'to cool house market' GMT 09:03 rise 'to cool house market' Nationwide warned buyers not to over-stretch themselves The latest rise in UK rates is set to cool housing activity, the Nationwide has said, although annual price growth remained "resilient" during May. Nationwide's latest survey said annual house price inflation stood at 10.3% in May after a 0.5% increase in the month. But the high inflation figure was mainly down to slower price growth a year ago, the building society said. It added the underlying trend was still slowing and warned buyers not to over-stretch themselves financially. "Higher interest rates, with the threat of more on the horizon, should signal caution to those thinking about stretching themselves to get a foot on the ladder," the society said. The price of an average house now stands at £181,584, Nationwide said. Earlier this month, the Bank of England raised UK interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point to 5.5% - the fourth rate rise since August last year. The Nationwide said this latest rise would cool both activity and price growth in the housing market. The 0.5% rise in house prices during May was down from April's increase of 0.9%. Meanwhile, the three-month on three-month growth rate - which is often seen as a good indicator of underlying trends - fell to 1.8% in May, its lowest level since August 2006. Nationwide said that it expected a further rise in interest rates to 5.75% later this year as the Bank of England sought to counter inflationary pressures. While higher rates "clearly present risks" to the housing market, Nationwide added that the sector should see a "measured cooling" as long as the economy remained in good shape. Nationwide said that the underlying picture for prices was showing "a clear downward trend as the effect of earlier increases in interest rates takes hold". Recently, there has been a drop-off in mortgage approvals and inquiries from new buyers to estate agents. But so far both the Nationwide survey, and those of other market commentators, have continued to show prices rising steadily with little obvious sign of a slowdown in the pace of increase. On Wednesday, the latest monthly survey from the English and Welsh Land Registry said prices rose twice as fast in April as they did a year ago. Analysts said that the lack of properties for sale would continue to support prices. "Despite slowing demand, house prices still seem likely to lose buoyancy only gradually as a general shortage of property means that pricing power is currently still in favour of the vendor," said Howard Archer, chief UK and European economist at Global Insight. "This is particularly true in London and the South East, where prices are being fuelled by elevated City bonuses and strong foreign demand, as well as an acute shortage of supply." home costs deter buyers Spain real estate sell-off eases House price growth 'strengthens' Cheapest homes top £100k Mortgage lending is still booming Will house prices crash?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6706979.stm lifts Indian growth GMT 08:17 lifts Indian growth Manufacturing, including the car sector, is fuelling the economy The Indian economy grew at an annual rate of 9.1% in the first three months of this year, driven by the strong manufacturing and service sectors. The economic growth was less than market expectations of a 9.4% expansion, but higher than the 8.7% recorded in the last quarter of 2006. Analysts now expect growth to slow slightly over the next year as the government aims to prevent overheating. Manufacturing and services both grew by 12.4% in the first quarter of 2007. Meanwhile, the construction industry expanded by 11.2%, while farming grew by just 3.8%. "The growth rate is clearly impressive and is a very good performance," said HSBC economist Robert Prior-Wandesforde. "But going forward there may be a softening in the growth cycle due to a recent spate of monetary tightening measures. "We expect 2007/08 growth at 7.8%." In March, India's central bank raised interest rates to 7.75% from 7.5%, its highest level in almost four-and-a-half years. It was the second rate rise in three months as the bank sought to rein in inflation fuelled by the fast-growing economy.

It is now up to his defence team to convince the jury he did not steal $60m (£30.4m) from Hollinger International. Without explanation, prosecutors have also dropped a single count of money laundering against Lord Black. He still faces 13 other charges including fraud and tax evasion, all of which he denies. In total he is now charged with nine counts of fraud, one of obstruction of justice, one of racketeering or running an organised crime, and two of tax evasion. If found guilty on all counts, Lord Black, 62, faces a jail sentence of up to 101 years. Nine counts of fraud One of obstruction of justice Two of tax evasion Federal prosecutors allege Lord Black Fraudulently received non-compete fees from the sale of Hollinger assets Deprived the company of his honest services Repeatedly benefited himself at the expense of the company and its public shareholders through the abuse of company perks Other executives on trial John Boultbee - former chief financial officer Peter Atkinson - former general counsel Mark Kipnis - former corporate counsel and secretary His three co-defendants, all former executives at newspaper firm Hollinger, face lesser charges. Lord Black and the three others are accused of enriching themselves at the expense of shareholders by pocketing payments made during the sale of hundreds of Hollinger's community newspapers. Lord Black is also accused of abusing corporate perks, such as using the company jet for personal reasons, and spending company funds on everything from a luxury Manhattan apartment to lavish birthday parties for his wife Barbara Amiel. The jury is expected to begin its deliberations in late June. Canadian-born Lord Black became a British citizen in 2001, enabling him to become a member of the House of Lords. Through Hollinger he took control of a number of well-known newspapers including the Daily Telegraph and Chicago Sun-Times. The Daily Telegraph has since been sold, and Hollinger has been renamed Sun-Times Media.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6707261.stm rise in German jobless GMT 10:24 rise in German jobless Strong economic growth has seen unemployment fall for 13 months The German unemployment total unexpectedly rose in May, breaking a run of 13 consecutive monthly falls. The adjusted jobless total increased to 3.855 million in May, up 3,000 on the previous month. The unemployment rate was unchanged at 9.2%, according to official figures from the Federal Labour Office. But economists said the rise in May was probably just a blip and that the jobless total would probably continue falling in the coming months. "It is not a major problem, just a temporary effect," said Ulrike Kastens at Sal. Oppenheim bank. Of more concern was the 4,000 fall in the number of vacancies to 601,000 in adjusted terms. "There is a slight worry in that job vacancies fell again, perhaps a further sign that the employment boom may be losing momentum," said David Brown at Bear Stearns International. "This is something that the European Central Bank must pay very careful attention to, a reminder that it cannot keep raising rates with impunity," he added. jobless dips below 4m mark 01 German growth hits six-year high 11 Jan business confidence soars 19 Dec trade surplus hits record 08 Dec jobless at four-year low 30 Nov still upbeat on economy 23 Nov

His nomination will be considered by the World Bank's 24-member board of governors, although the US nomination has always been accepted in the past. Mr Zoellick would replace Paul Wolfowitz, who steps down on 30 June. Some members have called for candidates from outside the United States to be considered for the job. Accepting the nomination, Mr Zoellick acknowledged that he had much work to do to deal with the tensions which unseated his predecessor. "We need to put yesterday's discord behind us and focus on the future together," he said. President Bush said of Mr Zoellick: "He has earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world." "He is deeply devoted to the mission of the World Bank," he added. He has to establish or rather re-establish confidence in the institution because it was a dark chapter with Wolfowitz Bernard Kouchner, French Foreign Minister Challenges facing new boss Choosing a World Bank boss As deputy secretary of state, Mr Zoellick was chief aide to Condoleezza Rice between February 2005 and June last year. He is also an ex-US trade representative and is currently an executive at the investment bank Goldman Sachs. Mr Zoellick's choice was praised by the new French government. "Mr. Zoellick is certainly the right man for the job," French Foreign Minister Bernard Kouchner said. But he added: "He has to establish or rather re-establish confidence in the institution because it was a dark chapter with Wolfowitz." But Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance, said that he thought Mr Zoellick was a terrible choice. President Bush said Mr Zoellick had built trust in all his top-level jobs "Zoellick has no significant experience in economic development in poor countries," he said. "He has been a close friend to the brand-name pharmaceutical industry, and the bilateral trade agreements he has negotiated effectively block access to generic medication for millions of people." President Bush also used his nomination speech to pay tribute to Paul Wolfowitz. "I thank him for his dedication to the poor and his devotion to the good work of the World Bank," he said. "Bob Zoellick is the right man to succeed Paul in this vital work."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6703523.stm prices 'still accelerating' 30 May 2007, 11:41 GMT 12:41 prices 'still accelerating' House price rises in Brighton & Hove are matching those in London Brighton & Hove has joined Greater London as the place in England and Wales where house prices are rising fastest, says the Land Registry. Property prices went up by 15.6% in both those areas in the year to April. In England and Wales prices rose by 9.1% on average, faster than the property inflation rate of 8.3% recorded in March. The average home in England and Wales now costs £179,935 - £15,003 more than a year ago. However David Stubbs, of the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, predicted the market would cool off. "The acceleration in price growth reflects the strength of the market in previous months but does not signal further strength in the future," he said. "Price rises will moderate as the year progresses." According to the Land Registry, prices are now rising more than twice as fast as they were a year ago. "In April 2006, the annual price change was 4.1%, less than half the 9.1% annual price change in April 2007," it said. The latest figures from the Land Registry lag only slightly behind other house price surveys, for instance those from mortgage lenders such as the Nationwide and the Halifax. These have both suggested recently that house price inflation has been running in double figures. The registry says overall prices are being driven by the market in London, where the cost of buying a home has been rising much faster than in England and Wales as a whole. As a result, the average London home, at £333,785, now costs nearly £154,000 more than the average for England and Wales. The area where prices have risen least in the past year is Nottingham. There they have gone up by just 1%, leaving the cost of an average property at £101,810. home costs deter buyers Spain real estate sell-off eases House price growth 'strengthens' Cheapest homes top £100k Mortgage lending is still booming Will house prices crash?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6707153.stm shares claw back losses GMT 10:00 shares claw back losses The central bank wants a market where big firms play a central role Chinese shares closed higher, despite a weak opening, following Wednesday's tripling of share trading tax. Chinese authorities decided to increase the tax from 0.1% to 0.3% in an attempt to clamp down on speculative trading. The Shanghai Composite Index closed 56.57 points or 1.4% higher at 4,109.65 having earlier dropped below 4,000. Larger companies led the rises after comments from the central bank were taken to mean that they might be less affected by the clamp down. A report from the central bank said it wanted to develop a stock market where larger companies, known as blue chips, played a leading role. Pudong Development Bank rose to its 10% daily limit, as did the oil refining giant Sinopec. Societe Generale showed confidence in the Chinese market by applying to double the amount it is allowed to invest in it. Pascal Sefrin, general manager of the French bank's Shanghai branch, said it had used up its initial quota under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor programme.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/england/devon/6707853.stm | Devon | Rise in profits for water company GMT 13:03 in profits for water company The rise in bills was almost double the average for the country South West Water (SWW) has announced a big rise in its profits. The news is likely to upset many of its 1.6m customers who currently have the largest water bills in the country and are facing a rise in the coming year. The Pennon Group, which owns SWW, made £131m in the last financial year - a rise in profits of more than 18%. The company's increased share price has led to takeover speculation, but it said the board was not aware of any particular reason for the rise. Operating profits for SWW lifted by 10.8% to £156.8m, while revenues rose by £33m to £381.5m, helped by price rises permitted in the current agreement with regulator Ofwat. In February it was announced average water and sewerage bills in the South West would rise by 16.1% for 2007 to 2008 for an unmetered property and 12.5% for a metered household. SWW's beach improving Clean Sweep programme has cost £1.5bn The average increase in England and Wales was 7%. In Devon, Cornwall and parts of Somerset and Dorset the hike means average customers paying annual charges of between £378 and £650. SWW said its increases were necessary to help pay for operation Clean Sweep to improve water quality around the region's coastline.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6705957.stm debt judgments at 10-year high 30 May 2007, 18:26 GMT 19:26 debt judgments at 10-year high Credit debts lead to the majority of CCJs being issued The number of County Court Judgments (CCJs) against consumer debtors has reached its highest level in almost 10 years, figures show. Nearly 250,000 CCJs were issued in England and Wales in the first three months of 2007 - up 9.5% on the same period a year ago. Lenders were "increasingly using the court route to deal with unsecured debts", the Registry Trust said. Experts said the data also showed more households were struggling financially. The 247,187 CCJs issued for consumer debt is the highest since the summer of 1997 The total number of judgements issued - including those served on businesses - was 296,841, up 9.1%. About 70% of the consumer CCJs were directly linked to credit, according to an estimate by the Registry Trust, which collates the data. Organisations such as the HM Revenue & Customs and water firms issued many of the others, it said, as did the Swansea-based Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency which takes out CCJs for non-payment of road tax. Debtors not complying with the terms of judgements are put on a CCJ register for six years, making it more difficult for them to take out loans or mortgages. "The dominant trend is upwards in consumer judgments and this quarter's record numbers give a warning to unsecured borrowers that their credit ratings are at risk and further proceedings are only a step away," said Malcolm Thurlston of the Registry Trust. Throughout the 1990s, judgments declined as the economy improved and lenders turned away from the courts. The latest data also showed a 12% growth in the number of searches of CCJ registers. face 'lifetime of debts' Overdraft fees in dock The UK's debt footprint OFT wins credit card cover appeal Store cards 'need rate warning' ' Repossession' entries 14-15 ' Payment deadline' entries 16-18 'Race against time' entries 19-20 'Creditor offer' entries 21-23 'Final thoughts' entries 24-25 Your credit rating explained Q&A: How to manage debt Interest-free deals laid bare Adopting a budget plan Golden rules of debt Take the Debt Test and get help and advice if you are in trouble Take our Financial Healthcheck ASK THE EXPERT ON DEBT More on borrowing and debt
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6692559.stm wins second charges case 29 May 2007, 13:36 GMT 14:36 wins second charges case Lloyds TSB is still giving thousands of pounds to customers who sue Lloyds TSB has won a second county court case against a customer trying to reclaim overdraft charges. A case was dismissed by a judge at Lancaster county court on 11 May, four days before a ruling in Birmingham against a claim from Kevin Berwick. A builder from Lancaster, Julian Rudd, had tried to recoup £3,000 in overdraft charges and interest. Lloyds TSB did not turn up to argue its case, but the judge decided Mr Rudd had failed to state an adequate claim. Judge Forrester, who heard the case, said: "It is ordered that the particulars of claim are struck out as disclosing no reasonable grounds for bringing the claim set out as a coherent set of facts, which if true, disclose a legally recognisable claim against the defendant." Mr Rudd, who did not attend the hearing either, said afterwards that he thought his paperwork might have been inadequate. "I have a feeling that if we had reworded it, we might have had a shout," he said. The man who lost in Birmingham county court on 15 May, Kevin Berwick, has decided not to appeal against the decision, but to go to the Financial Ombudsman Service instead. A QC's opinion suggested that he had failed because he had not put forward some important evidence, such as the exact terms and conditions of his account with Lloyds TSB. As a result of the lack of this evidence, the QC advised that the rest of the case was not important and did not deal with any legal principle. As the rules for appeals in civil cases do not allow fresh evidence to be brought forward, Mr Berwick has been advised that there would be no benefit in appealing. Marc Gander of the Consumer Action Group said: "These cases, in Lancaster and Birmingham, show that people have to be more careful about their preparation." Despite these two victories for Lloyds TSB, some courts around the country are becoming more annoyed at the standard bank tactic of failing to turn up in court to defend a claim, even though a written defence has been submitted. The court... is considering striking out the defence as an abuse of process Judge Thomas, Rhyl county court It has come to light that a district judge at Rhyl county court in Denbighshire has written to Lloyds TSB telling it to submit, by 5 June, a list of all the cases it has taken to trial and all the ones it has settled. The order of Judge Thomas says that if it fails to do this, "the court... is considering striking out the defence as an abuse of process on the basis that the defendant has settled all previous claims of this nature." At Worcester county court, a judge recently told one bank charges claimant, David Huckerby, in whose favour he had just ruled, that this was the 50th time that a bank - also Lloyds TSB - had failed to turn up before him and he was now getting "thoroughly fed up". These are the latest among a growing number of judicial criticisms. In recent months, similar comments have been made by judges in Lincoln, Leeds, Bristol and even the Mercantile Court in London, a branch of the High Court. There, Judge Mackie openly accused some banks of behaving unreasonably, by procrastinating when customers tried to sue them for the return of overdraft charges. Even though Lloyds TSB is, so far, the only bank to win such a case in any court, it is still continuing to settle cases against it. The campaigning website Moneysavingexpert records 24 separate examples of the bank agreeing to demands for refunds. All have come since 15 May, when news of the Birmingham judgement was revealed exclusively by the BBC News website. A Lloyds TSB spokeswoman told the BBC on Tuesday: "We do settle some cases, because we don't like to see our customers in court." Moneysavingexpert also records four cases in which the Clydesdale/Yorkshire bank has settled claims out of court since 15 May, even though it is telling claimants that from now on, it will rely on the Birmingham judgement in its own defence. However, a spokesman for that bank refused to say whether or not it would now instruct its solicitors to turn up in court to argue its case in front of a judge, or merely continue to rely on a written defence, in the hope that this would be persuasive.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6706819.stm chief executive at BHP named GMT 08:00 chief executive at BHP named Mr Kloppers will come under pressure to do deals, analysts say The world's largest miner, BHP Billiton, has named insider Marius Kloppers as its new chief executive. South African-born Mr Kloppers will take the helm on 1 October, replacing Chip Goodyear, who announced his retirement earlier in the year. With uncertainty over the future leadership of the Anglo-Australian firm resolved, analysts believe BHP could now be at the centre of a mega-merger. The announcement comes as profits continue to rise at the mining giant. In February, BHP said net profits during the second half of last year had jumped by 41% to $6bn thanks to strong demand for minerals, especially from China. A former management consultant, Mr Kloppers,44, joined Billiton in 1993 before the merger with BHP and was instrumental in the creation of the group's aluminium empire. He was most recently head of the group's most profitable nonferrous metals division, which includes aluminium, copper, tin and zinc. The inside appointment is seen by analysts as a sign of good succession planning within BHP and continuity, but also note the pressure he will be under to do deals amid a commodities boom that has triggered a rash of consolidation in the mining sector. Recent reports have suggested that BHP, which is based in Australia but is listed on the London stock market, might look to buy rival Rio Tinto or US aluminium miner Alcoa. announces 41% profit increase 07 Feb dethrones US metals king 09 Oct axes thousands to cut costs 23 Jun 05 | Business BHP output hit by copper strike 24 Oct Tinto uncovers record results 01 Feb Tinto's iron output rises 11% 18 Oct

Low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions are among the issues to be addressed by the Commission on Vulnerable Employment. The group, which has been established by the TUC, wants to expose poor treatment and look at how staff can be protected by government and bosses. Workers who feel exploited are urged to come forward with their stories. Business leaders have joined the commission, which plans to talk to exploited workers, including migrants and those working at home. The TUC said that as many as one in five workers could experience poor pay and conditions. "Most people will have the odd grumble about their job, but are treated fairly most of the time," said TUC general secretary Brendan Barber. "But some workers still experience rank exploitation that Charles Dickens would recognise. "Most of the time their experience is hidden, but we have had a recent rash of shocking exposures of poor treatment." Among the business leaders on the commission are Serco chairman Kevin Beeston and Jaeger chief executive Belinda Earl. "The commission is important because there is a real lack of information about the most vulnerable workers in our society," Mr Beeston said. Ms Earl added: "I support the cause of improving the working conditions and rights of Britain's vulnerable workers and would like to play a part in making this goal a reality." the immigrant underclass 25 Apr 07 | UK Women 'form half of all migrants' 06 Sep 06 | World Migrant workers face new slavery 19 Mar 07 | England Migrant workers gain mobile banks 08 Mar 07 | Technology Migrant worker numbers 'unknown' 06 Mar 07 | Wales Commission on Vulnerable Employment
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6704699.stm advice on pension opt-outs 30 May 2007, 14:13 GMT 15:13 advice on pension opt-outs A new pamphlet from the FSA gives advice on opt outs The Financial Services Authority (FSA) has published fresh advice to people who may have made a mistake by opting out of the state second pension (S2P). It says people should complain if they think they were wrongly advised to opt out between 1988 and 1997, Earlier this year the FSA said it had found no evidence of systematic mis-selling of the opt-out pensions. But it concluded that 120,000 people might still have been the victims of poor advice to leave the S2P. At the time, the S2P was known as the State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (Serps). It was the policy of the then Conservative government to encourage people to opt out of it, into an alternative personal pension, in order to give them greater choice and flexibility. The lure for people to do this was a rebate on their national insurance contributions, which was then invested into their new personal pension policies. Since then, the policy has become widely seen as a mistake, because of much lower-than-expected investment returns. But of the eight million or so people who have opted out at some time in their lives, very few, just 120,000, were making a potentially bad decision which the FSA now thinks should have been spotted at the time. The potential victims it is still worried about are those men who were over 45 at the time they contracted out, and those women who were over 40. They should have been identified as being too old, even then, to benefit from any extra investment potential of the new policies. However, the FSA says even they may, in some cases, have had valid reasons for still following the new policy. The FSA's pamphlet gives readers a guide on what they should do if they were above the relevant age limits, at any time between 1 July 1988 and 5 April 1997. It asks if they were not only above those ages, but were also advised to contract out, and were, in addition, unaware of any special reason for doing so. If they think they do fit these criteria, then they are advised to complain to the firm that gave them the advice and to ask for compensation. "If you were above the pivotal age, advice to contract out was likely to be wrong, unless there was a particular reason that outweighed the likely disadvantage," says the FSA. The average amount of pension that someone might have lost by opting out of the S2P is currently estimated at an average of £7 a week, though in reality some people may have lost nothing at all. However, the FSA warns that people will have no grounds for complaint if they took their own decision, without advice, or if they went ahead despite being advised not to do so. shut at police radio firm Ministers win fight over pensions Union backs BA pensions deal Tories call for pension lifeboat Brown defends pensions decision Brown protest by pension victims Q&A: You and your pension How the new pension plans will affect your retirement.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6705251.stm wages 'to top £1bn' 30 May 2007, 23:01 GMT 00:01 wages 'to top £1bn' Hands up if you get well paid.... Chelsea has the highest wage bill Premier League wages are set to break the £1bn barrier for the first time in the competition's history, a report from Deloitte has said. Salaries and bonuses will increase next season as a £1.7bn television deal for top-flight games comes into effect, the report says. Deloitte's annual review of football finances showed Premier League wages rose 9% to £854m in 2005/06. Chelsea's outlay totalled £114m while four other clubs paid more than £50m. The new TV revenue - including domestic and international rights - equates to about £300m extra per season over the lifetime of the current three-year deal. Whilst wages will rise, clubs do have the opportunity to increase the importance of performance related pay structures Sport Business Group, Deloitte However, Deloitte said the wave of new owners at clubs, including Aston Villa and Liverpool, was likely to result in more restraint in spending, with servicing debt and investing in stadia being other key priorities. "A lot of these new owners have had sporting success but also considerable financial success", said director of Deloitte's Sports Business group, Alan Switzer. "A decent chunk of the money will still flow through to the players, but we don't think it will be the same proportion that flowed through previously." JUST FANCY THAT! - STATS FROM THE 2005/06 SEASON Four Championship teams paid more in wages than they made in revenue Premier League and Football League clubs paid about £50m in agents fees France's Ligue 1 made a profit for the first time since 2000 English professional football paid about £650m in taxes Chelsea's pre-tax losses fell from £140m to £80m While spending on transfers is set to exceed £300m this summer, Deloitte's Paul Rawnsley said it was not viable for clubs to simply throw money at players. "Whilst wages will rise, clubs do have the opportunity to increase the importance of performance related pay structures," he said. "This will both insulate the business in future when on-pitch results are not so good, and also help motivate and reward players and management for winning." The report confirmed that the Premiership was once again the top-earning league in the world. Its 20 clubs generated £1.4bn in turnover on 2005/06, a figure expected to rise to £1.8bn in 2007/8. And the report pointed out that the increased revenue - alongside cost controls - should almost double combined operating profits to £260m next season. Manchester United was once again top of the English revenue league, making £167.7m. The club was followed by Chelsea on £152.8m, Arsenal on £133m and Liverpool on £121.6m. PREMIER LEAGUE'S TOP WAGE BILLS 2005/06 Manchester Utd - £85m Newcastle Utd - £52m Arsenal's revenue is expected to have soared in 2006/07, with its income from gate receipts and corporate hospitality boosted by its first season in the 60,000-capacity Emirates Stadium. Only nine Premiership clubs, however, actually made a pre-tax profit - down from 14 in 2004/05. Click here to see the wages of the Big Five leagues Wages paid to players in England again outstripped their European counterparts. The total wage bill in Italy, the second biggest in Europe, was 35% below the English level at 806m euros (£548m) while clubs in the much-admired Spanish La Liga shelled out 739m euros (£502m) to their stars. Should TV money be used to subsidise ticket prices? Although Italy was also the second highest earning league in Europe, falling matchday revenue was likely to see it slip behind Germany and Spain in the 2006/07 report. The "big five" European leagues generated 53% of the total £8.6bn European football market. Revenue generated by clubs in the Championship - the second tier in England - grew 4% to £312m, reaffirming it as Europe's sixth biggest league. Top league revenues 05/06 Last month Deloitte said promotion from the Championship to the Premiership this season would be worth about £60m for the successful clubs - Sunderland, Birmingham and Derby County. And the report highlighted the financial chasm between the two divisions. The gap between revenue at the average Premier League club and Championship side hit a record £56m in 2005/06 and was tipped to grow to £70m next season.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6708727.stm bankers warn of risky loans GMT 15:58 bankers warn of risky loans Mr Rhodes says the surge in liquidity is the greatest he has seen Top bankers have warned that many lenders are letting their standards slip and making imprudent loans. "Lenders all too often, are setting aside key documentation and credit standards," said William Rhodes, senior vice chairman of Citigroup. Members of the Institute of Internat- ional Finance (IIF) warned that banks who loosen their standards could regret it when the upswing has run its course. The IIF is an organisation of 360 financial institutions. It says that there is great pressure to lend money when interest rates are low and so money is relatively cheap. "As liquidity has continued to be high and the deal flow has accelerated we have seen a lowering of lending and investing standards in some markets," said Josef Ackermann from Deutsche Bank. Mr Rhodes said that while there has nor been such a sustained period of global economic growth since before World War I, all upswings eventually run their course. rise 'will squeeze borrowers' 10 How much money should you borrow? 27 Apr plays down lending risk 15 Mar grow for first-time buyers 20 Nov offer: Groundbreaking or gimmick? 01 Nov Nov of International Finance
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/newcastle_united/6693039.stm BBC SPORT | Football | My Club | Newcastle United | Newcastle consider Ashley offer GMT 15:19 consider Ashley offer Ashley purchased the Hall family's stake for £55m Newcastle's board are to "consider" an offer from Mike Ashley following discussions with the billionaire businessman on Thursday. United's board had previously made it clear they required more detail regarding Ashley's offer. That followed his acquisition of Sir John Hall's 41.6% stake. And earlier this month, Hall told BBC Radio Newcastle: "I feel Ashley and his team are right. He will take us to a new dimension." Sir John Hall on BBC Radio Newcastle Hall added: "I'm certain he'll be good for the club or I wouldn't have sold to him." Ashley purchased the Hall family's stake for £55m with the ultimate aim of clinching a complete £133.1m buy-out of chairman Freddy Shepherd and the remaining shareholders. We probably ran out of ideas a bit. There's no room for old men. I've got a lot of experience but it's a young man's game Shepherd, who has a 29.8% stake in the club, is thought to be shocked by recent events, but Hall has backed Ashley - who made his fortune through sportswear firm Sports World. "He knows the passion of the fans, he knows how much it means on Tyneside," Hall said. "I've talked to him enough to be assured they've got the passion for the club as we all have. "You can't run a club without being attached to it. You can't run a club without feeling for it because it is about people, it's about the passion of the people. "He knows the supporters are passionate." Shepherd and the Newcastle board are due to meet shortly to consider Ashley's offer of 100p per share. Ashley needs a 50% share to take control of the club, including who sits on the board That means Shepherd could lose control of the club even if he does not sell his 29% stake Ashley needs Shepherd's shares in order to reach the 75% required to delist the club from the Stock Exchange If Ashley manages to buy more than 50% of shares, he will have day-to-day control of the club and if he gets to 75%, he will be able to delist the club from the Stock Exchange. Hall will remain involved at St James' Park as life president but admitted the time was right for him to step aside. He said: "I think I've done the best thing but one can never tell. I'm 74 now and for some time I've felt the family need to take a new direction. "It's been known we've wanted to sell our shares and move on to other things. "We probably ran out of ideas a bit. You've got to make changes every now and again. "There's no room for old men. I've got a lot of experience but it's a young man's game."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/business/6706107.stm inflation still worrying Fed 30 May 2007, 20:05 GMT 21:05 inflation still worrying Fed Fed chief Ben Bernanke has left the possibility of rate rises open The US Federal Reserve continues to sees inflation as the "predominant concern" for the economy, minutes from its latest rate-setting meeting show. The Fed left interest rates unchanged at 5.25% on May 9, and many analysts say the inflation worries mean it will keep rates steady for some time. In its minutes, the Fed added that the housing market downturn had been more severe than expected. But it said the risk of the US economy slowing abruptly had lessened. "Nearly all participants viewed core inflation as remaining uncomfortably high and stressed the importance of further moderation," the minutes said. The slump in the housing market - and problems in the sub-prime lending market - has slowed US growth in recent months. And the Fed expressed concern that this could be exacerbated if the fall in house prices left consumers less willing to spend. "The correction of the housing sector is likely to continue to weigh heavily on economic activity through most of this year, somewhat longer than previously expected," the Fed said. This stance "contradicts" its public stance on the economy, said Andy Brenner of Man Financial. "It believes that housing will weigh on the market longer than anticipated." And Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at New York-based Johnson Ellington Advisors, said: "The implication is the economy may not turn out to be as good as forecast." "Their worries about growth are starting to pick up, and that certainly is appropriate," he added. approach will Democrats take to economic policy in Congress?
