http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/business/30bump.html Topping in at the US Airways counter in Phoenix for a flight to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. There were enough no-shows that no one was bumped. — The summer travel season is under way, and so many planes are expected to be full that, if you are bumped, you could end up waiting days for a seat on another flight to the same destination. on the Rise More Tickets than Seats Jeff Topping Mullin, a gate agent for US Airways in Phoenix, said she often must explain the overbooking of flights to passengers. The number of fliers bumped against their will is expected to reach a high for the decade this year. True, those travelers — about 56,000 of them — still represent only a small fraction of all passengers. But the increasing difficulty of rebooking bumped passengers has made the experience more maddening for fliers, and for the airline workers who deliver the bad news. A look behind the scenes of at the widespread practice of airline overbooking shows the industry’s struggle to fill every possible seat, including those left empty by the millions of passengers who buy a ticket but then do not show up. The effort at times pits a group of young math whizzes at the airline against battle-tested gate agents, who are often skeptical of the complex computer models used to predict no-shows and to overbook flights. Some agents even take matters into their own hands, creating phantom reservations — Mickey Mouse is a favorite passenger name, for example — to keep the math nerds at headquarters from overbooking a flight. “It’s a little bit of black art,” said Wallace Beall, senior director for revenue analysis who oversees overbooking at US Airways. Overbooking is one of many airline practices that are complicated by crowded planes. Airlines are running closer to capacity than at any point during the jet age — an expected 85 percent or so full this summer, which means all the seats on popular routes will be taken. Airlines, of course, overbook to avoid losing billions of dollars because of empty seats. Inevitably, though, they guess wrong on some flights and too many people arrive at the gate. Vouchers for free flights have long been used to convince enough passengers to stand aside and wait for the next flight. But now, more people are refusing the voucher — which can vary from a small dollar amount to a round-trip ticket anywhere an airline flies (people who are involuntarily bumped get up to $400 for their troubles). The reason is that fliers have figured out that with flights full, there are fewer and fewer seats to be bumped to. “I usually volunteer to be bumped,” said Pamela Ingram, a consultant who travels most weeks from her home in Binghamton, N.Y., and loves collecting airline vouchers for leisure travel. “But not lately,” she said. “It’s a different game. The wait can be days.” The number of people bumped involuntarily — those refusing the voucher — rose 23 percent last year and kept rising in the first quarter of this year. The ranks of all bumped passengers last year, 676,408, was small — unless you were one of them — compared with the 555 million total airline passengers. Airline workers, of course, do not like bumping, either. “It’s embarrassing,” said Brigid Mullin, a gate agent for US Airways here. On one or two flights a day, Ms. Mullin is left to explain to passengers that US Airways sold more tickets than it has seats on the plane. “People are going to yell,” Ms. Mullin said. Mr. Beall, the US Airways official, said, “Employees call in sick because they don’t want to deal with overbookings.” Other coping strategies by agents include entering phantom bookings — in addition to Mickey Mouse, they occasionally enter the name of W. Douglas Parker, the chief executive at US Airways — to keep a flight from being oversold. But phantom bookings later show up in the computer system as, you guessed it, a no-show, and the system then will overbook the next flight even more. “We call it the death spiral,” said Mr. Beall’s boss, Thomas Trenga, vice president for revenue management at US Airways. The airline has repeatedly told gate agents not to enter phantom bookings since US Airways and America West Airlines merged in the fall of 2005. At an employee meeting just after the merger, Mr. Parker was confronted about the issue by John Martino, then a gate agent in Boston. “You know you’re going to be yelled and screamed at to the point you have to call the police,” he said. Mr. Parker replied: “Why do we do so much of it? We will overbook as long as we allow people to no-show for flights; 7 to 8 percent of our customers are no-shows.” At some airlines, the no-show rate is higher, as passengers take advantage of refundable tickets, which include those bought by at the last minute. The potential impact is huge. US Airways had revenue of $11.56 billion last year and would have lost out on $1 billion or more of that had it not overbooked, the company said. And with profit of just $304 million for the year, and with other airlines operating on similarly slim margins, “we’d probably all go bankrupt” without overbooking, Mr. Trenga said. That said, Mr. Trenga acknowledged, “People view overbooking as something not on the up-and-up.” early access to articles from this Sunday's Times.

They include a 20-gallon rolling drum for transporting water, above. G. McNEIL Jr. Published: May 29, 2007 “A billion customers in the world,” Dr. Paul Polak told a crowd of inventors recently, “are waiting for a $2 pair of eyeglasses, a $10 solar lantern and a $100 house.” for Better Living A pot-in-pot cooler that relies on the evaporation of water from wet sand to cool the inner pot. The Lifestraw drinking filter, which kills bacteria as water is sucked through it. One computer for every child. A portable light mat. The world’s cleverest designers, said Dr. Polak, a former psychiatrist who now runs an organization helping poor farmers become entrepreneurs, cater to the globe’s richest 10 percent, creating items like wine labels, couture and Maseratis. “We need a revolution to reverse that silly ratio,” he said. To that end, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum , which is housed in Andrew Carnegie’s 64-room mansion on Fifth Avenue and offers a $250 red chrome piggy bank in its gift shop, is honoring inventors dedicated to “the other 90 percent,” particularly the billions of people living on less than $2 a day. Their creations, on display in the museum garden until Sept. 23, have a sort of forehead-thumping “Why didn’t someone think of that before?” quality. For example, and yet most elegant designs tackles a job that millions of women and girls spend many hours doing each year — fetching water. Balancing heavy jerry cans on the head may lead to elegant posture, but it is backbreaking work and sometimes causes crippling injuries. The Q-Drum, a circular jerry can, holds 20 gallons, and it rolls smoothly enough for a child to tow it on a rope. Interestingly, most of the designers who spoke at the opening of the exhibition spurned the idea of charity. “The No. 1 need that poor people have is a way to make more cash,” said Martin Fisher, an engineer who founded KickStart, an organization that says it has helped 230,000 people escape poverty. It sells human-powered pumps costing $35 to $95. Pumping water can help a farmer grow grain in the dry season, when it fetches triple the normal price. Dr. Fisher described customers who had skipped meals for weeks to buy a pump and then earned $1,000 the next year selling vegetables. “Most of the world’s poor are subsistence farmers, so they need a business model that lets them make money in three to six months, which is one growing season,” he said. KickStart accepts grants to support its advertising and find networks of sellers supplied with spare parts, for example. His prospective customers, Dr. Fisher explained, “don’t do market research.” “Many of them have never left their villages,” he said Sphere: Related Blogs & Articles (2 of 10) &#x00bb; The Lemelson Foundation, named for a prolific inventor, aims to reward inventions that help poor countries develop.

Little has changed over the years, not even the waiters. come around every few years, these rumors that Katz’s Delicatessen is about to close or move or somehow betray itself and those of us who care about it, and our response is always the same. Sung gasp. Then we listen for — and let ourselves be consoled by — the denials. And then our attention wanders, because there’s a part of us that doesn’t really believe Katz’s could ever crumble. It’s been around, after all, since 1888. That’s longer than Cindy Adams. It’s a strand of the city’s DNA, a bridge between past and present that’s no less a landmark than some bona fide architectural treasure. It’s immutable, isn’t it? Of course not, and let’s come back to that — to a conversation, by turns reassuring and slightly worrisome, with owners — in short order. But first let’s do something we don’t do often enough. Let’s take the occasion of the most recent rumors, which swirled just a few weeks ago, to pause and appreciate Katz’s. To take its measure in a format that grants it the kind of recognition typically reserved for restaurants more proper but no more deserving. To revel in its pastrami sandwich, in the land, with an eye-popping stack of brined beef that’s juicy, smoky, rapturous. To glory in the intricate ritual of the place: the taking of a ticket at the door; the lining-up in front of who carves that beef by hand; the tasting of the thick, ridged slices the server gives us as the sandwich is being built; the nodding when we’re asked if we want pickles, because of course we want pickles. It’s a ritual unique to Katz’s, an argument, along with Katz’s age, to consider it the king of New York delis, reigning above the Carnegie, above the Second Avenue Deli, which closed a year and a half ago. It may reopen, but not on Second Avenue, a reminder that nothing can be taken for granted. Katz’s shouldn’t be. At few other restaurants can you feel that you’ve stepped this surely into a living museum, a patch of urban mythology. Several dangling signs encourage you to “senda salami to your boy in the Army,” a piece of advice heeded today as it was during World War II. Enemies change. The appetite for sausage doesn’t. One dangling sign says, “Where Harry Met Sally.” Her pantomime of pleasure was set in Katz’s, chosen, no doubt, because nothing screams New York like pastrami or corned beef on rye, the bread of choice for almost every sandwich at Katz’s. At Katz’s I prefer the pastrami, though I’m crazy, too, about the tongue, which is less commonly available these days than it should be, given the tenderness of the meat. And at Katz’s, as at other delis of its stripe, there’s enough of that meat to feed several Army boys. The pastrami, naturally, is the best seller, by a margin of two to one over the corned beef, which comes in second, according to Fred Austin, who owns Katz’s with his business partner, Alan Dell. Katz’s sells about 1,000 pastrami sandwiches a day, Mr. Austin said, and there’s about a pound of meat, pre-trimming, per sandwich. Watching that trimming is part of the fun: no other New York deli emphasizes hand carving the way Katz’s does, be it for the pastrami, the corned beef or for that matter the turkey. The turkey says a lot about the restaurant’s pride in what it serves. Not what Katz’s is known for, it doesn’t need to be nearly as moist and appealing as it is. And while the Katz’s menu warns that a request for mayonnaise with a pastrami sandwich is made “at your own peril,” my request for mayo with my turkey sandwich was received, and granted, without incident. Legend has it that carvers dole out more meat to diners who tip them, but I didn’t see evidence of that. Legend has it that diners who elect table service and don’t actually stand in front of the carvers to fetch their own sandwiches get smaller ones filled with machine-sliced meat, but I didn’t experience that, either. Table service isn’t the way to go — it’s not that efficient and it takes the interactions with carvers out of the equation. Dinner isn’t the way to go, either. Katz’s doesn’t have quite the same energy late at night as it does early in the afternoon, when the big buses pull up, disgorging passengers whose postures are somewhat crooked and whose gaits aren’t all that steady. “You’ve got to assume it’s not the ‘Sex and the City’ tour,” said a lunch companion. & Wine (4 of 19) &#x00bb; Report a Problem Post (4.07 stars, 55 votes) Gustibus: Don&#8217;t Point That Menu at My Child, Please Basic Training: Modern Marathoners Have Fewer Miles on Them Disparities in Judging of Asylum Cases Contributor: Physician, Upgrade Thyself Op-Ed Contributor: Go, Eat, You Never Know Fault Harsh Methods in Interrogation Deal Said to Bring U.S. Scrutiny Iraqi Refugees, in Dire Straits, Turn to the Sex Trade in Syria Giuliani Tempers Tough Image on Campaign Justices' Ruling Limits Suits on Pay Disparity Hitherto Staunch G.O.P.

You can use a computer to pay your taxes, to program your TiVo or to read a message from your great-aunt, but your doctor has to practically level a forest just to examine your medical files. The cost, however, isn’t calculated in trees but in human lives: Electronic medical records would reduce the risk of medical errors and spare hospitals the expense of missing records and unnecessary treatment. Health care providers have been dreaming about electronic records for so long that the idea has begun to seem like vaporware, a never-to-be-realized fantasy similar to flying cars and jetpacks. But there is already a clear software standard, an open-source system that’s low-cost, easy to use and readily available. It could be the key to the health care system we ought to have already. The program, WorldVistA, is based on the Veterans Affairs Department’s electronic-records system, called VistA (short for Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture — and yes, they beat Bill Gates to the name). VistA stands as perhaps the greatest success story for government-developed information technology since the Internet itself. Using the VistA record system, the veterans department has managed to improve nearly every benchmark of quality in health care. In a decade, the department increased its pneumonia vaccination rate among at-risk patients to 94 percent from only 29 percent. That translates into 6,000 saved lives and $40 million saved each year from fewer pneumonia hospitalizations. On a host of other benchmarks — beta blocker use, cancer screening, cholesterol screening and so on — the department outperforms the nation’s best care. Thanks to VistA, costs per patient at the Veterans Health Administration system are 32 percent lower, using inflation-adjusted dollars, than they were a decade ago. Over the same period, the medical consumer price index has increased 50 percent for the country as a whole. The patients are happy, too. For the past eight years, the Veterans Health Administration has outscored private-sector health care in the independent American Customer Satisfaction Index. And because VistA is government-developed software, we all own it — it’s in the public domain. But while the government will mail you a copy, it won’t help install it or maintain it. The Department of Veterans Affairs is, in fact, prohibited by law to stray from its mission to serve veterans. So in 2002, a group of former Veterans Affairs programmers and open-source advocates formed WorldVistA. They set about making a version of VistA that was simple for health care providers to use, and the fruit of their effort is now ready for market. Like VistA, WorldVistA is robust and fast. In April, the software was approved by the Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology. The certification means that WorldVistA is ready for broad adoption. The effort to promote WorldVistA is supported by a grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the agency that sets the prices for Medicare and Medicaid payments. The agency wants to provide clinics and public hospitals, especially those that serve uninsured and underserved patients, with an inexpensive system for electronic medical records. The agency was also just getting tired of seeing another year go by without a significant increase in the adoption of digital records. Right now, only a quarter of office-based doctors use them. The problem isn’t a lack of software. There are hundreds of companies hawking electronic-records systems. But they don’t come cheap. The average cost is about $33,000 per doctor, plus another $1,500 a month per doctor for maintenance, according to a study published in the policy journal Health Affairs. For a small clinic with one or two doctors, that price is usually out of reach. For major hospitals, installing a new system can quickly become a multimillion-dollar experiment. WorldVistA, thanks to its public-domain origins, costs about one-tenth of what a proprietary system does for a license fee and a support contract. And like any good open-source project, it’s constantly improving. A community of programmers fixes glitches and adds features, just as is done for the open-source Firefox browser and the Linux operating system. And WorldVistA can be scaled up or down. It can work for neighborhood clinics, small-town hospitals, hospital systems, or, well, the Department of Veterans Affairs. WorldVistA’s big promise is that it can become the nationwide standard for electronic medical records, the backbone of a national network of health care. Your medical records could be read instantly and understood (perhaps less instantly) by any provider, anywhere. Want to see the best knee surgeon in the country? If he’s using WorldVistA, he can check out your online records at his house or office. If you switch jobs and move to a new insurance plan, you won’t need to build a new medical history and FedEx old records around. With your permission, your files will be accessible to your new providers instantly. In this way, electronic medical records generate better care and lower costs. WorldVistA isn’t perfect. It isn’t as customizable as some proprietary systems, and its graphical interface isn’t as intuitive or as polished. Worse, its back-office functions — staffing and billing — aren’t all that strong. Major hospitals and health maintenance organizations in search of a Cadillac are free to spend the dollars to buy one. But for the vast majority of health care providers, WorldVistA is what they’ve been waiting for: a low-cost, simple-to-use system that makes it easier to provide quality health care. If only it could upgrade the waiting-room magazines, too.

Diani in Santa Monica, Calif., is offering filtered tap water to diners. All their water comes out of the tap. It’s filtered before it reaches the table, but it’s from the public water system, just the same. “Serving our local water in reusable carafes makes more sense for the environment than manufacturing thousands of single-use glass bottles for someone to use once and throw away,” Incanto explains at its Web site. These two Bay Area restaurants were pretty much alone in kicking the bottle habit until Alice Waters, the godmother of things organic, sustainable and local, banned bottled still water at Chez Panisse in Berkeley last year and started serving only house-made sparkling water this year. Then the press took notice. Now other California restaurants, like Nopa in San Francisco, are following suit. Even an ice cream shop — Ici, in Berkeley — has jumped on the non-bottled-water wagon. And now, with a little push from Ms. Waters, an important New York City restaurant is coming on board. It’s a big move in the restaurant industry, which, if you extrapolate from the amount of water it buys, takes in at least $200 million to $350 million from bottled water a year, according to the restaurant consultant Clark Wolf. The “eat local” movement first became popular in California, so it makes sense that “drink local” is catching on there as a way to reduce the environmental costs of manufacturing and transporting bottles of water, as well as the mountains of plastic that end up in landfills. But soon the owners of Del Posto in New York, the most elegant and expensive of the restaurants in the empire of Joseph Bastianich and Mario Batali, will be joining the nascent movement — once they decide on the proper containers for their filtered still and carbonated tap water. Etched on the glass will be an explanation of why bottled water is no longer available. “Filling cargo ships with water and sending it hundreds and thousands of miles to get it around the world seems ridiculous,” Mr. Bastianich said. “With all the other things we do for sustainability, it makes sense.” He added that of all their restaurants, Del Posto was best able to afford the change. When Maury Rubin opened the first Birdbath Neighborhood Green Bakery in the East Village in 2005 and the second in Greenwich Village last month, banning bottled water was a no-brainer. “It was actually an easy decision,” Mr. Rubin said. “Bottled water is not great for the environment.” Other restaurants, including the Farmers Diner in Quechee, Vt., have made the switch, but they have not made waves. Tod Murphy, who owns the diner and has gained a certain celebrity in the food world for serving local products, stopped ordering bottled water in February. “It makes no sense, because we have great well water,” he said, “but I had no idea I was on the cutting edge.” For almost everyone else the idea is still in the talking stage, in part because there’s a big profit in bottled water, even though some of it comes out of a tap before it goes into the bottle. Restaurants buy it for $1 or $2 and sell it for as much as $8, or even more, giving it the highest markup of any item on the menu. Most restaurants making their own sparkling water are not charging for it. Geoffrey Zakarian, the chef and an owner of Country in Manhattan, described the ban as “a worthy thing to do.” But he added, “You have to make a profit.” “Alice is very commendable and extraordinary, and we look to her,” Mr. Zakarian said, “but I think she gets carried away sometimes.” He wondered where he would make up the lost revenue if he eliminated bottled water. “Serving tap water is a great idea that we’d all love to be able to do, but it’s not going to happen all at once.” Tom Colicchio, the chef and an owner of Craft restaurant and several spinoffs, was incredulous that restaurants would contemplate such a change. “This is the first I’ve heard of it,” he said. “Why would you do that — not from a money standpoint, but from a service and hospitality standpoint? Fifty to 60 percent prefer bottled water, especially sparkling.” & Wine (2 of 19) &#x00bb; & Wine (2 of 19) &#x00bb; De Gustibus: Don&#8217;t Point That Menu at My Child, Please Basic Training: Modern Marathoners Have Fewer Miles on Them Disparities in Judging of Asylum Cases Contributor: Physician, Upgrade Thyself Op-Ed Contributor: Go, Eat, You Never Know Fault Harsh Methods in Interrogation Deal Said to Bring U.S. Scrutiny Iraqi Refugees, in Dire Straits, Turn to the Sex Trade in Syria Giuliani Tempers Tough Image on Campaign Justices' Ruling Limits Suits on Pay Disparity Hitherto Staunch G.O.P.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/business/30leonhardt.html whole controversy involving Lou Dobbs and leprosy started with a “60 Minutes” segment a few weeks ago. Caplin Dobbs was at the anchor desk for CNN&#146;s 2006 election coverage. Bush Takes On Conservatives Over Immigration Episodes of "Lou Dobbs Tonight" "60 Minutes" of May 6, 2007 The segment was a profile of Mr. Dobbs, and while doing background research for it, a “60 Minutes” producer came across a 2005 news report from Mr. Dobbs’s CNN program on contagious diseases. In the report, one of Mr. Dobbs’s correspondents said there had been 7,000 cases of leprosy in this country over the previous three years, far more than in the past. When Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” sat down to Mr. Dobbs on camera, she mentioned the report and told him that there didn’t seem to be much evidence for it. “Well, I can tell you this,” he replied. “If we reported it, it’s a fact.” With that Orwellian chestnut, Mr. Dobbs escalated the leprosy dispute into a full-scale media brouhaha. The next night, back on , the same CNN correspondent who had done the earlier report, Christine Romans, repeated the 7,000 number, and Mr. Dobbs added that, if anything, it was probably an underestimate. A week later, the Southern Poverty Law Center — the civil rights group that has long been critical of Mr. Dobbs — took out advertisements in USA Today demanding that CNN run a correction. Finally, Mr. Dobbs played to two top officials from the law center on his program, “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” where he called their accusations outrageous and they called him wrong, unfair and “one of the most popular people on the white supremacist Web sites.” We’ll get to the merits of the charges and countercharges shortly, but first it’s worth considering why, beyond entertainment value, all this matters. Over the last few years, Lou Dobbs has transformed himself into arguably this country’s foremost populist. It’s an odd role, given that he spent the 1980s and ’90s buttering up chief executives on CNN, but he’s now playing it very successfully. He has become a voice for the real economic anxiety felt by many Americans. The audience for his program has grown 72 percent since 2003, and — yes, the same network that broadcasts “60 Minutes” — as a commentator on “The Early Show.” Many elites, as Mr. Dobbs likes to call them, despise him, but others see him as a hero. His latest book, “War on the Middle Class,” was a best seller and received a sympathetic review in this newspaper. Mario Cuomo has said Mr. Dobbs is “addicted to economic truth.” Mr. Dobbs argues that the middle class has many enemies: corporate lobbyists, greedy executives, wimpy journalists, corrupt politicians. But none play a bigger role than illegal immigrants. As he sees it, they are stealing our jobs, depressing our wages and even endangering our lives. That’s where leprosy comes in. “The invasion of illegal aliens is threatening the health of many Americans,” Mr. Dobbs said on his April 14, 2005, . From there, he introduced his original report that mentioned leprosy, the flesh-destroying disease — technically known as Hansen’s disease — that has inspired fear for centuries. According to a woman CNN identified as a medical lawyer named Dr. Madeleine Cosman, leprosy was on the march. As Ms. Romans, the CNN correspondent, relayed: “There were about 900 cases of leprosy for 40 years. There have been 7,000 in the past three years.” “Incredible,” Mr. Dobbs replied. Mr. Dobbs and Ms. Romans engaged in a a few weeks ago, when he was defending himself the night after the “60 Minutes” segment. “Suddenly, in the past three years, America has more than 7,000 cases of leprosy,” she said, again attributing the number to Ms. Cosman. To sort through all this, I called James L. Krahenbuhl, the director of the National Hansen’s Disease Program , an arm of the federal government. Leprosy in the United States is indeed largely a disease of immigrants who have come from Asia and Latin America. And the do show about 7,000 diagnosed cases — but that’s over the last , not the last three. The peak year was 1983, when there were 456 cases. After that, reported cases dropped steadily, falling to just 76 in 2000. Last year, there were 137. “It is not a public health problem — that’s the bottom line,” Mr. Krahenbuhl told me. “You’ve got a country of 300 million people. This is not something for the public to get alarmed about.” Much about the disease remains unknown, but researchers think people get it through prolonged close contact with someone who already has it. What about the increase over the last six years, to 137 cases from 76? Is that significant? “No,” Mr. Krahenbuhl said. It could be a statistical fluctuation, or it could be a result of better data collection in recent years. In any event, the 137 reported cases last year were fewer than in any year from 1975 to 1996. So Mr. Dobbs was flat-out wrong. And when I spoke to him yesterday, he admitted as much, sort of. I read him Ms. Romans’s comment — the one with the word “suddenly” in it — and he replied, “I think that is wrong.” He then went on to say that as far as he was concerned, he had corrected the mistake by later broadcasting another report, on the same night as his with the Southern Poverty Law Center officials. This report mentioned that leprosy had peaked in 1983.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/29/science/29cheap.html Poor The exhibition at the Cooper-Hewitt has many items to show a grasp of the depths of world poverty and ingenious ways to attack it. They include a 20-gallon rolling drum for transporting water, above. G. McNEIL Jr. Published: May 29, 2007 “A billion customers in the world,” Dr. Paul Polak told a crowd of inventors recently, “are waiting for a $2 pair of eyeglasses, a $10 solar lantern and a $100 house.” for Better Living A pot-in-pot cooler that relies on the evaporation of water from wet sand to cool the inner pot. The Lifestraw drinking filter, which kills bacteria as water is sucked through it. One computer for every child. A portable light mat. The world’s cleverest designers, said Dr. Polak, a former psychiatrist who now runs an organization helping poor farmers become entrepreneurs, cater to the globe’s richest 10 percent, creating items like wine labels, couture and Maseratis. “We need a revolution to reverse that silly ratio,” he said. To that end, the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum , which is housed in Andrew Carnegie’s 64-room mansion on Fifth Avenue and offers a $250 red chrome piggy bank in its gift shop, is honoring inventors dedicated to “the other 90 percent,” particularly the billions of people living on less than $2 a day. Their creations, on display in the museum garden until Sept. 23, have a sort of forehead-thumping “Why didn’t someone think of that before?” quality. For example, and yet most elegant designs tackles a job that millions of women and girls spend many hours doing each year — fetching water. Balancing heavy jerry cans on the head may lead to elegant posture, but it is backbreaking work and sometimes causes crippling injuries. The Q-Drum, a circular jerry can, holds 20 gallons, and it rolls smoothly enough for a child to tow it on a rope. Interestingly, most of the designers who spoke at the opening of the exhibition spurned the idea of charity. “The No. 1 need that poor people have is a way to make more cash,” said Martin Fisher, an engineer who founded KickStart, an organization that says it has helped 230,000 people escape poverty. It sells human-powered pumps costing $35 to $95. Pumping water can help a farmer grow grain in the dry season, when it fetches triple the normal price. Dr. Fisher described customers who had skipped meals for weeks to buy a pump and then earned $1,000 the next year selling vegetables. “Most of the world’s poor are subsistence farmers, so they need a business model that lets them make money in three to six months, which is one growing season,” he said. KickStart accepts grants to support its advertising and find networks of sellers supplied with spare parts, for example. His prospective customers, Dr. Fisher explained, “don’t do market research.” “Many of them have never left their villages,” he said Sphere: Related Blogs & Articles (2 of 10) &#x00bb; The Lemelson Foundation, named for a prolific inventor, aims to reward inventions that help poor countries develop.

There were enough no-shows that no one was bumped. — The summer travel season is under way, and so many planes are expected to be full that, if you are bumped, you could end up waiting days for a seat on another flight to the same destination. on the Rise More Tickets than Seats Jeff Topping Mullin, a gate agent for US Airways in Phoenix, said she often must explain the overbooking of flights to passengers. The number of fliers bumped against their will is expected to reach a high for the decade this year. True, those travelers — about 56,000 of them — still represent only a small fraction of all passengers. But the increasing difficulty of rebooking bumped passengers has made the experience more maddening for fliers, and for the airline workers who deliver the bad news. A look behind the scenes of at the widespread practice of airline overbooking shows the industry’s struggle to fill every possible seat, including those left empty by the millions of passengers who buy a ticket but then do not show up. The effort at times pits a group of young math whizzes at the airline against battle-tested gate agents, who are often skeptical of the complex computer models used to predict no-shows and to overbook flights. Some agents even take matters into their own hands, creating phantom reservations — Mickey Mouse is a favorite passenger name, for example — to keep the math nerds at headquarters from overbooking a flight. “It’s a little bit of black art,” said Wallace Beall, senior director for revenue analysis who oversees overbooking at US Airways. Overbooking is one of many airline practices that are complicated by crowded planes. Airlines are running closer to capacity than at any point during the jet age — an expected 85 percent or so full this summer, which means all the seats on popular routes will be taken. Airlines, of course, overbook to avoid losing billions of dollars because of empty seats. Inevitably, though, they guess wrong on some flights and too many people arrive at the gate. Vouchers for free flights have long been used to convince enough passengers to stand aside and wait for the next flight. But now, more people are refusing the voucher — which can vary from a small dollar amount to a round-trip ticket anywhere an airline flies (people who are involuntarily bumped get up to $400 for their troubles). The reason is that fliers have figured out that with flights full, there are fewer and fewer seats to be bumped to. “I usually volunteer to be bumped,” said Pamela Ingram, a consultant who travels most weeks from her home in Binghamton, N.Y., and loves collecting airline vouchers for leisure travel. “But not lately,” she said. “It’s a different game. The wait can be days.” The number of people bumped involuntarily — those refusing the voucher — rose 23 percent last year and kept rising in the first quarter of this year. The ranks of all bumped passengers last year, 676,408, was small — unless you were one of them — compared with the 555 million total airline passengers. Airline workers, of course, do not like bumping, either. “It’s embarrassing,” said Brigid Mullin, a gate agent for US Airways here. On one or two flights a day, Ms. Mullin is left to explain to passengers that US Airways sold more tickets than it has seats on the plane. “People are going to yell,” Ms. Mullin said. Mr. Beall, the US Airways official, said, “Employees call in sick because they don’t want to deal with overbookings.” Other coping strategies by agents include entering phantom bookings — in addition to Mickey Mouse, they occasionally enter the name of W. Douglas Parker, the chief executive at US Airways — to keep a flight from being oversold. But phantom bookings later show up in the computer system as, you guessed it, a no-show, and the system then will overbook the next flight even more. “We call it the death spiral,” said Mr. Beall’s boss, Thomas Trenga, vice president for revenue management at US Airways. The airline has repeatedly told gate agents not to enter phantom bookings since US Airways and America West Airlines merged in the fall of 2005. At an employee meeting just after the merger, Mr. Parker was confronted about the issue by John Martino, then a gate agent in Boston. “You know you’re going to be yelled and screamed at to the point you have to call the police,” he said. Mr. Parker replied: “Why do we do so much of it? We will overbook as long as we allow people to no-show for flights; 7 to 8 percent of our customers are no-shows.” At some airlines, the no-show rate is higher, as passengers take advantage of refundable tickets, which include those bought by at the last minute. The potential impact is huge. US Airways had revenue of $11.56 billion last year and would have lost out on $1 billion or more of that had it not overbooked, the company said. And with profit of just $304 million for the year, and with other airlines operating on similarly slim margins, “we’d probably all go bankrupt” without overbooking, Mr. Trenga said. That said, Mr. Trenga acknowledged, “People view overbooking as something not on the up-and-up.” by Airlines Rise, but F.A.A.

Caplin Dobbs was at the anchor desk for CNN&#146;s 2006 election coverage. Bush Takes On Conservatives Over Immigration Episodes of "Lou Dobbs Tonight" "60 Minutes" of May 6, 2007 The segment was a profile of Mr. Dobbs, and while doing background research for it, a “60 Minutes” producer came across a 2005 news report from Mr. Dobbs’s CNN program on contagious diseases. In the report, one of Mr. Dobbs’s correspondents said there had been 7,000 cases of leprosy in this country over the previous three years, far more than in the past. When Lesley Stahl of “60 Minutes” sat down to Mr. Dobbs on camera, she mentioned the report and told him that there didn’t seem to be much evidence for it. “Well, I can tell you this,” he replied. “If we reported it, it’s a fact.” With that Orwellian chestnut, Mr. Dobbs escalated the leprosy dispute into a full-scale media brouhaha. The next night, back on , the same CNN correspondent who had done the earlier report, Christine Romans, repeated the 7,000 number, and Mr. Dobbs added that, if anything, it was probably an underestimate. A week later, the Southern Poverty Law Center — the civil rights group that has long been critical of Mr. Dobbs — took out advertisements in USA Today demanding that CNN run a correction. Finally, Mr. Dobbs played to two top officials from the law center on his program, “Lou Dobbs Tonight,” where he called their accusations outrageous and they called him wrong, unfair and “one of the most popular people on the white supremacist Web sites.” We’ll get to the merits of the charges and countercharges shortly, but first it’s worth considering why, beyond entertainment value, all this matters. Over the last few years, Lou Dobbs has transformed himself into arguably this country’s foremost populist. It’s an odd role, given that he spent the 1980s and ’90s buttering up chief executives on CNN, but he’s now playing it very successfully. He has become a voice for the real economic anxiety felt by many Americans. The audience for his program has grown 72 percent since 2003, and — yes, the same network that broadcasts “60 Minutes” — as a commentator on “The Early Show.” Many elites, as Mr. Dobbs likes to call them, despise him, but others see him as a hero. His latest book, “War on the Middle Class,” was a best seller and received a sympathetic review in this newspaper. Mario Cuomo has said Mr. Dobbs is “addicted to economic truth.” Mr. Dobbs argues that the middle class has many enemies: corporate lobbyists, greedy executives, wimpy journalists, corrupt politicians. But none play a bigger role than illegal immigrants. As he sees it, they are stealing our jobs, depressing our wages and even endangering our lives. That’s where leprosy comes in. “The invasion of illegal aliens is threatening the health of many Americans,” Mr. Dobbs said on his April 14, 2005, .

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/opinion/31brownback.html 2007 IN our sound-bite political culture, it is unrealistic to expect that every complicated issue will be addressed with the nuance or subtlety it deserves. So I suppose I should not have been surprised earlier this month when, during the first Republican presidential debate, the candidates on stage were asked to raise their hands if they did not “believe” in evolution. As one of those who raised his hand, I think it would be helpful to discuss the issue in a bit more detail and with the seriousness it demands. The premise behind the question seems to be that if one does not unhesitatingly assert belief in evolution, then one must necessarily believe that God created the world and everything in it in six 24-hour days. But limiting this question to a stark choice between evolution and creationism does a disservice to the complexity of the interaction between science, faith and reason. The heart of the issue is that we cannot drive a wedge between faith and reason. I believe wholeheartedly that there cannot be any contradiction between the two. The scientific method, based on reason, seeks to discover truths about the nature of the created order and how it operates, whereas faith deals with spiritual truths. The truths of science and faith are complementary: they deal with very different questions, but they do not contradict each other because the spiritual order and the material order were created by the same God. People of faith should be rational, using the gift of reason that God has given us. At the same time, reason itself cannot answer every question. Faith seeks to purify reason so that we might be able to see more clearly, not less. Faith supplements the scientific method by providing an understanding of values, meaning and purpose. More than that, faith — not science — can help us understand the breadth of human suffering or the depth of human love. Faith and science should go together, not be driven apart. The question of evolution goes to the heart of this issue. If belief in evolution means simply assenting to microevolution, small changes over time within a species, I am happy to say, as I have in the past, that I believe it to be true. If, on the other hand, it means assenting to an exclusively materialistic, deterministic vision of the world that holds no place for a guiding intelligence, then I reject it. There is no one single theory of evolution, as proponents of punctuated equilibrium and classical Darwinism continue to feud today. Many questions raised by evolutionary theory — like whether man has a unique place in the world or is merely the chance product of random mutations — go beyond empirical science and are better addressed in the realm of philosophy or theology. The most passionate advocates of evolutionary theory offer a vision of man as a kind of historical accident. That being the case, many believers — myself included — reject arguments for evolution that dismiss the possibility of divine causality. Ultimately, on the question of the origins of the universe, I am happy to let the facts speak for themselves. There are aspects of evolutionary biology that reveal a great deal about the nature of the world, like the small changes that take place within a species. Yet I believe, as do many biologists and people of faith, that the process of creation — and indeed life today — is sustained by the hand of God in a manner known fully only to him. It does not strike me as anti-science or anti-reason to question the philosophical presuppositions behind theories offered by scientists who, in excluding the possibility of design or purpose, venture far beyond their realm of empirical science. Biologists will have their debates about man’s origins, but people of faith can also bring a great deal to the table. For this reason, I oppose the exclusion of either faith or reason from the discussion. An attempt by either to seek a monopoly on these questions would be wrong-headed. As science continues to explore the details of man’s origin, faith can do its part as well. The fundamental question for me is how these theories affect our understanding of the human person. The unique and special place of each and every person in creation is a fundamental truth that must be safeguarded. I am wary of any theory that seeks to undermine man’s essential dignity and unique and intended place in the cosmos. I firmly believe that each human person, regardless of circumstance, was willed into being and made for a purpose. While no stone should be left unturned in seeking to discover the nature of man’s origins, we can say with conviction that we know with certainty at least part of the outcome. Man was not an accident and reflects an image and likeness unique in the created order. Those aspects of evolutionary theory compatible with this truth are a welcome addition to human knowledge. Aspects of these theories that undermine this truth, however, should be firmly rejected as an atheistic theology posing as science. Without hesitation, I am happy to raise my hand to that.
