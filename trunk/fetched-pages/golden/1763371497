http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7756477.html Driver sparks chaos with reckless U-turns sparks chaos with reckless U-turns PM PDT MARYSVILLE, Wash. -- State troopers are looking for the wrong-way driver who sparked chaos on Interstate-5 through Marysville by making reckless U-turns on Wednesday morning. A driver on the on-ramp from 88th Street to the northbound lanes of I-5 turned left at the bottom of the ramp and headed into oncoming traffic. A driver in a black car swerved to miss her, lost control and hit the cable barrier. "Impacted the cable barrier and went halfway up the embankment to the bridge pillar and the cable brought him back down," said Dave Nearing, a witness. That second driver, who is described as an Everett man, was not hurt. The wrong-way driver continued to head south in the northbound lanes, made another u-turn and headed up the exit ramp back to 88th Street Northeast. "There was simply no reason for her to do what she did, put that many lives at risk," said Trooper Kirk Rudeen. "It is simply inexcusable. We want to find her and talk to her." Troopers describe the driver as a blond woman in her 20s. They believe she was driving a brown Honda Civic or Accord. Anyone who witnessed the reckless driver or know her whereabouts is urged to contact the Washington State Patrol. sparks chaos with reckless U-turns
http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7754772.html Partially decomposed body found in southwest Washington decomposed body found in southwest Washington PM PDT STEVENSON, Wash. (AP) - The Skamania County sheriff's office reported that a partially decomposed body has been discovered in a wooded area 21 miles east of Cougar. Undersheriff David Cox says the body is believed to be that of 64-year-old Janet Durall, of Quartzite, Arizona. Cox says the body was found last Saturday after an extensive search of possible locations in the area surrounding the southern flanks of Mount St. Helens. An autopsy has been conducted and detectives are awaiting the results. The sheriff's office says information which led to the discovery of the body was obtained through interviews with William Spear, of Camp Verde, Arizona. Cox says Spear and Durall were vacationing in the area. He says they were boyfriend and girlfriend. Cox says Spear abandoned the body and returned to Arizona before contacting authorities. An investigation is continuing, but Cox says there is no indication that foul play took place.
http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7752072.html Toddler recovering after being dragged by dog recovering after being dragged by dog Dog drags baby down street in freak accident PM PDT By Joe English and KATU Web Staff LONGVIEW, Wash. - A Longview toddler who was dragged by a large dog down an alleyway is still in the hospital, but his condition is greatly improved, according to doctors and the boy's family. The 18-month-old boy, named Lincoln, was in his stroller out on a walk with his mother and the family dog, a large Pit Bull/Mastiff mix, when his mother says something spooked the dog and it began to run off. The dog's leash reportedly caught the stroller and the powerful, 100 pound dog pulled the baby carrier with Lincoln inside down an alleyway strewn with gravel. The stroller overturned, and Lincoln, still strapped in, was pulled along the ground for several blocks. Passersby and the boy's mother and her fiancee eventually caught up with the dog, but Lincoln was badly injured. Following treatment for a fractured skull, doctors and family say Lincoln is recovering but still has gravel embedded in his body. He still has heavy wrappings on his head and will need to stay in the hospital for a few more days. His arms and back were also injured, but less severely. Doctors say they are not sure if Lincoln suffered any brain damage or if the incident will have any lasting effect on the boy. His mother, Twylah Miller, says he is getting back to his normal behavior and is a little cranky, which she says is a good sign. But she also said he is having nightmares about the incident. The family said the dog is a good dog but they have decided to return him to the Humane Society where they got him. Police say they believe the dog is not dangerous and no charges will be filed in connection with the incident.

The college says late last week, a student discovered a threat written on a toilet paper dispenser in a men's restroom that said: "I will kill everyone at SCCC on May 31." College spokeswoman Laura Mansfield says the person who wrote the threat hasn't been caught. Mansfield says Seattle police officers will patrol the campus on Thursday, and college staff will hand out fliers to students as they arrive on campus informing them of the threat. Mansfield says the college warned the campus community about the threat in an e-mail on Friday and again on Wednesday. The campus president also posted a message on the college's Web site. The college's Broadway Edison and Science and Mathematics buildings will be on lockdown. In April, a University of Washington employee was shot and killed in her campus office by her ex-boyfriend in April.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7759372.html Scam targets identities of soldiers overseas targets identities of soldiers overseas 2007 at 7:22 AM PDT Thieves are targeting the families of military families all over the country by lying about casualties of war. The scam involves thieves calling families of military personnel deployed overseas and claiming to be with the American Red Cross. Thieves reportedly tell the family members their loved one has been injured overseas. The scammers then ask for the soldier's personal information in order to complete the paperwork needed for medical treatment. Red Cross representatives say the agency never calls families asking for personal information. It also does not inform families of injuries or deaths. "If anybody does come to you and asks you questions that seem strange or suspicious, you don't want to give away any of your personal information," said Katherine Boury with the Red Cross. "You want to call your local Red Cross and say, 'this doesn't seem right.'" Boury says similar scams have surfaced in the past during natural disasters or a national crisis. "Hurricane Katrina, September 11th. There are sometimes going to be people that misrepresent the Red Cross, and so we take that very seriously," she said. Fort Lewis spokesperson Blake Draheim said that soldiers and their families are briefed on what to expect in the event of an emergency call. If a soldier is injured or killed, family members should expect a personal knock on the door or a direct call from a member of the overseas unit. "We're out here serving our country .Why try to steal our identity? We're out here fighting for you," Draheim said. "Our social security number that we have is our paycheck, everything. It's our whole career and without that, we're in trouble."
http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7759477.html Ship sickens 2 local families on 2 separate trips sickens 2 local families on 2 separate trips PM PDT Two local families say they got sick on the same cruise ship, but on two separate trips. Dolores and Herman Warfield just returned from their 22nd cruise adventure on the Norwegian Star's Alaska cruise. They paid for a seven-day trip, but their vacation was over in just 72 hours. "On the third day out, we both came down with the norwalk virus," Dolores said. The couple was quarantined in their cabin, leaving only to see the ship's doctor. During their frequent visits to the infirmary, they learned other passengers had fallen sick as well. But there was no way to know exactly how many; the Warfields say the staff never made an announcement and never warned passengers of the sick quarantined in their cabins. Norwegian Cruise Line confirmed in a statement that six percent of their passengers, or roughly 130 people, reported symptoms of the stomach flu. The cruise line stated it carried out an extensive range of preventative measures on board, and did not expect the issue would carry forward into the next cruise. But it did. Gina Schacht boarded the Star the same day the Warfields disembarked. As a 75-year-old diabetic awaiting a kidney transplant, the Alaska cruise was her last vacation. She and her daughter came home a week later with a big bill and memories they'd rather forget. "Trip from hell I say, because all my time I spent in a cabin, being sick," she said. Schacht says the cruise credited her $275 for some expenses, but not the cost of what should've been her dream trips. "I think I spent my money for nothing, if I'm gonna be sick, I'll be sick at home. I don't have to spend over a $1,000 to lay in bed," she said. In an official statement, Norwegian Cruise Line never says it was the norwalk virus that sickened the people on board, though passengers tell KOMO 4 News the ship's doctor confirmed it. Schacht says she fortunately bought traveler's insurance, and hopes to be reimbursed for the days she missed. The Warfields hope to be reimbursed for the $200 they spend at the infirmary.
http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7748557.html Seattle gets sneak peek at summer gets sneak peek at summer AM PM PDT "In a world... where clouds are non-existent, and shade has become a precious commodity, one city's residents will do what it takes to fend off an infrared invasion. It's: Seattle Summer....'07!" Pirates, green ogres and a superhero who means it literally when he says he's created a web site might be the talk of May so far, but the real trailer for our blockbuster summer might have edged them all. The heart of summer is still a good 5-6 weeks away, but today is a good preview of what might be coming soon to a thermometer near you. A strong ridge of high pressure has combined with a thermal trough to bring sunny and hot weather to most of western Washington today. How hot? Most the area from Everett south were well into the 80s. Seattle tied its record high for the day at 87 degrees, set also in 1956. Here's how some of the other cities did: As far as we know, Seattle's was the only record to fall. It wasn't quite an area-wide heat wave -- the coast and areas along the Strait of Juan de Fuca and the northern islands only reached the 70s. To wit, Port Angeles only hit 71, while Oak Harbor was at 67 and it was the mid 70s along the coast. For those new to the area over the winter and aren't familiar with how Seattle heat waves go, we're a bit lucky in when we do get hot around here, it's more of a desert-dry heat than a humid Midwestern heat. To get hot here, we have to hold back the cool, ocean air, and the way to do that is to have an east wind. But as an added effect, as that air comes from the east and sinks down the Cascade Mountains, it gets warmer and drier. To wit: humidities today are in the 15-30% range. We're also lucky in the sense that it's difficult for heat waves to last too long -- typically 2-3 days at the most, and rarely four days -- because eventually that thermal trough will move off to our east, the west wind will overpower the east wind and kick in what we call our "natural air conditioning." And, lo and behold, our "natural air conditioning" is set to get going tonight -- although it'll be on the "low" setting. For Thursday, we're expecting another sunny day, but somewhat cooler as we get more of a light marine wind instead of the warmer offshore wind. Highs will drop to the upper 70s around Seattle, and low 80s in the warmer spots. A much bigger change will be felt along the coast and along the Strait of Juan de Fuca, where the marine air will be more influential. Highs there will drop back to the 60s there. Friday is looking about the same for highs -- maybe a few degrees cooler as we could see brief period of morning clouds, but sunshine for a vast majority of the day. We might actually bounce up a few degrees to the low 80s for Saturday as the marine flow weakens again. The flow turns to the south for late Saturday into Sunday in advance of a front that will be approaching offshore. That is a recipe for adding a muggy feel to the air and perhaps touching off a few showers or thunderstorms over the Cascades that could drift over the lowlands. So far, we're thinking most will stay dry, but this will bear watching and we'll toss a few drops on the extended forecast for now. Temperatures will cool a bit for Sunday but might feel warmer with the humidity. Rain returns for Monday, and then dry and cool (well, relatively cool. Actually, it's about normal) for Tuesday and Wednesday amid partly sunny skies and highs in the upper 60s before rain returns for the end of the week. Maybe the perfect time to catch up on some of the real May blockbusters?
http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7756807.html Commission approves renewed gray whale hunting by Makahs approves renewed gray whale hunting by Makahs PM PDT PORT ANGELES, Wash. (AP) - The Makah Tribe of Washington state has won approval by the International Whaling Commission for renewed subsistence hunting of gray whales, although the issue remains tied up in the courts. The panel, meeting in Anchorage, Alaska, voted Tuesday to allow the Makahs to kill up to 20 whales in the next five years. Subsistence hunts also were approved for aboriginal groups in Alaska and Russia. The tribe still needs a waiver from the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act before conducting another gray whale hunt, so commission approval was largely a symbolic victory, Tribal Council member Micah McCarty told radio station KONP of Port Angeles. In the commission-sanctioned resumption of a centuries-old tribal tradition in 1999, the Makahs killed their first gray whale in 70 years. After two unsuccessful family hunts in 2000, the issue became ensnarled in legal wrangling.
http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7757162.html 'Basically I tell him to wake up. He's got to wake up.' I tell him to wake up. He's got to wake up.' PM PDT A mother is trying to make sense of a tragedy that took three lives and left her son in a coma. A drunk, wrong-way driver hit Joline Heldt's son, Sean Heldt. He doesn't know yet that his girlfriend was killed in the crash. Sean's family is holding his hand, talking to him. He's still deep in a coma, induced to keep down swelling on his brain. Joline still does the talks to her son. "Basically I tell him to wake up. He's got to wake up," she said. Joline whispers those words, believing her can hear her through all the tubes, casts and the fog of medication. "He's got to come out of this so he can see his son, and be around to raise his son," she said. The drunk driver almost hit Sgt. J.P. McAuliffe before slamming head-on into Sean's car. McAuliffe talked to a witness. "She said 'you just missed him, he just hit a car head-on', and it's the worst thing I've seen in my life." The drunk driver was going the wrong way on I-90 over Snoqualmie pass. Sean's girlfriend Christina Grimsley died in the collision, along with the intoxicated driver,Nicholas Curtis, and his two-year-old son. Grimsley's daughter, who was in a child seat, survived. Sean's son wasn't in the car. "With the kind of injury Sean ended up with, two cars colliding at 70 miles an hour, there's bound to be injuries, brain damage," Joline said. It's the reality Joline faces. She faces it with the belief the son she remembers will open his eyes again. "I have to believe he's going to come out of it, because if I don't have the hope he will, why even come," she said. State troopers are urging witnesses of the accident to contact them. Sean's families asking for help too. He's not insured. There is a fund set up under his name at all U.S. Bank locations.
