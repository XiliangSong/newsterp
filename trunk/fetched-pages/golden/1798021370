http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/uk/6699305.stm | UK 'must pay more for emissions' 28 May 2007, 23:13 GMT 00:13 'must pay more for emissions' The UK must pay more for the damage it does, Oxfam says The UK must donate more money to poorer countries to help them cope with climate change, according to a charity. Oxfam said Britain had pledged £20m in "adaptation funds" - but needed to pay a further £1.2bn. They reached the figure by combining the amount of emissions a country produces with its ability to pay. The government said it was spending "more money than ever" to lift people out of poverty and make them less vulnerable to climate change. In the run-up to next month's G8 summit in Germany, Oxfam warned that £25bin was needed to fund projects in poor countries. But the world's richest nations have so far pledged only £90m in total, the charity said. The UK has pledged at least £75 million to support adaptation directly Its report concluded developed countries should foot 80% of the bill for poorer countries to adapt. Oxfam's Kate Raworth said: "Rich countries are already making huge investments at home to adapt to climate change - so they know the scale of the problem. "But they are stalling when it comes to providing money for poorer countries to do the same." She said developing countries "cannot and should not be expected to foot the bill for the impact of rich countries' emissions". The UK is already the world's biggest contributor to adaptation projects. But the charity said the UK should pay 5% of the £25bn needed. A spokesman for the Department for International Development (DfID) the UK was "at the forefront of supporting poor countries adapt". "The UK has pledged at least £75m to support adaptation directly. "For example, at the grassroots level we are investing in schemes such as safer flood resistant housing for thousands of people in Bangladesh." He said "more work needs to be done" to work out exactly how rich nations help poorer ones to adapt to climate change. plea to Blair over Africa 11 Mar 07 | UK Stars donate to Darfur aid sale 24 Apr 07 | Entertainment Department for International Development in anti-terror targets Stop-smoking drug approved on NHS
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/6704091.stm | South of Scotland | Sightings hope for rare farm bird 30 May 2007, 12:16 GMT 13:16 hope for rare farm bird The corn bunting is thought to have returned to the Borders - picture by Tom Marshall A small group of rare farmland birds has been found in the Borders - years after conservationists believed that just one of them remained in the area. The corn bunting - known as the "fat bird of the barley" - was once a common sight across Scotland and the UK. In recent decades, however, its numbers had fallen due to changes in traditional farming practices. Conservationists have urged the public to call them if the large, sparrow-like bird is spotted in the region. Small populations of the corn bunting still exist in eastern Scotland and the Western Isles. The corn bunting may not be the most colourful of birds, but as it often perches conspicuously on wires such as telephone lines or fences when singing, it can be easily spotted It was thought that its fate in the Borders had been sealed after a single calling male was reported by a landowner in the Lamberton area in 2003. However, this month Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) officers - with the help of a local volunteer and landowner - discovered two singing male corn buntings and a presumed female at a site in the eastern Borders. The find has raised hopes that the species may yet see a recovery in the region. The public and farmers in particular, have been asked to keep an eye out for the rare birds, which are easily noted by their distinctive song and behaviour. "The corn bunting may not be the most colourful of birds, but as it often perches conspicuously on wires such as telephone lines or fences when singing, it can be easily spotted," said Lisa Webb of the RSPB. "The song of the corn bunting has been likened to jangling a set of keys, and is quite different to the smaller and more colourful yellowhammer." A recording of the song and images of the bird have been placed on the RSPB's website. sounded for farmland birds 18 Aug 06 | Science/Nature Stooks 'vital' to bird's survival 04 Aug 06 | Highlands and Islands Farmers urged to help rare bird 08 Feb 06 | Humber UK birds 'hit by climate change' 19 Aug 05 | UK SOUTH OF SCOTLAND STORIES Nightclub visit for death inquiry Body discovered in burned out car Road reopening halted by badgers
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6703001.stm at Greenland whale plan 29 May 2007, 23:36 GMT 00:36 at Greenland whale plan Environment correspondent, BBC News website, Anchorage, Alaska Greenland wants to include humpbacks in its annual hunt The International Whaling Commission (IWC) annual meeting has seen deadlock on its second day over Greenland's plans to expand its Inuit whale hunt. But proposals from indigenous groups in the US, Caribbean and Russia passed. Subsistence whaling rights are given to groups with traditional whaling culture and a nutritional need for whale meat. On the sidelines, Japan met with anti-whaling nations to try to resolve differences over its plan to include humpbacks in its Antarctic hunt. The plan has caused outrage in Australia and New Zealand, which have healthy whale-watching industries with humpbacks as their star turn. Subsistence (aboriginal) hunting is a relatively uncontroversial issue, with most governments and activist groups supporting the notion that indigenous peoples should be entitled to catch whales on a not-for-profit basis, despite the 21-year global moratorium on commercial hunting. Actress Miranda Richardson supports a total ban Quotas are reviewed every five years, and this meeting is supposed to set allowances for the period 2008-12. But the West Greenland bid proved unusually controversial. It wanted to increase the number of minke whales taken from 175 to 200, and include 10 humpbacks and 2 bowhead whales for the first time. Guide to the Great Whales Greenland Inuit delegate Amalie Jessen said her people had demonstrated a need for 730 tonnes of whale meat each year rather than the current 450 tonnes. "We like to see whales alive as well, but we see hunting them as an important part of our cultural life," she said. Scientists advising the IWC believed there was not enough reliable information available to assess humpback stocks in the target region. "We can only support a quota that's scientifically based," said Netherlands commissioner Giuseppe Raaphorst. "On the scientific basis and the precautionary principle, we cannot accept this proposal." But with pro-whaling nations amassing behind the Greenland bid, a decision was deferred. The other bids, from the Chukchi of north-eastern Russia, Alaskan Eskimos, the Makah tribe of Washington State in the US, and the Beqians of St Vincent and the Grenadines, involved maintaining existing quotas, and passed without problem. The fiercest row currently concerns Japan's plan to add 50 humpback whales to its annual Antarctic hunt, which it conducts in the name of scientific research. Before the meeting started, Japan offered to consider abandoning the humpback element if the anti-whaling bloc could consider its request to allow limited commercial hunting by four coastal communities. The offer was dismissed instantly; but Japanese commissioners met informally with ministers from anti-whaling countries Australia, the UK and New Zealand in an attempt to find a way forward. After the session, New Zealand's conservation minister Chris Carter told BBC News that they had agreed to continue talking, with the future of the IWC one item on which it might be possible to find common ground. However, he said, the Japanese coastal whaling proposal would not be endorsed, while his government's opposition to the humpback hunt remained as implacable as ever. Japanese delegates declined to comment.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6693879.stm ahead crucial for Mars rover 25 May 2007, 21:21 GMT 22:21 ahead crucial for Mars rover Science reporter, BBC News The robotic rover mission is set to be launched in 2013 Talks to resolve the design of Europe's rover mission to Mars are converging on a "best solution for science", a senior space official has told the BBC. The option in question would require an upgrade to the original vision. But observers fear some European Space Agency (Esa) delegates could still baulk at the enormous costs of an enhanced mission. It will test the resolve of member states to avoid the unthinkable - killing off the flagship project. Abandoning the ExoMars mission would be a public relations catastrophe for the space agency, raising serious questions over Europe's space capability. The robotic rover mission is set to be launched to the Red Planet in 2013. The general consensus was positive and recognising the need to have much more science return from the mission Esa ExoMars team member The top-level panel from Esa member states, including the UK, is being asked by agency scientists to approve an upgraded - and much more expensive - design to that originally proposed. It would see ExoMars travel with an orbiter to relay data back to Earth. This would free the mission from reliance on US spacecraft for communications with home, and would allow the rover to wait in orbit for Martian dust storms to subside before landing on the Red Planet. The option would require the whole package to be launched on a bigger, more powerful rocket, meaning the robotic vehicle could also carry additional, or heavier, science instruments to search for life. ExoMars is one stage in an ambitious European programme of planetary exploration - called Aurora - which is geared eventually to include a mission to return samples of Martian soil to Earth. Delegates from Esa member states have been meeting this week in Paris to agree a final configuration so that industrial partners can move ahead on the project. Bruno Gardini, a member of Esa's ExoMars project team, said that "opinion was converging" on the beefed-up mission design. "We are moving in that direction," he told BBC News. "The general consensus was positive and recognising the need to have much more science return from the mission. But taking a decision takes a little bit of time and consultation. "There has of course been discussion on all possible alternatives. But I think at the end, the opinion of the present participants was - I would dare to say - converging because of the scientific return." Delegates will now meet again on 11 June in an attempt to reach formal agreement on the mission's configuration. An important meeting to hammer out the financial details of the proposal is scheduled for later this year. For months, scientific and industrial groups across Europe have been developing a number of concepts in parallel. The Ariane 5 would have the power to launch an upgraded mission The early "baseline option" called for a rover to be launched on a Soyuz-Fregat booster and landed on Mars using bouncing gas bags. In this original configuration, the 650m-euro rover would have the capacity to carry 8kg of instrumentation, including a drill to burrow beneath the Martian soil. A Geophysics/Environment Package (GEP) would also be sent with the rover. This fixed station, once placed on the planet's surface, could sense "Marsquakes" and monitor weather. But the bouncing bags would put tight constraints on the volume of space into which the rover must be stowed. This in turn restricts the maximum mass that can be given over to instruments and makes it impossible to carry a meaningful GEP payload. Discontent was also expressed over intentions to use American orbiting spacecraft at Mars to relay commands and data. If the US were to experience a spacecraft failure - as happened last year - ExoMars could be compromised. Design teams have therefore been considering the enhanced concept that would see the rover launched on a heavy lift Ariane 5 or a Proton rocket. "We need a decision on the technical content of the work, otherwise it is not efficient anymore," said Bruno Gardini. David Parker, from the UK delegation on Esa's Programme Board for Human Spaceflight, Microgravity and Exploration, said: "There are future meetings over the coming weeks and months, to try to find the definite way forward on the ExoMars mission." Of the heavy lift option, he said: "That was Esa's recommendation and was presented to us in real time. Now we have to go back home and reflect and think about it." Some commentators, however, have been worried the extra costs of the beefed-up design - amounting to tens of millions of euros - could force some delegates into turning their backs on the mission. But to abandon ExoMars now would make a mockery of Esa's planetary exploration programme. It would also knock back a generation of scientists who have pinned their hopes on the Aurora roadmap to deliver a mission to bring back Martian soil and rocks for study in laboratories on Earth. Late last year, the launch of ExoMars was pushed back from 2011 to December 2013. With a launch in 2011, ExoMars would have spent two years in a heliocentric orbit before reaching its target. The mission will now make a direct transfer to Mars, which takes less time to get to the Red Planet. But it will now arrive in September 2014, during a period of global dust storms. Without an orbiter, the rover would have to land in the midst of these storms, a risk Esa says it is unwilling to take. moon 'could be key test' Frozen sea may harbour Mars life Hardy bug re-opens Mars debate Water 'flowed recently' on Mars Probe spies landers on Red Planet European Mars launch delayed Rover may get one-way ticket Mars rover takes in crater view Q&A: Nasa's Mars orbiter How to take pictures of Mars Mars Express mission briefing Full in depth report 37th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference European Space Agency, Aurora Programme
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6699463.stm | Scientists find bird flu antibody 29 May 2007, 04:09 GMT 05:09 find bird flu antibody It's hoped human trials of the bird flu antibody could begin soon Antibodies that could protect against bird flu in humans have been isolated by an international team of scientists. The discovery could lead to treatments that complement flu vaccines in the event of a human epidemic of the virus. The H5N1 bird flu virus is estimated to have killed more than 180 people around the world since 2003. Some countries are already stockpiling vaccines for a possible bird flu outbreak in humans, but no one knows how effective they might be. This is because the particular strain of bird flu that might eventually spark a human pandemic is unknown. But scientists working in Switzerland, Vietnam and the United States say they have isolated antibodies that they hope could offer protection against several different strains of the virus simultaneously. Antibodies are used by our immune system to neutralise bacteria and viruses - in this case, the scientists have isolated antibodies that bird flu survivors in Vietnam produced to fight off the disease. Professor Antonio Lanzavecchia, at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine in Switzerland, says the antibodies have already proven effective in the lab and in mice and he is confident that they could be used in humans. "We in a way exploit the immune response of an individual who has been infected and has survived the infection and of course has made antibodies that neutralise these viruses," he said. "And using this technique, we can isolate the cells that make these antibodies so that this antibody can now be reproduced in vitro and eventually massively produced to treat other individuals." The antibodies could be used to protect key workers, such as nurses and doctors, in countries where a bird flu epidemic strikes. The researchers say it could also be used as an emergency antidote in people who have already been infected with bird flu - if administered within a few days. It is hoped human trials could begin shortly. ban ends 'way of life' Japan confirms bird flu outbreak WHO chief issues bird flu warning Vietnam warned on bird flu threat Clues to pandemic bird flu found Watch how the lethal virus has spread Bird flu: Still a threat?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6687129.stm suggest dinos could swim 24 May 2007, 13:37 GMT 14:37 suggest dinos could swim The shape of the scratch marks suggested the beast was swimming Ancient footprints have provided compelling evidence that some dinosaurs were able to swim, scientists report. The 15m (50ft) trackway that reveals one animal's underwater odyssey was discovered in the Cameros Basin in Spain, once a vast lake. The S-shaped prints suggest the beast clawed at sediment on the lake floor as it swam in about 3m (10ft) of water. The marks are about 125 million years old, dating to the Early Cretaceous, the team writes in the journal Geology. They were left by a large, bipedal, carnivorous dinosaur. "We came across them about three or four years ago," explained Dr Loic Costeur, a palaeontologist at the University of Nantes, France, and a co-author of the paper. "The Cameros Basin has thousands of walking footprints from diverse dinosaur fauna, but when we saw these it was obvious straightaway that this was a swimming dinosaur." The underwater trackway, which is well-preserved in sandstone, is made up of 12 consecutive prints each consisting of two to three scratch marks. "The footprints are really peculiar in their shape and morphology - they are not at all like walking footprints," Dr Costeur told the BBC News website. "In walking footprints, you can recognise the shape of the foot; but here it is not at all the case: it is sets of grooves on the sediment surface. The marks were made about 125 million years ago "You get the idea that the animals' body was supported by water as it was scratching the sediment." Ripple marks around the track suggested the dinosaur was swimming against a current, attempting to keep a straight path, the team said. Further investigation of the well-preserved track revealed more about the beast's swimming style. "The dinosaur swam with alternating movements of the two hind limbs: a pelvic paddle swimming motion," said Dr Costeur. "It is a swimming style of amplified walking with movements similar to those used by modern bipeds, including aquatic birds." For many years, the question of whether dinosaurs were able to swim remained unanswered. Investigations into dinosaur anatomy and ecology suggested it was possible, but very little hard evidence existed documenting this behaviour. But Dr Costeur described the find as "extremely exciting" and said it provided the first compelling evidence that dinosaurs were able to swim. "The trackway at La Virgen del Campo opens the door to several new areas of research," said Costeur. "New biomechanical modelling will increase our understanding of dinosaur physiology and physical capabilities, as well as our view of the ecological niches in which they lived." reptile fossil examined 06 Jan 04 | Cambridgeshire Giant sea fossil unearthed 30 Dec 02 | Sci/Tech
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6701515.stm cheetahs caught by DNA 29 May 2007, 23:48 GMT 00:48 cheetahs caught by DNA Science and technology reporter, BBC News Infidelity is not common among other big cats The female cheetahs that prowl the Serengeti in Tanzania appear to live up to their name, scientists have shown. DNA analysis of the spotted cats found that they were serial cheaters, with nearly half of their litters made up of cubs from different fathers. Writing in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the scientists say the infidelity may expose them to disease. However, it could also ensure the genetic diversity of the endangered species, the researchers hypothesise. "If the cubs are genetically more variable it may allow them to adapt and evolve to different circumstances," Dada Gottelli of the Zoological Society of London (ZSL) and one of the scientists on the study told the BBC News website. "If there is a big change in the environment some may be able to cope better." ) are classified as a vulnerable species according to the World Conservation Union (IUCN). The effective breeding population is estimated to be below 10,000 individuals and the species faces threats including habitat loss and poaching. The new research tracked known cheetahs in the Serengeti National Park in north-west Tanzania over nine years. Analysis of DNA collected from the faecal samples of 176 cheetahs showed that infidelity was rife, although uncommon in other big cats. Researchers tracked the cheetahs for nine years. Of 47 litters of cubs, 43% contained cubs from multiple fathers. In some cases, three males were of just one litter. "If anything, this is an underestimate," said Ms Gotelli. "Cheetah cubs suffer high mortality on the first few weeks so it was difficult to get samples from all of them." Female cheetahs are able to successfully mate with multiple males as they produce a new egg each time they mate, a process known as induced ovulation Common in domestic cats and other species such as rabbits, it means that each egg can in theory be fertilised by sperm from a different male. The high incidence of promiscuity among females coupled with the fact that they increase their risk of predation, parasites and disease to mate with multiple males suggests that there must be a benefit to the behaviour. The researchers believe the evolutionary pay-off is increased genetic diversity, allowing some of the cubs to more readily adapt to change. This is good news for conservationists trying to preserve the threatened species as small populations of animals can face problems of inbreeding. However, the duplicitous behaviour may also bring other benefits such as protecting the cubs from marauding males. "Infanticide has not been observed in the wild cheetahs, like it has been in lions and leopards," said Ms Gotelli. "Maybe this is why. "It may create confusion in the males. In that case it's better not to kill any cubs in case they were yours." sparks 'male rivalry' 25 Apr 06 | Health 25 Sep 98 | Sci/Tech Zoological Society of London
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6688649.stm spring 'affecting wildlife' 25 May 2007, 05:08 GMT 06:08 spring 'affecting wildlife' The survey shows some species are appearing earlier than expected A warm spring has brought about the early arrival of some UK wildlife, the first results of the Springwatch 2007 survey suggest. Over the past few months, amateur naturalists have logged more than 24,000 first sightings of six key species of plants and animals. Some, such as the peacock butterfly and frogspawn, have been spotted earlier than expected. The Woodland Trust said it was worried "because the changes are so rapid". See when the wildlife was first spotted Springwatch, now in its third year, is run by the Woodland Trust and the BBC. The first sightings of swifts have not changed by much The survey data is being compiled to build up a picture of the season as it unfolds across the UK so that it can be compared to previous years. As the survey has been running for a limited time, the results cannot be interpreted as definitive guide to how a changing climate is affecting wildlife, but researchers are already examining the data for trends. Recent weather in the UK has been extremely mild, and records show it has been the warmest spring since the Springwatch survey began in 2005. Most computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader Download the reader here Nick Collinson, head of conservation policy at the Woodland Trust, believes the warm conditions may be responsible for some earlier-than-expected sightings. He said: "This has been our earliest Springwatch year, well ahead of the normal time we would have expected to see these events 30 years ago." Members of the public were asked to record the dates they have first seen red-tailed bumblebees, frogspawn, flowering hawthorns, seven-spot ladybirds, peacock butterflies and swifts. Some of the preliminary findings of this year's survey include: Frogspawn spotted on average two weeks earlier than in 2006 and three weeks earlier than the "phenological norm" (an average first-sighting date based on data gathered over the last 30 years). Peacock butterflies sighted on average one month earlier than 2006, two weeks earlier than 2005, and one month earlier than the norm. For swifts, the data is still returning, but initial results suggest the date has stayed much the same as 2006, 2007 and the phenological norm. Mr Collinson was worried about the possible impact of increasingly warm springs. He said: "We are concerned because the change seems to be so rapid. "And we know there is a mismatch of timing, so, for example, when insects would pollinate flowers, the flowers are coming out earlier than the insects are available, and we know this is happening. "It is very difficult to tell what that means, but certainly we know that wildlife is under pressure."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6703679.stm | HSBC in $100m climate initiative 30 May 2007, 23:34 GMT 00:34 in $100m climate initiative More than 400 million people reliant on major rivers are under threat HSBC is setting aside $100m (£50m) for an initiative to tackle climate change. The funding by the UK's largest bank will help charities and environmental groups to research some of the global causes and effects of climate change. The partnership will look at ways to protect the world's most important rivers and identify how cities can respond to environmental threats. HSBC also said it would create "a green taskforce", to ensure climate awareness was central to its own business. HSBC is the latest UK company to pledge changes to the way it operates in the face of calls for big business to do more to prioritise environmental concerns. HSBC is teaming up with climate campaigners the Climate Group, environmental groups the Earthwatch Institute and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI), and the conservation charity WWF in a five-year partnership We believe we can tackle the causes and impacts of climate change HSBC chairman Stephen Green Banking on green gestures? HSBC, which will spend $5m of the $100m on managing the project, said it would enable the four bodies to expand their climate-related research and undertake work in new countries such as China and India. Priorities include conducting research into the impact of climate change on the world's largest forests and improving management of freshwater systems to increase water security. "By working with four of the world's most respected environmental organisations, we believe we can tackle the causes and impacts of climate change," said Stephen Green, HSBC chairman. The Climate Group said its funding would be used to speed up action against global warming in five of the world's most polluted cities - London, New York, Hong Kong, Mumbai and Shanghai. "Many of the solutions lie in cities," said its chief executive Steve Howard. "We have a short period of time left to take action." The partnership is modelled on a previous five-year, HSBC-funded environmental campaign, which ended last year. This $50m initiative helped save 12,000 plant species from extinction, according to the firm. In conjunction with the donation, HSBC has launched an internal plan to educate its workers on the issues of climate change, at an estimated further cost of $8m. An online module about global warming has been launched and is accessible to the firm's 312,000 employees. "Over the next five years HSBC will make responding to climate change central to our business operations and at the heart of the way we work with our clients," said Mr Green. However, the initiative does not mark a change in the bank's lending policies. Mr Green said pulling out of "sensitive" sectors, including mining, chemicals, energy, forestry and energy, "would not be the right decision". The firm declared itself carbon neutral in 2005, mainly by investing in offsetting schemes. HSBC saw its own emissions rise by 23% in 2006, largely due to acquisitions, explained Jon Williams, head of group sustainable development. out how the greenhouse effect works and more...

Felix Dodds and Richard Sherman At a recent United Nations debate, the UK argued that the Security Council should take a central role in responding to climate change. But, ask Felix Dodds and Richard Sherman in this week's Green Room, is this yet another way for rich nations to protect their own borders and interests? This UN debate on energy, security and climate... can definitely be seen as a historic event Send us your comments While governments are preoccupied with negotiations on future international action when the Kyoto Protocol's first commitment period expires in 2012, a more recent debate held in the UN Security Council elevated the climate struggle to a new level. Central were the weighty questions: is climate change a threat to international peace and security, and, if so, does the Security Council have a role to play in generating intergovernmental consensus on a global response? This UN debate on energy, security and climate, which took place on 17 April, can definitely be seen as a historic event - and might, by some, even be seen as an evolutionary step in the climate debate. However, it also highlighted the continued polarisation surrounding climate change that exists between member states, and failed to conclude with a consensus on climate insecurity. One view, pronounced by the UK's Foreign Secretary Margaret Beckett, supported by EU colleagues, was that the Security Council's mandate to address issues that threaten the international peace and security was indeed broad enough to encompass the impacts of climate change. "What makes wars start?" she asked. Fights over water, changing patterns of rainfall, fights over food production, land use...There are few greater potential threats to our economies too...but also to peace and security itself." However, developing countries strongly objected to the Security Council playing a role in climate change compliance and scrutiny. And the debate, coming at a time when tensions between industrialised and developing countries over the encroachment of the unrepresentative Security Council over the more democratic and representative UN General Assembly, may in fact exacerbate the political divide between rich and poor. For many developing countries, the decision by the UK presidency of the Security Council to hold a debate on climate and energy security held undertones of an inequitable response by the industrialised nations, such as the US and other global powers, most responsible for climate change. Many disagreed with Margaret Beckett They argued that perhaps the rich and powerful were seeking to protect their own interests by utilising an undemocratic process to address a global problem in which the majority of the world's citizens are innocent bystanders. Farukh Amil, the deputy permanent representative for Pakistan and chair of the group of 77 developing countries, made some powerful arguments against the inclusion of climate change in the Security Council. While recognising the importance of the issues for the achievement of sustainable development, developing countries felt the responsibilities to address the climate and security nexus were the responsibility of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. Mr Amil argued that climate change already has a binding multilateral agreement, the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), as well as the Kyoto Protocol. "No role was envisaged for the Security Council," he said. Stakeholders and climate activists were equally divided. The conservation group WWF called on the Security Council to initiate a global cooperative energy and climate strategy. Other NGOs, including our organisation Stakeholder Forum, opposed the issue being discussed at the Security Council. We argued that it was wrong as it excluded over 180 countries; and of the council's permanent five members, four are developed countries which one might consider to be interested in securing their energy and climate requirements. The question is not whether climate change is a threat to international peace and security, but more about how and where the world should have a discussion on how to address these issues Send us your comments The Security Council also excludes the input of stakeholders who bring to the table experiences at the local level and case studies of what works and doesn't. There is no question that we are starting to discuss a new paradigm of human and environmental security of which climate and energy security is an important part - but not the only part. Health epidemics, post-conflict reconstruction, nuclear weapons, migration, population growth, unsustainable consumption, poverty and trade are all also part of the discussion we need to look at through this new lens. The question is not whether climate change is a threat to international peace and security, but more about how and where the world should have a discussion on addressing these issues creatively. There are already good examples of how to create global conversations: the Earth Summit processes of the 1990s are one. In 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, the Earth Summit looked at the interface between environment and development; and in 2002, the Johannesburg Earth Summit looked at sustainable development. We are now seeing the emergence of this new paradigm because developed governments have not delivered on their Rio and Johannesburg commitments. Not because the conversation was wrong about what needed to be done - it just wasn't delivered. By 2012, 20 years from Rio, we need another Earth Summit this time on human and environmental security. If we don't, then the agenda of sustainable development will be dictated by the security concerns bringing major impacts on our lives and our democracies.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6694227.stm 'opposes' G8 climate proposals 26 May 2007, 03:37 GMT 04:37 'opposes' G8 climate proposals Developing economies are at major risk from climate change The US appears to have rejected draft proposals by Germany for G8 members to agree tough measures in greenhouse gas emissions, leaked documents have shown. Wide-ranging US amendments to a draft communique prepared ahead of June's G8 in Germany summit cite a "fundamental opposition" to the proposals. Germany wants all G8 members to agree timetables and targets for major cuts. Greenpeace, who leaked the document, said it showed UK PM Tony Blair failed to persuade the US to alter its stance. In the document, US officials make major changes to the communique. In comments printed in red ink, the US negotiators express disappointment that earlier concerns have not been taken on board. We have tried to 'tread lightly' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position US comments on leaked communique The changes strike out entire sentences and significantly reduce the certainty with which the statement addresses climate change. "The US still has serious, fundamental concerns about this draft statement," a red-inked note reads. "The treatment of climate change runs counter to our overall position and crosses 'multiple red lines' in terms of what we simply cannot agree to," it continues. "We have tried to 'tread lightly' but there is only so far we can go given our fundamental opposition to the German position." However, in Washington, senior US lawmakers have written to President Bush expressing their dismay at the administration's position, the AFP news agency reports. Correspondents say the document hints at a looming struggle over the issue of climate change at the G8 summit, to be held on 6-8 June in Heiligendamm, Germany. Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to use Germany's presidency of the G8 to secure a major climate change deal, including: Agreement to slow the rise in average temperatures this century to 2C A cut in global emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050 A rise in energy efficiency in power and transport by 20% by 2020. Greenpeace Director John Sauven described the US position as "criminal". "The US administration is clearly ignoring the global scientific consensus as well the groundswell of concern about climate change in the United States," he said. Mrs Merkel should make it clear the US was isolated on the issue among G8 members, he added. Speaking on 24 May, British Prime Minister Tony Blair suggested the US could be on the verge of altering its climate policy. The US has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which sets out targets for lowering emissions until 2012. "I can't think that there's going to be many people running for presidential office next time round in the US who aren't going to have climate change in their programme," said Mr Blair. "I think it is possible that we will see action - and at least the beginnings of that action at the G8 - I hope so. That's what I'm arguing for."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6706607.stm for warbler population 31 May 2007, 02:44 GMT 03:44 for warbler population Restoring heathlands is vital to the warblers' recovery, say the RSPB A vulnerable bird is experiencing an extraordinary population revival in the UK, RSPB figures have indicated. The latest survey of Dartford warblers shows that numbers have soared by 70% since the last count in 1994. The bird is vulnerable to changes in climate and two harsh winters left just 11 pairs of the bird in 1963. It has returned to Wales, the Midlands and East Anglia and now there are more than 3,000 pairs - the highest tally for more than 40 years. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds says the recent rise in numbers - to an estimated 3,208 pairs from 1,890 in 1994 - is due both to milder winters and improvements in the conservation of heathland habitats. But campaigners say more work is needed to protect and restore heathlands in order to cement the warbler's recovery. The warbler has been returning to its former ranges "This survey is fantastic news for a very vulnerable bird, particularly because it has moved to higher ground not used by Dartford warblers for many years," said Simon Wotton, research biologist at the RSPB. "Warmer winters mean the birds are likely to push even further north but they can only do that if there are heathland sites available, which are protected from development. "If the government is to help wildlife adapt to climate change it should be assigning more land for the creation of habitats to help birds like these." But the bird remains vulnerable in some areas of its range and, on the Thames Basin heaths in Berkshire, Hampshire and Surrey, numbers fell by 40% from 2005 to 2006. The reasons for this remain unclear. The RSPB said the losses emphasised the importance of protection and management of the warbler's existing strongholds. It says the creation of new heathland sites is vital to help Dartford warblers expand their range. The Dartford warbler survey was a joint effort between the RSPB, Natural England, Forestry Commission England and The British Trust for Ornithology.

The organisation, which certifies which foods are organic, says it is looking at a number of proposals because of concern about greenhouse gas emissions. It will outline a series of options, including an outright ban, in a consultation document next week. Other proposals include labels showing a product's country of origin as well as carbon offsetting schemes. Flying produce into Britain from abroad is the fastest growing form of food transport. Organic food grown in this country is taken to the supermarket by horse and cart I suppose? Send us your comments And the Soil Association says highly perishable or out-of-season produce make up the bulk of air-freighted organic produce. But due to growing demands to cut the environmental impact of food distribution, the organisation is now considering five options to reduce the carbon footprint of air-freighted food. These include a campaign to partially or fully deny food imported into the UK by air the right to label itself organic and comprehensive labelling showing a product's country of origin as well as the air miles it has travelled. However, the Soil Association says that air transport can help developing countries with poor infrastructure to get their goods to markets. And any decision would have to take into account the impact on farmers in the developing world, it added. A snap survey of the major supermarkets by the BBC's Breakfast programme found some organic versions of seasonal fruit and vegetables had been imported from as far away as Thailand and Argentina.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6690191.stm | Blair: US may back carbon deal 25 May 2007, 00:58 GMT 01:58 US may back carbon deal Germany has made climate a priority for the G8 presidency The US may be willing to back an agreement at next month's G8 summit on cutting carbon dioxide emissions, Tony Blair has said on BBC TV. Up to now, the Bush administration has championed voluntary agreements as an alternative to imposing binding caps. Germany has made climate change a priority for its G8 presidency. The prime minister said awareness of the issue among Americans was growing and it was possible the US will sign up to "at least the beginnings" of action. Last September, California became the first US state to set targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Speaking on the BBC's Newsnight programme, Mr Blair was asked how he was going to persuade President George W Bush to agree to national impose limits on CO2. "You've got several of the states now doing it," Mr Blair said. For the first time, at least the Americans are in this "I can't think that there's going to be many people running for presidential office next time round in the US who aren't going to have climate change in their programme." He added: "I think it is possible that we will see action - and at least the beginnings of that action at the G8 - I hope so. That's what I'm arguing for." Mr Blair's comments on Newsnight came after the G8 countries, together with China, India, Mexico, Brazil and South Africa, have been holding talks on emissions. "For the first time, at least the Americans are in this G8 plus 5 process," Mr Blair said. But only last week a UN-hosted meeting ended with the US indicating it was unlikely to take part in negotiations at the end of this year on a global agreement to cut emissions. And according to documents seen by the BBC, the US is trying to block sections of a draft agreement on climate change prepared for the G8 summit. Washington is said to object to the targets to keep the global temperature rise below 2C this century and halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6689541.stm the whaling debate forward 25 May 2007, 09:46 GMT 10:46 the whaling debate forward By the Rt Hon Sir Geoffrey Palmer The debate over commercial whaling is brought to the table once again at the International Whaling Commission's annual meeting. But, Geoffrey Palmer argues in this week's Green Room, there may be ways to avoid the usual stalemate. It is devoutly to be hoped that light rather than heat emerges from that discussion Send us your comments Guide to the Great Whales Since the commercial whaling moratorium went into effect in 1986, more than 29,000 whales have been killed under objection and special permit whaling. The Japanese government issues special permits, as it is able to do under the whaling convention, allowing hunting for scientific research; Norway and Iceland use an International Whaling Commission (IWC) regulation allowing exemptions from the moratorium. For nearly 15 years the IWC annual meetings have been dominated by discussions on how to devise a scheme that allows commercial whaling to resume but properly protects the stocks. A 75% majority is required in order for commercial whaling to resume under the whaling convention. But at present, the IWC member nations are divided over this issue. One block of nations wishes to see commercial whaling resume even if those nations do not engage in it. Another block does not want to see commercial whaling resume under any circumstances. A middle group wants a compromise to be reached. Debate has been highly divisive and anything but diplomatic. No agreement has been reached. This debate has now become so intense that efforts are being made to cast around for solutions. The Pew Charitable Trusts, with the support of the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep), sponsored a meeting at the UN in April, in New York, entitled Symposium on the State of the Conservation of Whales in the 21st Century, which I chaired. The meeting had representation from around the world and had about equal numbers of people with IWC experience, NGO experience, and environmental experience but not with whales. This mix did turn out to produce new perspectives. For two days, participants in the conference looked at four main themes: the state of whale stocks and the science relating to them developments in international ocean law diplomatic means that may be available to address the impasse suggestions for the future What emerged from these deliberations was a menu of options that may offer a way forward. One block of nations wishes to see commercial whaling resume No coalition of views around any single option emerged, but new suggestions were made that had not been heard before. Many are worthy of further exploration. There was a view that the current arrangements, contentious as they are, may be the best available means of protecting whales. According to that view, present policy settings should be maintained and efforts should be made to continue a further conservation agenda within the IWC. Indeed, throughout the conference, there were no suggestions that the IWC could be dispensed with, although there were many ideas on how to cure its afflictions. Pro-conservation countries consult with their pro-conservation NGOs One of these was that a number of changes should be made to the whaling convention in order to remove or restrict the use of scientific whaling. Another was to have better enforcement of the convention with a new dispute settlement provision and no capacity to make reservations to the new rules or opt out. There were suggestions that commercial whaling should resume on a limited basis, provided that scientific whaling is abandoned and there is a ban on the international trade in whale meat. Whaling in sanctuaries (large areas where whales are protected by a decision of the International Whaling Commission, such as the Southern Seas) would have to be phased out as well. It was widely agreed that there needed to be a more diplomatic atmosphere within the IWC. One complexity of whaling politics is that - although it is governments who make decisions - they need to take into account the feelings of public opinion, which are heavily politically and emotionally charged on both sides. For every important step, pro-conservation countries consult with their pro-conservation NGOs. So do the whaling countries with the representatives of their pro-whaling interests. There were also propositions that attempts be made to settle the problems by a "higher" authority such as an independent world commission, a ministerial summit held on the 60th anniversary of the IWC, or a mutually agreed binding mediation or arbitration procedure. Others thought an international diplomatic conference under the auspices of the UN should be convened, or an independent group of eminent persons be assembled to make recommendations. Another idea was that the whaling issue should be integrated into broader oceans, biodiversity and species protection programmes. There has to be a better way forward There were thoughts that research be conducted into the economics of whaling; whale watching means that whales are worth more alive than dead. The question of subsidies for whaling should also be explored. One strong suggestion was that new approaches to conflict management within the IWC should be explored. This case was presented in a most compelling fashion. Only time will tell whether solutions will emerge to what has become an increasingly pressing diplomatic problem. The future of the IWC will be debated as a separate agenda item for the first time this year at the annual meeting in Anchorage, Alaska. It will be a good opportunity to test the ideas that arose in this meeting. I am eager to hear the response from all countries. It is devoutly to be hoped that light rather than heat emerges from that discussion. So many members of the IWC are unhappy with the current situation that there has to be a better way forward.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6703655.stm Ireland | Irish eagle chick is first in century 30 May 2007, 10:28 GMT 11:28 eagle chick is first in century The golden eagle chick is five weeks old A wild golden eagle has been hatched in Ireland for the first time in nearly a century. Two chicks were hatched in a remote area of the Glenveagh National Park in County Donegal but one of the young birds died after five days. There will be a further nervous wait to see if the remaining chick can continue to grow and fledge in late July. Golden eagles last bred in Glenveagh back in 1910. The bird had become extinct in Ireland but was reintroduced at Glenveagh six years ago in an effort to reintroduce the bird to Ireland. The new chick, whose father is from Skye and mother from Sutherland, is now just five weeks old. Project manager for the Golden Eagle Trust Lorcan O'Toole said he was delighted at the news. "We think it is a girl but we are not quite sure. It is still relatively small," he explained. "Eagle chicks are quite vulnerable but she will quickly grow." The trust has been monitoring the birds in Donegal for the last five or six years. Eggs are normally laid around mid March and take six weeks to hatch. This first wild golden eagle is described by conservationists as a milestone in efforts to reverse the decline of native animal and plant species in Ireland. "Emotionally we are just delighted to have such a wild creature breeding in Ireland once again," Mr O'Toole said. "Golden eagles would have been quite a common sight, 300 or 400 years ago. But they have had a pretty poor history for the last two to three centuries. "We just feel that it is a good omen and it bodes well for the future where we can all maybe show more awareness of our landscape." The birds were recently reintroduced to Ireland from Scotland with the assistance of various enthusiasts. In Scotland, under wise management, there are still 420 pairs of golden eagles. But the eagles have died out in Wales and the few remaining English eagles can only be found in the Lake District. "Maybe if there is a bit more tolerance of wildlife, we can see some of these species return to their former haunts," Mr O'Toole said.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6699893.stm hunters spy distant haul 29 May 2007, 11:43 GMT 12:43 hunters spy distant haul The ice-giant Gliese 436 is 30 light years from Earth A haul of 28 new planets beyond our solar system has been detected by the world's most prolific planet hunters. The finds were among 37 objects seen orbiting distant stars by a US and Anglo-Australian team in the last year. Other objects reported by the group, at an American Astronomical Society meeting in Honolulu, included five failed stars, known as brown dwarfs. The finds increase the total number of known exoplanets to 236, more than half of which were discovered by the team. "The more we look, the more we find planets," said Professor Tinney of the University of New South Wales, head of the Australian part of the Anglo-Australian Planet Search. Among the finds were at least four multiple-planetary systems. All of the planets were so-called gas giants, similar to Jupiter, with no solid surface. "Something like 10 to 15% of stars host gas giants," said Professor Tinney. "A larger fraction of stars may host planets too small for us to detect." These could include Earth-sized objects, which could harbour life. The smallest exoplanet discovered orbits Gliese 581 Earlier this year, scientists using the European Southern Observatory (ESO) 3.6m Telescope in Chile discovered the smallest exoplanet - as astronomers call planets that orbit a star other than the Sun - yet. The "super-Earth" orbited the faint star Gliese 581, 20.5 light-years away in the constellation Libra. Its radius was just 1.5 times that of the Earth. Intriguingly, the planet could have liquid water on its surface, a key ingredient of life. It was discovered using a sensitive instrument that can measure tiny changes in the velocity of a star as it experiences the gravitational tug of a nearby planet. It was the same method used to detect the latest batch of extra solar planets. According to Dr Jason Wright of the University of California, Berkeley, one of the members of the US California and Carnegie Planet Search, the technique has become more sophisticated, improving detection rates dramatically. "We're just now getting to the point where, if we were observing our own Solar System from afar, we would be seeing Jupiter," he said. These techniques allow scientists to detect changes in the motion of stars as small as one metre per second. Astronomers are stuck with such indirect methods of detection because current telescope technology struggles to image very distant and faint objects - especially when they orbit close to the glare of a star. The discovery of the 28 new planets has given astronomers new targets to analyse in more detail. For example, a planet discovered two years ago has already yielded a mass of "extraordinarily rich" information, according to Professor Geoff Marcy of the University of California, Berkeley. Circling the star Gliese 436, 30 light years from Earth, was an ice-giant planet that was calculated by Swiss and Belgian scientists to be at least 22 Earth masses, slightly larger than the mass of Neptune. Their studies had also revealed its density. "It must be 50% rock and about 50% water, with perhaps small amounts of hydrogen and helium," said Professor Marcy. "This planet has the interior structure of a hybrid super-Earth/Neptune, with a rocky core surrounded by a significant amount of water compressed into solid form at high pressures and temperatures." However, the planet is not thought to be capable of supporting life. telescope spots new planet 03 May 07 | Science/Nature New 'super-Earth' found in space 25 Apr 07 | Science/Nature Planet shine 'to aid life search' 24 May 06 | Science/Nature Planet hunters find 'super-Earth' 14 Mar 06 | Science/Nature Small planets seen by astronomers 31 Aug 04 | Science/Nature Smallest Earth-like planet found 25 Jan 06 | Science/Nature California and Carnegie Planet Search
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6704549.stm 30 May 2007, 15:03 GMT 16:03 Leakey says climate change is putting great ape species at risk Great apes are facing an "inevitable crisis" arising from climate change, a leading conservationist has warned. Dr Richard Leakey said that growing pressure to switch from fossil fuels to biofuels could result in further destruction of the animals' habitats. The chair of WildlifeDirect called for immediate action and proposed financial incentives to save forests from destruction as one possible solution. He said: "Climate change will undoubtedly impact everything we know." The implications for biodiversity are there for all to see The great apes - gorillas, chimps, bonobos and orangutans - are already under threat from habitat destruction, poaching, logging and disease. The Great Apes Survival Project (Grasp), a United Nations Environment Programme (Unep) initiative, has warned that great apes are at risk of imminent extinction unless drastic action is taken. In advance of a talk at the UK's Royal Geographical Society, Dr Leakey told journalists that climate threats now had to be added to the mix. The former director of the Kenyan Wildlife Service said: "I am concerned about the pressures on the land as a result of changes to the climate, but also the pressures on the land in terms of people's reaction to climate change and the shift away from fossil fuels to biofuels." The great apes: Status check He said that "great swathes" of forest had already been destroyed in South Asia to make way for palm oil plantations, and this had had a dramatic impact on orangutans, which currently number 50,000. Palm oil is used in vegetable oil, soaps, shampoos, industrial substances, but it has also been proposed as an alternative to fossil fuel. Dr Leakey said the growing pressure to turn to biofuels such as palm oil could place the great apes' habitat in further peril. He added: "People shrug their shoulders and say what are poor countries to do if they cannot exploit their natural resources, and I can understand this, but it is not sustainable the way it is going." There is also evidence that deforestation would further drive climate change itself by raising the amount of greenhouse gas carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, Dr Leakey said. Dr Leakey suggested "biodiversity credits" could be a possible solution. "Being paid for not cutting down indigenous forests and getting credit for that is a further step that builds on the idea of getting paid for planting new forests," he explained. "It does seem that we cannot stop development, but it does also seem that perhaps we can stop development where critical species are threatened, and perhaps there could be a price added to that." Dr Leakey is a prominent conservationist in Kenya He said that there could be creative ways to solve the problems that climate change could bring, but added that it was crucial that action was taken now. Dr Leakey told journalists: "Could the great apes go because of climate change? Yes. Possibly not within our lifetime, but what about in 100 or 200 years? "Climate change is measurable and is happening at rate that is almost unprecedented from what we know in previous history, and the implications for biodiversity are there for all to see." Richard Leakey is a palaeo-anthropologist, responsible for extensive fossil finds related to human evolution, and renowned Kenyan conservationist. His parents, Louis and Mary Leakey, were prominent palaeontologists, finding and excavating key sites around Africa.
