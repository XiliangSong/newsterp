Their intention was to spend a year of their new rural life eating only what they could grow themselves or buy from local suppliers. The plan was no whim. Kingsolver and her husband, Steven L. Hopp, a biologist who teaches environmental studies, had been raising fruit and vegetables at Hopp’s farm every summer since they met. Year of Food Life. By Barbara Kingsolver with Steven L. Hopp and Camille Kingsolver. Drawings by Richard A. Houser. 370 pp. HarperCollins Publishers. $26.95. First Chapter: ‘Animal, Vegetable, Miracle’ Kingsolver, it emerges, is hardly unsuited to her new project, documented in “Animal, Vegetable, Miracle,” an engaging amalgam of memoir, environmental reporting and how-to book. She won the Betty Crocker Homemaker of Tomorrow Award in 1972 and studied biology in college and graduate school. Deeply frugal, she was raised in Kentucky among people who still remembered the hunger of the Depression, and she herself recalls qualifying for food stamps in the odd-jobs days before she hit the best-seller lists. Her activism also started early, when she watched farmers founder as they tried to wean themselves from tobacco. Things are better now. Kentucky farmers sell pasture-raised pork, lamb and turkey, and even “Kentucky caviar” from farmed fish. The farmers’ market supplies salad greens when it’s only starting to get warm. Local farms have meat and eggs year-round. Supermarkets become quick stops for dairy products and locally milled flour. Rules are bent for spices, and each family member gets a wild card at the outset: Kingsolver’s husband logically picks coffee (fair-trade and organic, it goes without saying), though the fresh fruit that her older daughter, Camille, craves is a bit too much (she has to settle for dried). So the hardship of Kingsolver’s planned abstinence isn’t that great. Nevertheless, with the passing months, the rigors of sticking to the seasons sink in. Economic and physical realities sink in too. Kingsolver’s 9-year-old, Lily, goes into the poultry business, calculating how many eggs and chickens she must sell to earn money for a horse. Death as a part of life — and, especially, eating — is unavoidable. Lily won’t name her chickens, so she can face killing and selling them. Her mother, an unapologetic meat-eater, points out that vegetarians kill living plants, not to mention the insects and field animals that inevitably fall to the harvesting process. “You can leave the killing to others and pretend it never happened,” she writes, “or you can look it in the eye and know it.” As for sweat and mud, no one shies from either. Kingsolver finishes one May evening “aching and hungry” and decides that “labors like this help a person appreciate why good food costs what it does. It ought to cost more.” This is a message Americans can’t hear often enough. So are the many others Kingsolver has researched with admirable thoroughness, delivering them with a casual urgency that only occasionally veers into preachiness. (“California vegetables are not the serpent, it’s all of us who open our veins to the flow of gas-fueled foods.”) The book is a useful guide for the apprentice activist, picking up where Kingsolver’s friend and mentor Joan Dye Gussow left off with “This Organic Life.” Kingsolver’s husband contributes sidebars on the hazards and inequities of industrial agriculture, along with advice on how to make yourself heard at the local supermarket and by legislators debating farm bills. Kingsolver remains aware of how challenging most readers will find her program. It comes as a relief, for instance, when she says that stress-reducing Fridays are invariably pizza night — and then it turns out that the pizza is made from scratch. But she generally succeeds at adopting the warm tone of a confiding friend who can win you over with self-deprecating, you-too-can-make-cheese-every-day enthusiasm. And she does want you to think seriously about following her example, even if you’re gardenless. At the end of the year, she finds that she has fed her family for under 50 cents a head per meal. “It doesn’t cost a fortune, in other words. Nor does it require a pickup truck, or a calico bonnet.” Corby Kummer is a senior editor of The Atlantic Monthly.

While she reads the citation in the hall of a natural history museum, beneath a giant fiberglass manta ray, “the jaws of sharks, fixed in the gape of their everlasting grins,” display “their triple rows of teeth.” pp. Harcourt. $24. First Chapter: ‘The Sea Lady’ Ailsa searches the crowd for Humphrey Clark, a marine biologist, but this man, whom “she most keenly sought and avoided and hoped and feared to see,” is absent. Instead he is presented to the reader as he rides a train to the seaside town of Ornemouth to receive an honorary degree from the local university. Given his occupation, his musings naturally assume an ichthyological cast: “One could spend one of many lifetimes studying the optics of fish. Happily studying the optics of fish. Or the limbs of lobsters. Or the spawning of lampreys. Or the sex changes of wrasse. Or the cleaning symbioses of sharks.” Just when it seems time either to towel off and abandon the book or grab an imaginary aqualung and flippers and go with the narrative flow, a third character appears, someone Drabble identifies as the Public Orator, who comments on the action: “Two of the principal characters have been presented, in some detail, and we suspect that they are soon to meet.” Who is this guy? Not, he quickly assures us, the sort of gabby, omniscient narrator you might find in 19th-century novels: “The Orator is not a puppet master, and on principle dislikes artificial arrangements, narrative devices, false dawns and false epiphanies.” Nor is he, as he later admits, a metafictional device designed to display, with a wink and a nod, the artificiality of all he conveys: “The Public Orator is trying to work out yet another story, and is both frustrated and encouraged by the lack of an ending, and by what appears (can it be?) to be the free will of the protagonists.” “The Sea Lady” is a waterlogged, ramshackle contraption that fascinates even as it annoys. Drabble’s longtime readers won’t be surprised by the novel’s tactics. After all, the most important entry in her long bibliography may be her sympathetic biography of Arnold Bennett, one of the Edwardian novelists — along with John Galsworthy and H. G. Wells — denounced by Virginia Woolf. (“They have given us a house,” Woolf declared, arguing that their concentration on external description, on the workings of society, failed to convey the inner lives of their characters, “in the hope that we may be able to deduce the human beings who live there.”) It took nerve for Drabble, then chiefly known as books about frustrated young women, to quarrel with modernism’s most exalted heroine, and she extended her challenge by hauling a lot of Edwardian luggage into novels like “The Realms of Gold,” “The Ice Age,” “The Middle Ground” and “The Radiant Way.” These books confronted Drabble’s favored cast of characters — hyper-educated, chattering solipsists — with the blunt economic and class realities of the Thatcher years. In “The Sea Lady,” Drabble has stuck to this regimen. Ailsa Kelman and Humphrey Clark share a long history, known only to themselves and each other. And fate, or possibly that unexplained Public Orator, has arranged for them to meet again as recipients of honorary degrees at Ornemouth, the place where their relationship began, more than half a century earlier. Humphrey spent his early childhood in the village of Finsterness, on the edge of Ornemouth, living with his mother and aunt while his father served in the British Navy during World War II. His memories of these days, roaming the edge of the beach with his friend, Sandy Clegg, are memorably, elegiacally recorded: “Nobody bothered to nag them not to go near the edge and not to swim out of their depth. They swam, and scrambled together along the cliffs, and waded in the river, and fished, and dug holes in the mud, and stared at the degenerate sea squirts, and collected buckets full of mermaid’s purses, and captured razorfish and cockles.” Paul Gray is a regular contributor to the Book Review.

All bets were off. New Yorkers who always know where they’re going didn’t know where to go. Cab drivers named Muhammad were now feared as the enemy within; strangers on the street were improbably embraced like family under a canopy of fliers for the missing. Such, for a while anyway, was the “new normal,” though the old normal began to reassert itself almost as soon as that facile catchphrase was coined. Today 9/11 carries so many burdens — of interpretation, of sentimentality, of politics, of war — that sometimes it’s hard to find the rubble of the actual event beneath the layers of edifice we’ve built on top of it. (Or built on top of all of it except ground zero.) pp. Scribner. $26. First Chapter: ‘Falling Man’ Suzanne DeChillo/The his new novel, Don DeLillo shoves us back into the day itself in his first sentence: “It was not a street anymore but a world, a time and space of falling ash and near night.” He resurrects that world as it was, bottling the mortal dread, high anxiety and mass confusion that seem so distant now. Though the sensibility and prose are echt DeLillo, “Falling Man” is not necessarily the 9/11 novel you’d expect from novels that probe the atomic age (“Underworld”) and the Kennedy assassination (“Libra”) on the broadest imaginable canvas, intermingling historical characters with fictional creations. With the exception of , who slips into the crevices of “Falling Man” as an almost spectral presence, DeLillo mentions none of the other boldface names of 9/11, not even the mayor. Instead of unfurling an epic, DeLillo usually keeps the focus on an extended family of middle-class Manhattanites. If “Underworld” took its cues from the kinetic cinema of Eisenstein, “Falling Man,” up until its remarkable final sequence, is all oblique silences and enigmatic close-ups reminiscent of the domestic anomie of the New Wave. In DeLillo’s hands, this is not at all limiting or prosaic. There’s a method to the Resnais-like fogginess. The cumulative effect is devastating, as DeLillo in exquisite increments lowers the reader into an inexorable rendezvous with raw terror. Humor is not this novel’s calling card, but there is one tongue-in-cheek passage mocking an unwieldy nonfiction 9/11 manuscript that, we’re told, is a legend in publishing circles: “a rushed project, timely, newsworthy, even visionary, at least in the publisher’s planned catalog copy — a book detailing a series of interlocking global forces that appeared to converge at an explosive point in time and space that might be said to represent the locus of Boston, New York and Washington on a late-summer morning early in the 21st century.” DeLillo can laugh because he has been there and done that long ago, back when such projects really were visionary as well as prescient. The newly constructed twin towers, for instance, make an appearance in one of his early novels, “Players” (1977), when one of its characters goes to work for a counseling organization called the Grief Management Council: “It was her original view that the World Trade Center was an unlikely headquarters for an outfit such as this. But she changed her mind as time passed. Where else would you stack all this grief?” A decade later came DeLillo’s premonition of national apocalypse, the “airborne toxic event” of “White Noise,” and, in 1991, “Mao II,” which opens with the Rev. Sun Myung Moon’s mass wedding of 6,500 couples at Yankee Stadium and ends in the hell of Beirut. Moon, Mao, the Ayatollah Khomeini: today “Mao II” seems one of the most forceful harbingers, among the countless that were ignored, of the steady march of international terror toward the locus of Boston, New York and Washington. Bill Gray, the reclusive, Pynchonesque writer at the center of “Mao II,” laments that terrorists, the bomb makers and gunmen, have annexed the territory that once belonged to the novelist: the ability to “alter the inner life of the culture.” As he sees it, the “news of disaster is the only narrative people need,” and “the darker the news, the grander the narrative.” After 9/11, DeLillo picked up his fictional alter ego’s point in an essay for Harper’s, “In the Ruins of the Future,” that grappled with how a novelist might respond to terror now that it had hit home. “The narrative ends in the rubble and it is left to us to create the counternarrative,” DeLillo wrote. “People running for their lives are part of the story that is left to us” because “they take us beyond the hard numbers of dead and missing and give us a glimpse of elevated being.” An event like 9/11 cannot be bent to “the mercies of analogy or simile.” Primal terror — “the cellphones, the lost shoes, the handkerchiefs mashed in the faces of running men and women” — has to take precedence over politics, history and religion. “There is something empty in the sky,” he wrote. “The writer tries to give memory, tenderness and meaning to all that howling space.” Frank Rich, an Op-Ed columnist for The Times, is the author, most recently, of “The Greatest Story Ever Sold: The Decline and Fall of Truth From 9/11 to Katrina.” early access to articles from this Sunday's Times.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/review/Pinker-t.html The Canon: - Natalie Angier baby sucks on a pencil and her panicky mother fears the child will get lead poisoning. A politician argues that hydrogen can replace fossil fuels as our nation’s energy source. A consumer tells a reporter that she refuses to eat tomatoes that have genes in them. And a newsmagazine condemns the prospects of cloning because it could mass-produce an army of zombies. 293 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $27. First Chapter: ‘The Canon’ These are just a few examples of scientific illiteracy — inane misconceptions that could have been avoided with a smidgen of freshman science. (For those afraid to ask: pencil “lead” is carbon; hydrogen fuel takes more energy to produce than it releases; all living things contain genes; a clone is just a twin.) Though we live in an era of stunning scientific understanding, all too often the average educated person will have none of it. People who would sneer at the vulgarian who has never read Virginia Woolf will insouciantly boast of their ignorance of basic physics. Most of our intellectual magazines discuss science only when it bears on their political concerns or when they can portray science as just another political arena. As the nation’s math departments and biotech labs fill up with foreign students, the brightest young Americans learn better ways to sue one another or to capitalize on currency fluctuations. And all this is on top of our nation’s endless supply of New Age nostrums, psychic hot lines, creationist textbook stickers and other flimflam. The costs of an ignorance of science are not just practical ones like misbegotten policies, forgone cures and a unilateral disarmament in national competitiveness. There is a moral cost as well. It is an astonishing fact about our species that we understand so much about the history of the universe, the forces that make it tick, the stuff it’s made of, the origin of living things and the machinery of life. A failure to nurture this knowledge shows a philistine indifference to the magnificent achievements humanity is capable of, like allowing a great work of art to molder in a warehouse. In “The Canon: Natalie Angier aims to do her part for scientific literacy. Though Angier is a regular contributor to the Science Times section of this newspaper, “The Canon” departs from the usual treatment of science by journalists, who typically cover the “news,” the finding that upsets the apple cart, rather than the consensus. Though one can understand why journalists tend to report the latest word from the front — editors’ demand for news rather than pedagogy, and the desire to show that science is a fractious human activity rather than priestly revelation — this approach doesn’t always serve a widespread understanding of science. The results of isolated experiments are more ephemeral than conclusions from literature reviews (which usually don’t fit into a press release), and the discovery-du-jour approach can whipsaw readers between contradictory claims and leave them thinking, “Whatever.” Angier’s goals are summed up in two words in her subtitle: beautiful basics. “The Canon” presents the fundamentals of science: numbers and probability, matter and energy, the origins and structure of living things, and the natural history of our planet, solar system, galaxy and universe. These are, she judges, the basics that every educated person should master, and a prerequisite to a genuine understanding of the material in any newspaper’s science coverage. And she presents these basics as beautiful: worthy of knowing for their own sake, even if they won’t help us save the planet, age successfully or compete with the Chinese. “The Canon” begins on an engaging note, lamenting what is one of my pet peeves as well — the idea that science is something for kids. When their children turn 13, Angier notes, many parents abandon their memberships in zoos and science museums for more “mature” institutions like theaters and art museums. And who can blame them, when visiting a modern science museum, in her priceless description, consists of a “mad pinball pinging from one hands-on science exhibit to the next, pounding on knobs to make artificial earthquakes, or cranking gears to see Newton’s laws in motion, or something like that; who bothers to read the explanatory placards anyway? And, oops, hmm, hey, Mom, this thing seems to have stopped working!” Many new science museums seem to be built on the dubious theory that a person’s life interests are formed in childhood — that “just as the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined.” Instead they may be conveying the message “When I was a child ... I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.” Steven Pinker is Johnstone professor of psychology at Harvard University. His seventh book, “The Stuff of Thought: Language as a Window Into Human Nature,” will be published in September.

At the time, there was a great deal of debate about the nature and meaning of his death: was it an accident or a suicide, illness or cosmic despair? But it is surely the way he lived and wrote in the four decades after the war that matter most. If the ancient Greeks were right that it is the manner of one’s death as much as the substance of one’s life that determines its ultimate meaning, then much of European Jewry, not to mention European culture, would need to be written off as an abject failure. Primo Levi. Translated by Ann Goldstein and Alessandra Bastagli. 164 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $21.95. Levi is justly revered for his masterly memoirs, beginning with “Survival in Auschwitz” and continuing through “The Reawakening,” “The Periodic Table” and finally, and most darkly, “The Drowned and the Saved.” “Survival in Auschwitz” was written in a white heat soon after Levi’s liberation and published in 1947, though translation and recognition came much more slowly. It has often been noted, but is worth noting again, that the American title represents an unfortunate decision by the publisher to replace the haunting Italian title, “Se Questo È un Uomo” — “If This Is a Man” — with a more utilitarian one. The decision signals a confusion that exists in Levi’s reputation and that perhaps existed even inside of him: the urge to poeticize and philosophize competing with the need to bear witness, to record in as literal and straightforward a manner as possible the Nazi war against Western civilization in general and Jews in particular. But in all his writing, Levi, who worked as an industrial chemist much of his life, combined scientific detachment with deep, sympathetic imagination, a combination that allowed him to parse with excruciating clarity all the degradations — large and small, physical, psychic and spiritual — of the Nazi genocide. In keeping with the complexity and confusions of being a philosopher-witness, Levi was also a poet and a fiction writer. Though he wrote an honorable novel about a band of Jewish partisans, “If Not Now, When?” (Levi himself was a partisan before his arrest and shipment to Auschwitz), he was more successful with short stories. He was a master of a peculiar hybrid form, a sort of science fiction that seems half Ray Bradbury and half Kafka, with an added undertow that threatens to carry the reader into an abyss of dark knowledge even though the Holocaust is almost never overtly mentioned. There are many fine examples of Levi’s strange fictional style in “A Tranquil Star,” a collection of 17 previously untranslated stories rendered into lucid, seamless English by Ann Goldstein and Alessandra Bastagli. The book is divided into two sections corresponding roughly to two phases of Levi’s career. In the first, he was a full-time chemist and paint-factory manager who wrote in the margins of that life; in the second he was a full-time writer, having achieved enough renown and security to leave his job in the mid-1970s. But all of these stories live under and inside the shadow of the Holocaust, and it would be futile, and perhaps a betrayal, to divest them of their context by reading them any other way. Even a story like “Bear Meat” (1961), which recalls a free-spirited prewar trip into the mountains that Levi took with two friends, has its post-Holocaust reverberations. Unequipped for their alpine journey, the boys in the story are soon forced to “eat bear meat,” slang for tasting extreme discomfort. They are lost and exhausted, and barely survive freezing in the night, but the narrator looks back on the experience with dreamy longing. Respect, love, success — “none of these things,” he says, “has the taste of bear meat: the taste of being strong and free, which means free to make mistakes; the taste of feeling young in the mountains, of being your own master, which means master of the world.” By focusing on nostalgia not for prewar pleasure but for prewar pain, Levi shrewdly evokes a time when hardship too had an innocence, when it tempered the human spirit rather than extinguishing it.

That roster of chefs is probably unknown to you, but as White himself explains, they were the top of the heap in 1980s London, the kings of British fine dining, with difficult temperaments to match. The point being made is that the young White was a hard bloke, notoriously impervious to “bollocking,” his favored term for the ritual abuse heaped upon kitchen inferiors by the man in charge. In time, White got to run his own kitchen, at a place called Harveys, and then several more kitchens after that, ascending in the late ’80s and ’90s to greater culinary and P.R. heights than any of his mentors. He also out-bollocked them all, acquiring a reputation as “the most foul-tempered, most mercurial and most bullying” of British chefs, as Bill Buford described him in last year’s “Heat.” (That book’s main character, Mario Batali, spent a tumultuous few months cooking under White’s thumb at a London pub called the Six Bells in 1983, when both men were callow and unfamous.) White is a relative unknown in America, while a former protégé from whom he is estranged, Gordon Ramsay, has turned into a trans-Atlantic restaurateur and reality-TV star (with, among other shows, “Hell’s Kitchen” on Fox and “The F-Word” on Britain’s Channel 4). Factor in Anthony Bourdain’s aggressively marketed naughty-boy persona and the vogue for elbows-out kitchen machismo on programs like “Iron Chef” and “Top Chef,” and you get the sense that White, whose reign predated all this stuff, is trying to stake his claim as the original gangsta. Certainly the packaging of — whose British version carries the even more incendiary title “White Slave” — suggests this. The jacket copy labels White “the godfather of rock-star chefs,” and the cover displays a sexy, menacing portrait, by the art photographer Bob Carlos Clarke, of White in his prime: his hair Euro-wavy like a Fiat heir’s, his face elegantly gaunt, his muscular right forearm tensed as he ominously clutches a cleaver. So it’s a relief to find that once you get past all the histrionic buildup, is a moving, unaffected, delightfully honest book. At times it’s almost sweet. The culinary memoir it most recalls is, of all things, Jacques Pépin’s “Apprentice.” Like Pépin, White grew up in a family that had little but an appreciation of good food. And like “The Apprentice,” White’s book has early moments of heartbreaking privation and loss that give way to a happy momentum — a dawning on the protagonist’s part and, eventually, on that of his bosses, peers and the public, that he is preternaturally gifted at cooking. White, despite his looks and name, is as British as beans on toast. He was born in Leeds, the industrial seat of West Yorkshire, in 1961. His father, Frank, was a local who worked as a deputy chef in various restaurants in the area. His mother, Maria Rosa, was an Italian beauty from Genoa who’d fallen for Frank during a visit to Leeds. Marco, to his chagrin, was the only one of the four White boys to be given an Italian name; his brothers were named Graham, Clive and Craig. His middle name, Pierre, a whimsical suggestion on the part of a Genoese aunt, was an even greater source of embarrassment, kept secret until White revealed it to the restaurant critic for The Sunday Times of London in a 1987 telephone conversation. The critic, Egon Ronay, shortly thereafter gave Harveys a rave review and identified the chef as Marco Pierre White — simultaneously putting the restaurant on the map and rebranding the rough-around-the-edges chef as a posh-sounding Pan-European triple-namer. But before all that could happen, there was the requisite slog of apprenticeships and subordinate positions in kitchens far and wide, starting at the Hotel St. George in Harrogate, a spa town near Leeds. White was all of 16 when he bailed on school and got lost in work, “already hooked on the security of the kitchen.” A dyslexic before dyslexia was widely understood, he found solace in the physicality and sensuality of food prep — he was in his element, whereas at school, he writes, “for a very long time I assumed I was an idiot.” David Kamp, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, is United States of Arugula.” in Britain Wins Libel Judgment Against The Times Gustibus: Don&#8217;t Point That Menu at My Child, Please Basic Training: Modern Marathoners Have Fewer Miles on Them Design That Solves Problems for the World&#8217;s Poor Big Disparities in Judging of Asylum Cases Fighting the Tide, a Few Restaurants Tilt to Tap Water Op-Ed Contributor: Physician, Upgrade Thyself Op-Ed Contributor: Fliers and No Plan B Economix: Go, Eat, You Never Know Fault Harsh Methods in Interrogation Push for Big Subsidies for Coal Process Google Deal Said to Bring U.S. Scrutiny Iraqi Refugees, in Dire Straits, Turn to the Sex Trade in Syria Giuliani Tempers Tough Image on Campaign Justices' Ruling Limits Suits on Pay Disparity Hitherto Staunch G.O.P.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/review/Kummer-t.html Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life - Barbara Kingsolver Year of Vegetables few years ago, the novelist Barbara Kingsolver packed her husband and two daughters into a car and left their home in Tucson for good, resettling on a farm in southern Appalachia. Their intention was to spend a year of their new rural life eating only what they could grow themselves or buy from local suppliers. The plan was no whim. Kingsolver and her husband, Steven L. Hopp, a biologist who teaches environmental studies, had been raising fruit and vegetables at Hopp’s farm every summer since they met. Year of Food Life. By Barbara Kingsolver with Steven L. Hopp and Camille Kingsolver. Drawings by Richard A. Houser. 370 pp. HarperCollins Publishers. $26.95. First Chapter: ‘Animal, Vegetable, Miracle’ Kingsolver, it emerges, is hardly unsuited to her new project, documented in “Animal, Vegetable, Miracle,” an engaging amalgam of memoir, environmental reporting and how-to book. She won the Betty Crocker Homemaker of Tomorrow Award in 1972 and studied biology in college and graduate school. Deeply frugal, she was raised in Kentucky among people who still remembered the hunger of the Depression, and she herself recalls qualifying for food stamps in the odd-jobs days before she hit the best-seller lists. Her activism also started early, when she watched farmers founder as they tried to wean themselves from tobacco. Things are better now. Kentucky farmers sell pasture-raised pork, lamb and turkey, and even “Kentucky caviar” from farmed fish. The farmers’ market supplies salad greens when it’s only starting to get warm. Local farms have meat and eggs year-round. Supermarkets become quick stops for dairy products and locally milled flour. Rules are bent for spices, and each family member gets a wild card at the outset: Kingsolver’s husband logically picks coffee (fair-trade and organic, it goes without saying), though the fresh fruit that her older daughter, Camille, craves is a bit too much (she has to settle for dried). So the hardship of Kingsolver’s planned abstinence isn’t that great. Nevertheless, with the passing months, the rigors of sticking to the seasons sink in. Economic and physical realities sink in too. Kingsolver’s 9-year-old, Lily, goes into the poultry business, calculating how many eggs and chickens she must sell to earn money for a horse. Death as a part of life — and, especially, eating — is unavoidable. Lily won’t name her chickens, so she can face killing and selling them. Her mother, an unapologetic meat-eater, points out that vegetarians kill living plants, not to mention the insects and field animals that inevitably fall to the harvesting process. “You can leave the killing to others and pretend it never happened,” she writes, “or you can look it in the eye and know it.” As for sweat and mud, no one shies from either. Kingsolver finishes one May evening “aching and hungry” and decides that “labors like this help a person appreciate why good food costs what it does. It ought to cost more.” This is a message Americans can’t hear often enough. So are the many others Kingsolver has researched with admirable thoroughness, delivering them with a casual urgency that only occasionally veers into preachiness. (“California vegetables are not the serpent, it’s all of us who open our veins to the flow of gas-fueled foods.”) The book is a useful guide for the apprentice activist, picking up where Kingsolver’s friend and mentor Joan Dye Gussow left off with “This Organic Life.” Kingsolver’s husband contributes sidebars on the hazards and inequities of industrial agriculture, along with advice on how to make yourself heard at the local supermarket and by legislators debating farm bills. Kingsolver remains aware of how challenging most readers will find her program. It comes as a relief, for instance, when she says that stress-reducing Fridays are invariably pizza night — and then it turns out that the pizza is made from scratch. But she generally succeeds at adopting the warm tone of a confiding friend who can win you over with self-deprecating, you-too-can-make-cheese-every-day enthusiasm. And she does want you to think seriously about following her example, even if you’re gardenless. At the end of the year, she finds that she has fed her family for under 50 cents a head per meal. “It doesn’t cost a fortune, in other words. Nor does it require a pickup truck, or a calico bonnet.” Corby Kummer is a senior editor of The Atlantic Monthly.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/review/Gray-t.html The Sea Lady: A Late Romance - Margaret Drabble See You Again Kelman, the heroine of Margaret Drabble’s 17th novel, first appears in a dress in which she “gleamed and rippled with smooth muscle, like a fish.” This costume choice is “a happy accident” because Ailsa has been asked to announce, in front of a large London gathering and an even larger television audience, the winner of the Plunkett Prize “for a general science book with a vaguely defined ecological or environmental message” — which turns out to be “Hermaphrodite: Sea Change and Sex Change,” a study of gender-bending in diverse marine species. While she reads the citation in the hall of a natural history museum, beneath a giant fiberglass manta ray, “the jaws of sharks, fixed in the gape of their everlasting grins,” display “their triple rows of teeth.” pp. Harcourt. $24. First Chapter: ‘The Sea Lady’ Ailsa searches the crowd for Humphrey Clark, a marine biologist, but this man, whom “she most keenly sought and avoided and hoped and feared to see,” is absent. Instead he is presented to the reader as he rides a train to the seaside town of Ornemouth to receive an honorary degree from the local university. Given his occupation, his musings naturally assume an ichthyological cast: “One could spend one of many lifetimes studying the optics of fish. Happily studying the optics of fish. Or the limbs of lobsters. Or the spawning of lampreys. Or the sex changes of wrasse. Or the cleaning symbioses of sharks.” Just when it seems time either to towel off and abandon the book or grab an imaginary aqualung and flippers and go with the narrative flow, a third character appears, someone Drabble identifies as the Public Orator, who comments on the action: “Two of the principal characters have been presented, in some detail, and we suspect that they are soon to meet.” Who is this guy? Not, he quickly assures us, the sort of gabby, omniscient narrator you might find in 19th-century novels: “The Orator is not a puppet master, and on principle dislikes artificial arrangements, narrative devices, false dawns and false epiphanies.” Nor is he, as he later admits, a metafictional device designed to display, with a wink and a nod, the artificiality of all he conveys: “The Public Orator is trying to work out yet another story, and is both frustrated and encouraged by the lack of an ending, and by what appears (can it be?) to be the free will of the protagonists.” “The Sea Lady” is a waterlogged, ramshackle contraption that fascinates even as it annoys. Drabble’s longtime readers won’t be surprised by the novel’s tactics. After all, the most important entry in her long bibliography may be her sympathetic biography of Arnold Bennett, one of the Edwardian novelists — along with John Galsworthy and H. G. Wells — denounced by Virginia Woolf. (“They have given us a house,” Woolf declared, arguing that their concentration on external description, on the workings of society, failed to convey the inner lives of their characters, “in the hope that we may be able to deduce the human beings who live there.”) It took nerve for Drabble, then chiefly known as books about frustrated young women, to quarrel with modernism’s most exalted heroine, and she extended her challenge by hauling a lot of Edwardian luggage into novels like “The Realms of Gold,” “The Ice Age,” “The Middle Ground” and “The Radiant Way.” These books confronted Drabble’s favored cast of characters — hyper-educated, chattering solipsists — with the blunt economic and class realities of the Thatcher years. In “The Sea Lady,” Drabble has stuck to this regimen. Ailsa Kelman and Humphrey Clark share a long history, known only to themselves and each other. And fate, or possibly that unexplained Public Orator, has arranged for them to meet again as recipients of honorary degrees at Ornemouth, the place where their relationship began, more than half a century earlier. Humphrey spent his early childhood in the village of Finsterness, on the edge of Ornemouth, living with his mother and aunt while his father served in the British Navy during World War II. His memories of these days, roaming the edge of the beach with his friend, Sandy Clegg, are memorably, elegiacally recorded: “Nobody bothered to nag them not to go near the edge and not to swim out of their depth. They swam, and scrambled together along the cliffs, and waded in the river, and fished, and dug holes in the mud, and stared at the degenerate sea squirts, and collected buckets full of mermaid’s purses, and captured razorfish and cockles.” Paul Gray is a regular contributor to the Book Review.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/review/Rosen-t.html A Tranquil Star: Unpublished Stories - Primo Levi years ago last month, Primo Levi plunged headlong into the stairwell of the apartment building in Turin where he had been born and to which he had returned after liberation from Auschwitz. At the time, there was a great deal of debate about the nature and meaning of his death: was it an accident or a suicide, illness or cosmic despair? But it is surely the way he lived and wrote in the four decades after the war that matter most. If the ancient Greeks were right that it is the manner of one’s death as much as the substance of one’s life that determines its ultimate meaning, then much of European Jewry, not to mention European culture, would need to be written off as an abject failure. Primo Levi. Translated by Ann Goldstein and Alessandra Bastagli. 164 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $21.95. Levi is justly revered for his masterly memoirs, beginning with “Survival in Auschwitz” and continuing through “The Reawakening,” “The Periodic Table” and finally, and most darkly, “The Drowned and the Saved.” “Survival in Auschwitz” was written in a white heat soon after Levi’s liberation and published in 1947, though translation and recognition came much more slowly. It has often been noted, but is worth noting again, that the American title represents an unfortunate decision by the publisher to replace the haunting Italian title, “Se Questo È un Uomo” — “If This Is a Man” — with a more utilitarian one. The decision signals a confusion that exists in Levi’s reputation and that perhaps existed even inside of him: the urge to poeticize and philosophize competing with the need to bear witness, to record in as literal and straightforward a manner as possible the Nazi war against Western civilization in general and Jews in particular. But in all his writing, Levi, who worked as an industrial chemist much of his life, combined scientific detachment with deep, sympathetic imagination, a combination that allowed him to parse with excruciating clarity all the degradations — large and small, physical, psychic and spiritual — of the Nazi genocide. In keeping with the complexity and confusions of being a philosopher-witness, Levi was also a poet and a fiction writer. Though he wrote an honorable novel about a band of Jewish partisans, “If Not Now, When?” (Levi himself was a partisan before his arrest and shipment to Auschwitz), he was more successful with short stories. He was a master of a peculiar hybrid form, a sort of science fiction that seems half Ray Bradbury and half Kafka, with an added undertow that threatens to carry the reader into an abyss of dark knowledge even though the Holocaust is almost never overtly mentioned. There are many fine examples of Levi’s strange fictional style in “A Tranquil Star,” a collection of 17 previously untranslated stories rendered into lucid, seamless English by Ann Goldstein and Alessandra Bastagli. The book is divided into two sections corresponding roughly to two phases of Levi’s career. In the first, he was a full-time chemist and paint-factory manager who wrote in the margins of that life; in the second he was a full-time writer, having achieved enough renown and security to leave his job in the mid-1970s. But all of these stories live under and inside the shadow of the Holocaust, and it would be futile, and perhaps a betrayal, to divest them of their context by reading them any other way. Even a story like “Bear Meat” (1961), which recalls a free-spirited prewar trip into the mountains that Levi took with two friends, has its post-Holocaust reverberations. Unequipped for their alpine journey, the boys in the story are soon forced to “eat bear meat,” slang for tasting extreme discomfort. They are lost and exhausted, and barely survive freezing in the night, but the narrator looks back on the experience with dreamy longing. Respect, love, success — “none of these things,” he says, “has the taste of bear meat: the taste of being strong and free, which means free to make mistakes; the taste of feeling young in the mountains, of being your own master, which means master of the world.” By focusing on nostalgia not for prewar pleasure but for prewar pain, Levi shrewdly evokes a time when hardship too had an innocence, when it tempered the human spirit rather than extinguishing it.

A politician argues that hydrogen can replace fossil fuels as our nation’s energy source. A consumer tells a reporter that she refuses to eat tomatoes that have genes in them. And a newsmagazine condemns the prospects of cloning because it could mass-produce an army of zombies. 293 pp. Houghton Mifflin Company. $27. First Chapter: ‘The Canon’ These are just a few examples of scientific illiteracy — inane misconceptions that could have been avoided with a smidgen of freshman science. (For those afraid to ask: pencil “lead” is carbon; hydrogen fuel takes more energy to produce than it releases; all living things contain genes; a clone is just a twin.) Though we live in an era of stunning scientific understanding, all too often the average educated person will have none of it. People who would sneer at the vulgarian who has never read Virginia Woolf will insouciantly boast of their ignorance of basic physics. Most of our intellectual magazines discuss science only when it bears on their political concerns or when they can portray science as just another political arena. As the nation’s math departments and biotech labs fill up with foreign students, the brightest young Americans learn better ways to sue one another or to capitalize on currency fluctuations. And all this is on top of our nation’s endless supply of New Age nostrums, psychic hot lines, creationist textbook stickers and other flimflam. The costs of an ignorance of science are not just practical ones like misbegotten policies, forgone cures and a unilateral disarmament in national competitiveness. There is a moral cost as well. It is an astonishing fact about our species that we understand so much about the history of the universe, the forces that make it tick, the stuff it’s made of, the origin of living things and the machinery of life. A failure to nurture this knowledge shows a philistine indifference to the magnificent achievements humanity is capable of, like allowing a great work of art to molder in a warehouse. In “The Canon: Natalie Angier aims to do her part for scientific literacy. Though Angier is a regular contributor to the Science Times section of this newspaper, “The Canon” departs from the usual treatment of science by journalists, who typically cover the “news,” the finding that upsets the apple cart, rather than the consensus. Though one can understand why journalists tend to report the latest word from the front — editors’ demand for news rather than pedagogy, and the desire to show that science is a fractious human activity rather than priestly revelation — this approach doesn’t always serve a widespread understanding of science. The results of isolated experiments are more ephemeral than conclusions from literature reviews (which usually don’t fit into a press release), and the discovery-du-jour approach can whipsaw readers between contradictory claims and leave them thinking, “Whatever.” Angier’s goals are summed up in two words in her subtitle: beautiful basics. “The Canon” presents the fundamentals of science: numbers and probability, matter and energy, the origins and structure of living things, and the natural history of our planet, solar system, galaxy and universe. These are, she judges, the basics that every educated person should master, and a prerequisite to a genuine understanding of the material in any newspaper’s science coverage. And she presents these basics as beautiful: worthy of knowing for their own sake, even if they won’t help us save the planet, age successfully or compete with the Chinese. “The Canon” begins on an engaging note, lamenting what is one of my pet peeves as well — the idea that science is something for kids. When their children turn 13, Angier notes, many parents abandon their memberships in zoos and science museums for more “mature” institutions like theaters and art museums. And who can blame them, when visiting a modern science museum, in her priceless description, consists of a “mad pinball pinging from one hands-on science exhibit to the next, pounding on knobs to make artificial earthquakes, or cranking gears to see Newton’s laws in motion, or something like that; who bothers to read the explanatory placards anyway? And, oops, hmm, hey, Mom, this thing seems to have stopped working!” Many new science museums seem to be built on the dubious theory that a person’s life interests are formed in childhood — that “just as the twig is bent, the tree’s inclined.” Instead they may be conveying the message “When I was a child ...

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/27/books/review/Kamp-t.html The - Marco Pierre White have a new boy starting next month,” announces Raymond Blanc, the esteemed chef-owner of a British countryside restaurant called Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, about a third of the way into Marco Pierre White’s memoir. “His name is Marco White and he has worked for Albert Roux, Pierre Koffman and Nico Ladenis. None of them could break him.” DEVIL IN THE KITCHEN Sex, Pain, Madness, and the Making of a Great Chef. By Marco Pierre White with James Steen. Illustrated. 244 pp. Bloomsbury. $24.95. That roster of chefs is probably unknown to you, but as White himself explains, they were the top of the heap in 1980s London, the kings of British fine dining, with difficult temperaments to match. The point being made is that the young White was a hard bloke, notoriously impervious to “bollocking,” his favored term for the ritual abuse heaped upon kitchen inferiors by the man in charge. In time, White got to run his own kitchen, at a place called Harveys, and then several more kitchens after that, ascending in the late ’80s and ’90s to greater culinary and P.R. heights than any of his mentors. He also out-bollocked them all, acquiring a reputation as “the most foul-tempered, most mercurial and most bullying” of British chefs, as Bill Buford described him in last year’s “Heat.” (That book’s main character, Mario Batali, spent a tumultuous few months cooking under White’s thumb at a London pub called the Six Bells in 1983, when both men were callow and unfamous.) White is a relative unknown in America, while a former protégé from whom he is estranged, Gordon Ramsay, has turned into a trans-Atlantic restaurateur and reality-TV star (with, among other shows, “Hell’s Kitchen” on Fox and “The F-Word” on Britain’s Channel 4). Factor in Anthony Bourdain’s aggressively marketed naughty-boy persona and the vogue for elbows-out kitchen machismo on programs like “Iron Chef” and “Top Chef,” and you get the sense that White, whose reign predated all this stuff, is trying to stake his claim as the original gangsta. Certainly the packaging of — whose British version carries the even more incendiary title “White Slave” — suggests this. The jacket copy labels White “the godfather of rock-star chefs,” and the cover displays a sexy, menacing portrait, by the art photographer Bob Carlos Clarke, of White in his prime: his hair Euro-wavy like a Fiat heir’s, his face elegantly gaunt, his muscular right forearm tensed as he ominously clutches a cleaver. So it’s a relief to find that once you get past all the histrionic buildup, is a moving, unaffected, delightfully honest book. At times it’s almost sweet. The culinary memoir it most recalls is, of all things, Jacques Pépin’s “Apprentice.” Like Pépin, White grew up in a family that had little but an appreciation of good food. And like “The Apprentice,” White’s book has early moments of heartbreaking privation and loss that give way to a happy momentum — a dawning on the protagonist’s part and, eventually, on that of his bosses, peers and the public, that he is preternaturally gifted at cooking. White, despite his looks and name, is as British as beans on toast. He was born in Leeds, the industrial seat of West Yorkshire, in 1961. His father, Frank, was a local who worked as a deputy chef in various restaurants in the area. His mother, Maria Rosa, was an Italian beauty from Genoa who’d fallen for Frank during a visit to Leeds. Marco, to his chagrin, was the only one of the four White boys to be given an Italian name; his brothers were named Graham, Clive and Craig. His middle name, Pierre, a whimsical suggestion on the part of a Genoese aunt, was an even greater source of embarrassment, kept secret until White revealed it to the restaurant critic for The Sunday Times of London in a 1987 telephone conversation. The critic, Egon Ronay, shortly thereafter gave Harveys a rave review and identified the chef as Marco Pierre White — simultaneously putting the restaurant on the map and rebranding the rough-around-the-edges chef as a posh-sounding Pan-European triple-namer. But before all that could happen, there was the requisite slog of apprenticeships and subordinate positions in kitchens far and wide, starting at the Hotel St. George in Harrogate, a spa town near Leeds. White was all of 16 when he bailed on school and got lost in work, “already hooked on the security of the kitchen.” A dyslexic before dyslexia was widely understood, he found solace in the physicality and sensuality of food prep — he was in his element, whereas at school, he writes, “for a very long time I assumed I was an idiot.” David Kamp, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, is United States of Arugula.” in Britain Wins Libel Judgment Against The Times Traffic - 1962
