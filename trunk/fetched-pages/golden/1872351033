Prosecutors did not say why they dropped the count, a decision that came with no fanfare while jurors were out of the courtroom and issues were being discussed by the judge and lawyers. &#8220;At this time the prosecution rests,&#8221; an assistant United States attorney, Eric H. Sussman, told Judge Amy J. St. Eve of Federal District Court just before 3 p.m., ending the government&#8217;s case against Mr. Black after more than 10 weeks. Lawyers for Mr. Black and three co-defendants were scheduled to begin calling witnesses Thursday in what is expected to be a much less time-consuming case for the defense. Mr. Black, 62, and three other former executives are charged with swindling , a newspaper holding company, out of millions of dollars through the sale of The government says the scheme began with a decision in the late 1990s by Mr. Black, who was the company&#8217;s chairman, to sell hundreds of small Hollinger-owned community newspapers across the United States and Canada. Millions of dollars were paid to Hollinger in exchange for promises that it would not go into competition with the new owners of the papers. Prosecutors say that Mr. Black and two of his co-defendants, the former Hollinger vice presidents John A. Boultbee and Peter Y. Atkinson, illegally diverted much of the money to themselves with help from the corporate counsel, Mark S. Kipnis. Mr. Kipnis is also on trial. The prosecution rested its case amid bickering over 13 boxes that Mr. Black removed from the company&#8217;s headquarters in Toronto late in the afternoon of May 20, 2005, in defiance of a court order. On Wednesday, jurors saw pictures captured by security cameras of Mr. Black hauling the boxes out of the headquarters building and loading them into a waiting limousine. Mr. Black, who is charged with obstruction of justice in the incident, was forced to return the boxes, which sat on an evidence cart next to the jury box while the jurors viewed the security camera photos on a large screen. Judge St. Eve gave both sides until next Tuesday to file briefs expanding on their arguments. A defense lawyer for Mr. Black, Marc Martin, said he would ask her to drop other counts as well.

The Empire State Development Corporation selected Saatchi & Saatchi in New York, part of the , to handle the campaign. The decision, announced yesterday by Gov. , came after a required review that began in February. The budget for the campaign for 2007-8 will be increased 50 percent, to $16 million, Mr. Spitzer said. There will also be efforts to expand the types of media in which the campaign appears beyond traditional ones like television and print, reflecting the increasing use of the Internet by consumers making travel plans. The I Love New York campaign has been handled since December 2003 by the Albany office of Eric Mower & Associates. Mower was the first upstate agency to handle the assignment, which has had 11 agencies since its introduction 30 years ago. Mower decided in March not to take part in the review. Saatchi & Saatchi was awarded a three-year contract for the assignment, with a two-year renewal option. Room - 1918
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31vioxx.html 3rd Trial Is Ordered in Vioxx Death Case Trial Is Ordered in Vioxx Death Case THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ORLEANS, May 30 (AP) — A federal judge has ordered a third trial in a lawsuit by a woman who blamed ’s painkiller Vioxx for the heart attack that killed her husband. A cardiologist who testified for Merck misrepresented his qualifications in the second trial last year, Judge Eldon E. Fallon of the Eastern District of Louisiana ruled. Jurors in that trial ruled in favor of Merck and against Evelyn Irvin Plunkett, whose first husband, Richard Irvin Jr., died of a heart attack after taking Vioxx for less than a month. The ruling was signed Tuesday, but was made available on the Internet a day later. The first trial, held in Houston during November and December 2005, ended with the jury deadlocked 8 to 1 in Merck’s favor, two jurors told The Associated Press. The cardiologist, Dr. Barry Rayburn, a professor of medicine at the , Birmingham, who was hired by Merck as a $600-an-hour expert witness, testified in the second trial that the drug could not have caused Mr. Irvin’s heart attack. Dr. Rayburn testified then that he was board-certified in cardiovascular disease. When Merck brought Dr. Rayburn as a witness in a second Vioxx trial, in a state court case in New Jersey, however, he testified during cross-examination that his board certification had lapsed. The ruling will not affect other cases because Dr. Rayburn took the board examinations for recertification last summer, has testified in only those two cases and has since been recertified, his lawyer said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/worldbusiness/31chinastox.html Tax Increase Batters Chinese Stocks, but There&#8217;s Little Wider Damage Increase Batters Chinese Stocks, but There’s Little Wider Damage Mark Ralston/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images Investors intently studied a stock price board at a securities firm in Shanghai Wednesday as share values dropped sharply. Earlier, the government, seeking to rein in speculation, tripled the tax on trading stamps. Thursday, May 31 — Chinese stock markets plummeted Wednesday and continued their decline in early trading Thursday after the authorities in Beijing moved to impose higher taxes on trading activity. Skip to next paragraph The tax increase, which was announced early Wednesday, was the government’s latest attempt to rein in the world’s hottest stock market as a growing number of economists and analysts warn about the danger of a market bubble. Investors reacted by selling shares and pushing the benchmark indexes on the two main stock exchanges sharply lower. The Shanghai composite index plunged 6.5 percent, to 4,053.09. The Shenzhen composite index dropped nearly 7.2 percent, to 1,199.45. At midday Thursday, the Shanghai exchange was down nearly 3 percent from Wednesday’s close and the Shenzhen 5 percent. When Chinese shares fell sharply at the end of February, markets around the world tumbled in tandem on worries of broader trouble ahead for the nation’s economy. But on Wednesday, other Asian markets were down only modestly. The benchmark Hang Seng index in Hong Kong declined 0.86 percent Wednesday, and in Tokyo the Nikkei index of 225 issues slid a little less than 0.5 percent. In its move Wednesday, the Chinese finance ministry tripled the tax on stock transactions to 0.3 percent, which analysts said was probably not enough to destroy the bull market, though it could dampen the mood of speculators. “The psychological impact on investors could be larger than the actual effect of the duty adjustment,” Shen Minggao, an economist at , wrote in a research note. Most analysts said they did not think that a sharp drop in stock prices would harm the Chinese economy, which continues to grow robustly. Some said they expected the markets to resume their climb quickly unless the government announced further measures. “If the market expectation is that share prices are going to rise 50 percent in the next six months, then the transaction tax is affordable,” said Dong Tao, chief Asia economist at The tax was increased at a time many Chinese seem to have gone mad for stocks. Professionals, retirees, shop owners, students — even watermelon hawkers — are said to be lining up to buy stocks in hopes of getting in on the rally. More than 300,000 accounts are being opened every day, regulators say. Brokerage houses are overrun with day traders and people who pack lunches to spend the day staring at stock price monitors. One indication of the mood is a popular cellphone greeting that is being sent around Shanghai. The greeting replaces the national anthem with a call for all investors to rise up and buy, buy, buy stocks. “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves” from the national anthem has been replaced by: “Arise, ye who haven’t opened an account! Pour your gold and silver into the hot market.” Chinese seem eager to buy stocks not only because they have watched prices soar in the last two years, but also because there are few other opportunities to get a good return on investments. Until the past year, much of the speculative money in China was going into real estate, particularly in Shanghai and Beijing. Policy makers chilled real estate speculation with a series of tax and administrative measures, only to see the speculation move into stocks. Many investors are betting almost everything on stocks. Some said that even the sell-off on Wednesday was unlikely to restrain optimism. “There are too many small investors in the market,” said Fan Ligen, a retired Shanghai clerk who has been investing in stocks since 1992. “They are like hundreds of ants swarming on pieces of meat on the ground.” In the February sell-off, prices plummeted 8.8 percent after the Shanghai composite index surpassed the 3,000-point level for the first time. It was the biggest one-day drop in a decade. But with prices down, new investors rushed in, sensing an opportunity to buy on the cheap. They were right. In mid-March, the Shanghai index retraced its losses, again exceeding 3,000. Early this month, it passed 4,000. This week, it was pushing toward 4,400 on record volume. “Our market is different from the ones Japan,” said Li Wenwei, a banker who was at a brokerage house in Shanghai. “Those markets obey the rules of the market, while ours doesn’t. There are bubbles in the market. The index is already too high, and there is a lot of risk in the market.” In many ways, the stock market has come into line with China’s phenomenal economic growth, a bullish market to match a bullish economy that is growing close to 11 percent a year, creating worries about the possibility of hypergrowth and inflation, a stock market crash and, potentially, civil unrest. The rise is extraordinary. Since July 2005, when a bearish market turned bullish, share prices have soared in Shanghai by more than 300 percent and 400 percent in Shenzhen, even with Wednesday’s drop. That decline, though, was especially sharp — given regulations that no single stock rise or fall more than 10 percent in a trading day. Some stocks fell the limit Wednesday, and questions arose whether they might continue dropping Thursday. “I think the market will still go down a bit tomorrow,” Mr. Li, the banker in Shanghai, said. “My two stocks fell today. But I won’t sell them yet. I’m not nervous about the fall since my investment is from my savings.” David Barboza reported from Shanghai and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.

CBS, one of the nation’s biggest radio broadcasters, said the founders of the five-year-old service would continue to operate it as an independent unit. But the purchase is also regarded as a way for CBS to grab an audience online at a time when many traditional radio stations fear losing listeners to iPods, Internet radio and other competing media. The sale of Last.FM comes as the profitability of online radio has been called into question. A recent ruling by the federal Copyright Royalty Board, which establishes royalty rates for Internet-based broadcasters that stream music online, would raise the existing rates significantly. CBS said the deal provided an opportunity to extend its reach online, including adding some of its own programming to Last.FM. As it stands, the site attracts more than 15 million users worldwide, with big audiences in the United States, Britain and Germany. CBS, which also owns the CBS television network, has also purchased Wallstrip.com, a business-oriented site built around online video and blogging, and has invested in Joost, an online video service.

The Justice Department said in a statement that the company’s actions had threatened to reduce competition for the drug, one of the best-selling prescription medications worldwide. Government investigators said that a former senior executive had made “oral representations” to a Canadian generic drug maker, Apotex, that caused Apotex to conclude that Bristol-Myers would not introduce its own generic version of Plavix. At the time, the two companies were locked in litigation over the validity of the patent for Plavix. Bristol-Myers, however, was subject to a consent decree that required it to submit any patent settlements for review with the Federal Trade Commission. The government said that Bristol-Myers had also lied to the government about the arrangement. The government inquiry is still open. The patent deal’s failure led to the ouster of Bristol-Myers’s chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, in September.

People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sought the assurances after discovering studies financed by the companies that used animals like rats and chimpanzees to test taste perception and, in some cases, to bolster support for promotional health claims. PepsiCo said that it would stop directly financing animal experiments, including some it had financed through grants given to graduate students through its Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Elaine Palmer, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, said that while the company had never supported the idea of animal testing, “We had not been policing it, so that part is new.” Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are the largest largest manufacturers to agree to the ban. Coca-Cola also said that it would discontinue a grant given to a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University who has been studying taste perception in rats, which share certain taste pathways with humans. Representatives of Coca-Cola and the university declined to say how much financing the company was providing or to elaborate on what the ultimate application of the research might be. A research associate at PETA, Shalin G. Gala, said, “We see these statements from Coke and Pepsi, massive global conglomerates, as the beginning of the end of all animal tests on food.” Scientists conducting basic research in animal models have cautioned against PETA’s hard line, saying their work, which may have medical benefits, would not be possible in many cases without help from corporate sponsors. “It’s very easy to characterize scientific research like this in a bad light,” said Dr. John A. DeSimone, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who had been working under the Coca-Cola grant. “To do medical research, you sometimes need an animal model.” Not everyone agrees with Dr. DeSimone’s thinking, particularly when it involves tests on highly intelligent animals, as did a study involving a Coca-Cola scientist, financed by Nutrasweet, that cut open the faces of chimpanzees to study nerve impulses used in the perception of sweet tastes. “I have never found chimpanzee work justifiable,” said Dr. Alan Goldberg, director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Dr. Goldberg said that over the last 30 years, advances in alternatives to animal models, many of which are usually more scientifically precise, have already reduced the number of lab animals in use by 50 percent. “The bottom line for me is that I’d love to see animal studies disappear entirely,” Dr. Goldberg said. “In vitro models are cleaner.” The two soft drink giants are the latest companies to respond to scrutiny by PETA, which has mounted a campaign to denounce animal testing practices in the beverage industry, an industry that, unlike cosmetics or pharmaceuticals, had largely been unpublicized in the animal testing arena. In January, Roll International, the company that makes Pom Wonderful pomegranate juice, agreed to cease tests on animals after PETA disclosed a 2005 study financed by the company that tested the juice to see if it might relieve artificially induced erectile dysfunction in rabbits.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31cantor.html Cantor Fitzgerald Sells Unit to eSpeed Fitzgerald Sells Unit to eSpeed THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Fitzgerald, the bond-trading firm, is selling its privately held BGC Partners brokerage unit to , the publicly owned electronic trading house controlled by Cantor, in a deal valued at $1.3 billion. The acquisition will allow Cantor to consolidate its interdealer broker businesses and end all revenue-sharing agreements with eSpeed, which some eSpeed investors had criticized. But Cantor is retaining voting control over the new company, which will be called BGC Partners and trade on the . BGC had made a $460 million initial public offering proposal earlier this year, which it will now withdraw. ESpeed, used to trade primarily United States Treasuries, will issue 133,860,000 shares of its common stock and rights to acquire shares of BGC’s common stock. BGC, which had first-quarter revenue of $249 million, is valued at approximately $1.23 billion, based on the closing price of eSpeed’s stock Tuesday. Shares of eSpeed rose 4 cents, to $9.23. The deal will do little to make BCG and eSpeed more competitive against the market leaders, Icap and Tullett, said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of consulting firm Celent, noting that the move is more about simplifying the “bizarre, triangular” relationship among Cantor, BGC and eSpeed. He added that if Cantor has voting control, it makes the deal less attractive to investors. The combined company’s 2007 projected revenue is expected to be approximately $1 billion. For 2008, the combined company’s projected revenue is expected to increase by more than 12 percent to over $1.1 billion, the companies said.

Index Climbs Past the Record It Set 7 Years Ago Traders at the New York Stock Exchange were busy Wednesday as the S.& P. hit a record high. stock market yesterday clawed back to where it was seven years ago during the heady days of technology and the Internet boom — and it had to overcome an overnight sell-off in China to get there. Skip to next paragraph What Took So Long? which struggled for much of the day after markets fell in Asia and Europe, received a midafternoon boost from the minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting that indicated that policy makers had become somewhat more upbeat about the economy. The tone of the minutes, if not the substance, heartened investors, who sent the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the most widely followed benchmark of American stocks, past a level last reached on March 24, 2000. The index — a weighted measure of the biggest American companies, from — gained 0.8 percent, or 12.12 points, to 1,530.23, surpassing the record of 1,527.46. The S.& P. climbed past the record early last week, too, but failed to hold onto the gains until the end of regular trading as it did yesterday. The industrial average, which has been breaking records with some regularity in the last several months, closed up 111.74 points, or 0.83 percent, to 13,633.08, another record. composite index rose 20.53 points yesterday, or 0.8 percent, to 2,592.59. The Nasdaq has yet to come close to regaining the levels reached during the Internet boom. It is down 49 percent from its March 2000 high. The S.& P. breakthrough was set on a day that began with worries about a bubble in Chinese stocks. The stock market in Shanghai tumbled 6.5 percent yesterday after the government in Beijing trebled the taxes on stock transactions in an effort to rein in what has become the world’s hottest stock market. In February, the Shanghai market precipitated a wave of selling on markets around the world after a similar sell-off. But after a brief period of uncertainty in late February and early March, investors have been pushing American stocks steadily upward. This time, the nervousness was much shorter-lived. “If we see a 20 or 30 percent decline in the Shanghai index, that will cause investors to sit up and take notice,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s, said yesterday. “Basically, investors say, ‘You’ve got to increase the shock value, not merely replicate it to get my attention the second time around.’ ” The United States market has been supported by a strong flow of corporate takeovers, companies buying back their own shares and corporate earnings that are proving to be better than expected. That optimism appears to be overshadowing, at least for now, concerns about the slowing American economy, rising energy prices, a modest increase in interest rates and the troubles in the housing market. “We have a remarkably positive environment for securities,” said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. “You have 5 percent real world G.D.P. growth right now and you have massive excessive liquidity sloshing around.” According to minutes of the Fed meeting on May 9, officials seemed to think that the economic outlook had improved somewhat, even as they acknowledged that the housing market and the problems in subprime mortgages would serve as a bigger drag on the economy than they had previously thought. But the minutes reiterated, as statements from the Fed have for many months now, that policy makers remain concerned that inflation is too high and too unsettled to warrant a change in policy, which has been to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at 5.25 percent. There are also signs that the recent moderation in inflation could be threatened by rising gasoline prices, which have climbed past $3 a gallon for the first time since last summer. Still, investors appeared willing to look past the Fed’s concerns about housing and inflation, two staple worries that while they have raised eyebrows have not yet sapped corporate profits or the frenzied deal-making on Wall Street. While the outlook for profits is not as ebullient as it was in the last several years, it remains reasonably upbeat. Low interest rates have also ensured that businesses still have easy access to credit. (The 4.87 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has risen in the last two months, is still historically low.) & Poor's 500-Stock Index Economic Conditions and Trends in the Fog - 1992

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/washington/31zoellick.html Bush&#8217;s Nominee Has New Agenda for Bank Nominee Has New Agenda for Bank Pool photo by Roger Wollenberg President Bush nominated Robert B. Zoellick, left, yesterday to lead the World Bank. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. is at right. A scandal forced out the departing bank president, Paul D. Wolfowitz. May 30 &#151; The stands ready to inherit may be battered, fractious and rudderless. But he said Wednesday that he saw himself not simply as a healer but as a leader ready to establish a new agenda to help the world&#8217;s poor. &#8220;On the one hand, one has to calm the waters,&#8221; Mr. Zoellick told reporters in the afternoon. &#8220;But one also has to start to navigate the course of the future.&#8221; At another point he said, &#8220;People in the bank recognize that it&#8217;s going to have to go through some mission adjustment.&#8221; But he declined to specify details. People close to Mr. Zoellick say that based on his record in past economic and diplomatic jobs, he is likely to bring a demanding approach that could disturb the status quo. At his session with journalists, Mr. Zoellick signaled that he would retain and build on the anticorruption policies of the departing president, , who resigned nearly two weeks ago after a furor over charges of favoritism. Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s nomination was formally announced Wednesday at the White House, where President Bush praised him for having &#8220;earned the trust and support of leaders from every region of the world.&#8221; Mr. Bush also praised Mr. Wolfowitz for making the bank &#8220;a more effective partner for development.&#8221; The bank&#8217;s 24-member board has welcomed Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s nomination but said it would accept other nominations until June 15. But bank officials dismissed the statement as a formality and predicted that the board would move smoothly toward making Mr. Zoellick president, despite reservations by some about the United States&#8217; continuing to exercise its 60-year-old prerogative of filling the job. European officials said they would not disturb the arrangement of having the American president picking the head of the bank, in part to leave intact the tradition of having Europeans pick the head of the Mr. Zoellick has been told by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and others that the bank must do more to provide concrete measures of the effects of its $23 billion in lending to poor countries, in part to assure Congress about how the money is being spent. In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Zoellick also suggested that the international community must rethink having the bank provide loans to countries like China that have access to global capital markets and possess huge foreign exchange reserves. The bank, he said, could move more into providing technical assistance to these countries. &#8220;It would have been easy to get a figurehead,&#8221; an administration official involved in the selection process said of Mr. Zoellick. &#8220;Bob&#8217;s first posture at the bank will be to listen and to travel. But he definitely brings some ideas on development. He has thought about it a lot.&#8221; Others who know Mr. Zoellick say that despite having a reputation for being a brusque and demanding executive, he is also good at setting long-term objectives and building consensus. &#8220;The World Bank, like other international organizations, needs substantial reform,&#8221; said former Secretary of State James A. Baker III , who helped bring Mr. Zoellick into government in the 1980s. &#8220;I think Bob will be a very good agent of change. It&#8217;s a huge, humongous bureaucracy. But he&#8217;s a very resourceful person.&#8221; Colleagues noted that Mr. Zoellick brought &#8220;tough love&#8221; to some of his previous jobs, most notably as United States trade representative during Mr. Bush&#8217;s first term. As trade envoy, Mr. Zoellick worked with Europeans in 2001, shortly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, to make the next round of global trade talks focus on helping poor countries by letting them export more farm products and industrial goods to rich countries. But he also demanded that poor countries that gained from being able to export more also commit themselves to economic reforms. &#8220;He believes in rewarding opportunity, encouraging small business and frankly reducing the power of entrenched oligarchies that thrive on closed markets and corrupt environments,&#8221; said Christopher A. Padilla, Mr. Zoellick&#8217;s chief of staff at the trade office and when he was deputy secretary of state. &#8220;That agenda was a very important component of what we were trying to achieve,&#8221; said Mr. Padilla, now an assistant secretary of commerce for export administration. &#8220;I&#8217;m confident he will bring the same agenda to the World Bank.&#8221; There are some at the World Bank, many bank officials say, who may resist a bias toward encouraging free-market economies, especially at a time when faith in that philosophy has faded in Latin America and elsewhere. But bank officials said they would welcome a new president with knowledge in this area. &#8220;A lot of people used to think that if the Democrats win the White House in 2008, we might get a new president who won&#8217;t be pursing free markets and corruption,&#8221; said one bank official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. &#8220;But most people at the bank also realize that reform is necessary.&#8221; The official added: &#8220;Sure, Zoellick is coming with an agenda. People at the bank will be focusing on whether he is going to be fixated on trade. But he&#8217;s a basic policy wonk. He&#8217;s actually a lot closer in personality to the typical bank staffer than Wolfowitz was.&#8221; More Articles in Washington Envoy Is Bush&#8217;s Choice for World Bank Rice's Deputy Intends to Resign, Aides Say Fiorina Called Candidate for World Bank Trade Envoy Is Favorite to Lead World Bank More Articles in Washington NORTH POLE WAS HERE
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/smallbusiness/31sbiz.html Small Business Not as Usual Business Not as Usual Andrew Councill for A. Little, president of B&W Solutions, a personnel management firm in Oxon Hill, Md., said dealing with the Small Business Administration was frustrating, &#147;and after a while you don&#146;t even bother asking.&#148; Kain, a small-business owner in Fremont, Calif., started her packaging services business, ALOM Technologies, in 1997 with a $250,000 loan. In 2000, her 70-employee company was singled out as an entrepreneurial success by the agency, complete with a ceremony in San Francisco. Skip to next paragraph But in 2003, when she lost a government contract to package and distribute informational CDs to military bases around the world, she didn’t bother to turn to the S.B.A. for help. “I’m not so sure about the overall competency level and the ability to follow through,” Ms. Kain said. “The best you can expect is a list of government agencies you can contact.” Her assessment reflects a growing frustration among many small-business owners with the agency. Over the last five decades, the S.B.A. has been there to propel the likes of Federal Express, , Staples and thousands of lesser-known small businesses. But advocates say recent policy changes and severe budget and staffing cuts in the last six years have left the agency unable to fulfill its mission to provide programs and services to the nation’s 25 million small companies, which the agency defines as businesses with 500 or fewer workers. Since 2001, the agency’s budget has been sliced nearly in half, to $464 million in the proposed 2008 budget. Staff cuts have been almost as deep, with the agency losing 31 percent of its work force. Nowhere has the impact of these changes been felt more than in the S.B.A.’s primary loan program for small businesses, known as 7(a). Since the 2005 fiscal year, the agency has cut funding to the program and restored an earlier, more costly fee structure for borrowers. Now a borrower pays a minimum of $2,000 in upfront fees for the smaller loans up to $150,000, a rise from $1,000 before. For larger loans up to $700,000, the fee now is 3 percent, up from 2.5 percent before. For loans above $700,000, the fee remains unchanged at 3.5 percent. Even with the higher fees, the agency says, the loans have easier credit terms and longer repayment periods than those typically available at commercial banks. But many small-business advocates say that is a moot point as many small businesses cannot even pull together the amounts to cover the fees. The S.B.A. has also proposed raising the fees in its microloan program, which can be used for construction and expansion of facilities. Together these loans totaled $20 billion in 2006, according to the S.B.A. While fees for the loans have increased, the average size of the loans under the 7(a) and microloan programs has decreased 25 percent, to $188,878 in fiscal year 2006, from $252,314 in fiscal year 2001, according to data from the S.B.A. The total number of loans has more than doubled, however. The S.B.A. said that part of the reason that the average amount of the loans has dropped is because a number of banks use a process called S.B.A. Express. For it, banks use their own documents and need less interaction with the agency. The S.B.A guarantees only 50 percent of these loans instead of the 75 percent to 85 percent on larger loans. The increased fees for the loans may have had another effect. The number of banks participating has dropped by nearly half, to 2,751 in fiscal 2006, from 5,228 in fiscal 2001, according to the National Small Business Association in Washington. The association said some of the drop may reflect bank consolidation, but fees and other changes in the 7(a) program had the biggest impact. Because of the higher fees, many entrepreneurs have turned to a growing credit card market aimed at small-business owners. A survey by the association found that the overwhelming majority of small businesses use credit cards for their financing instead of S.B.A or other bank loans — meaning that the interest rate paid can be as much as 10 percentage points more than a conventional loan. “The S.B.A. in many ways is hurting small business by increasing these fees,” said Marilyn Landis, owner of Basic Business Concepts, a small company in Pittsburgh, who relies on credit cards for most of her financing. “The decrease in the size of the loans is certainly a detriment to small companies — it’s barely enough to get a company started and certainly not enough to grow one.” Ms. Landis is vice chairwoman of the National Small Business Association. Even more than the higher fees, reduced staffing levels at the agency have had a profound effect on small business, advocates say. the List: Health Care and Pay JOB CAMP; How to Walk a Mile in Your Dream Career House Committee to Examine Recent Performance of S.B.A. HOME FRONT; Helping Small Businesses Get Bigger BUSINESS RESOURCE CENTER Marketing & Advertising &raquo; Operations & Technology &raquo; Retail & Franchising &raquo; Taylor - 1985

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/technology/31yahoo.html Yahoo Technology Chief to Leave in Wake of Company Revamping Technology Chief to Leave in Wake of Company Revamping FRANCISCO, May 30 — Farzad Nazem, ’s chief technology officer and one of its longest-serving executives, said he would leave on June 8 after 11 years at the company. Yahoo said its co-founder, Jerry Yang, would assume Mr. Nazem’s responsibilities while it searches for a replacement. The departure of Mr. Nazem, 45, who is known as Zod, will follow a turbulent year at Yahoo that included a companywide revamping. Several other senior executives, including the chief operating officer, have left in the wake of the overhaul. Yahoo would not make Mr. Nazem or any other executive available to discuss his departure. But a spokeswoman, Joanna Stevens, said that Mr. Nazem had wanted to retire and that he and the chief executive, Terry S. Semel, had been planning his departure for some time. Writing in the company’s , Mr. Nazem said, “As I began contemplating retirement, there were a few milestones that I (along with the executive leadership team) wanted to accomplish prior to my departure.” Those milestones, he wrote, included the reorganization of the company and its technology group, as well as the introduction of an advertising platform, known as Project Panama, which Yahoo began introducing in February. “It was very important to me,” Mr. Nazem said, “to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo without distractions of an announcement like this.” The new advertising platform is aimed at narrowing the lead of in online advertising, but it has yet to translate into financial gains for the company. Mr. Nazem, who is responsible for the operation of the Yahoo Web site and for product development, was popular among the company’s technology ranks, whom he largely helped hire. This month, Yahoo appointed Blake Jorgensen, a founder of Thomas Weisel Partners, as chief financial officer, replacing Susan L. Decker, who is switching roles to become head of the company’s advertiser and publisher group. Yahoo is looking for an executive to lead its audience group, which is responsible for much of the main company Web site. After Mr. Nazem’s departure, Yahoo is likely to have vacant positions at the top of two of its three operating units. As part of his separation agreement, Mr. Nazem will receive a lump sum equal to his base salary for the rest of the year as well as accelerated vesting of stock options and stock awards, a package that an executive compensation firm, Equilar, estimated around $6.9 million.

You could have been a computer disk. Skip to next paragraph Backing Up Your Files The current Iomega Rev drive takes 70-gigabyte cartridges and also accepts the 35-gigabyte cartridges of the original 2004 model. The Dell PowerVault RD 1000 and an 80-gigabyte cartridge, above. The cartridge contains a complete shock-mounted hard drive. The history of removable disks is one sad “couldn’t keep up” story after another. Remember the floppy disk (800 kilobytes)? The SyQuest cartridge (44 megabytes)? The Zip disk (100 megabytes)? The Jaz disk (1 gigabyte)? The recordable DVD (4.7 gigabytes)? Each one seemed at first like a handy system for making backups and transporting files. But as computer hard drives grew, those removable disks wound up looking pathetically puny. Nowadays, it’s not unusual for a new computer to come with a 320-gigabyte hard drive. Are you really going to back it up onto 68 blank DVDs? Or 444,431 floppies? It’s been years since there was a cartridge system on every desk. But like the hip-huggers, side ponytails and other fads of the 1980s, removables are making a comeback. At least three companies — , Quantum and ProStor —now offer cartridge systems that are just as convenient and transportable as Zip disks once were, but big enough to back up a hard drive. That’s because the cartridges actually Your initial outlay is for the drive itself. Each company makes both an internal model, which is installed inside a computer, and an external one that sits on the desk and connects with a U.S.B. cable. The price is fairly high; for example, the external Rev drive from Iomega costs about $500, the external GoVault from Quantum will cost around $370 when it hits stores in July, and an external RDX drive is on special from Dell for $300. Each drive includes one starter cartridge. (ProStor doesn’t actually sell its RDX systems. Instead, it created the design for RDX drives, which are manufactured and sold interchangeably by companies like Dell, , Tandberg and Exabyte under their own names. The Dell model I tested is called the PowerVault RD 1000.) The drive itself is just a dock with electronics and power circuitry. Into this shell, you slide the interchangeable cartridges that contain your data. All three drives leave one cartridge edge exposed — the edge with the label, so you can see which cartridge is currently inserted. The edge of an RDX cartridge (not just the drive) also bears a status light, which makes life much easier if troubleshooting is ever required. Once inserted, the cartridge behaves exactly like a hard drive. You can add and remove files by dragging and dropping, or by using an automated backup program. Backup software is included with all three drives. Quantum’s superb backup program, for example, crams more onto your cartridges using “de-duplication” — storing only new sections of documents you’ve already backed up. The drives are silent and fast. On a Windows PC, copying a 1.5-gigabyte folder full of large and small files took 80 seconds on the Quantum, and 90 seconds on the Rev and RDX drives. The Quantum GoVault and RDX cartridges both come in several sizes, ranging from 40 to 160 gigabytes. It’s very cool how a single drive can accommodate cartridges of all different capacities, present and future. Iomega, on the other hand, intends to keep releasing new drives to accommodate larger-capacity cartridges. The current drive takes 70-gigabyte cartridges. It also accepts the 35-gig cartridges of its original 2004 Rev drive, but “plays” them much slower. The Quantum and RDX cartridges (both 4.5 by 3.5 by 1 inch) are incredibly rugged. They’re intended to be handled, tossed, shipped and even dropped. They can shrug off one-meter drops onto concrete — a claim my kids and I had a glorious time investigating. The RDX cartridges even have what the company calls a static-dissipation system. The tiny Rev cartridges (3 by 3 by 0.4 inch) are built differently. Whereas each Quantum and RDX cartridge is a complete, sealed, shock-mounted 2.5-inch hard drive, the Rev cartridge contains only the spinning platter and the motor; the delicate stuff, like the read-write heads (the “needle” that plays the disk) are in the drive. As a result, Rev cartridges are slightly less tough; they can handle only three-foot drops onto “industrial carpet.” Still, anyone who nervously recalls the “click of death” that occasionally haunted Iomega’s previous systems, like Zip and Jaz, should be reassured; Rev drives have been on the market since 2004 (Iomega says that it has sold over a million cartridges), and even a search fails to reveal any Jaz-like community of bereaved customers with failed cartridges. Rev is also the only product that works on both Mac and Windows, and the only one available in both U.S.B.-connector and FireWire-connector editions. These cartridge systems sound great, right? Fast, tough, capacious — what more could you ask? You’ll pay $100 for Quantum’s 40-gigabyte cartridge and $305 for a 160-gig cartridge. The RDX cartridges are priced similarly, ranging from $118 (40 gigabytes) to $270 (160 gigs). Sorry, but that’s just nuts. For a fraction of that price, you could just buy a big old hard drive. These days, a 250-gigabyte internal drive costs about $66, for heaven’s sake. Of course, the beauty of the cartridges is that they’re transportable. A proper backup system involves storing a copy of your data off site, not in your office. So a more apt comparison would be with those little pocket hard drives — external U.S.B. drives like Seagate’s FreeAgent Go or ’s Pocket Media drive. But these, too, cost less than cartridges. A 120-gigabyte pocket hard drive costs about $85 — about one-third the price of the same-size Quantum cartridge. Iomega Rev cartridges are much more reasonably priced: $270 for a five-pack, which comes to about $54 each. They’re the only reasonable option for people whose last name isn’t “Inc.” Even so, that’s 77 cents per gigabyte, compared with 71 cents for a self-contained pocket hard drive. (You don’t even want to know the Quantum and RDX cost per gigabyte. All right, maybe you do: $2.03 and $1.70, respectively. And I’m not even counting the price of the drive itself.) So what, exactly, is the value proposition here? All three companies emphatically stress that their products are not intended for everyday desktop storage. Instead, these systems are supposed to be highly reliable backup machines for businesses. They are primarily intended to replace tape backup drives, which thousands of small businesses use to back up their computers. Sure enough, compared with these cartridges, tape backup systems are unreliable, high maintenance and even more expensive. You don’t have random instant access to files — the tape literally has to rewind or fast-forward to find a certain file — and tracking and managing the tapes themselves are a headache. Well, fine. If that’s the cartridge companies’ narrowly defined mission — replacing tape backup systems for businesses — then congratulations to them; they’ve succeeded. But the technology in these systems, including their speed, convenience, silence, compactness and reliability, is terrific. If it weren’t for the nosebleed pricing, cartridge systems would find a huge and happy home among everyday computer users. Think of all the photographers, music buffs and video editors who would love to hot-swap 160-gigabyte cartridges on the fly, ready to toss in the briefcase or cram into a envelope. Think of how great it would be to create a snapshot of your entire hard drive every few days, creating a rotating cartridge system that would mean you’re always backed up and safe.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31mcdonalds.html 3 Claims Dismissed Against McDonald&#8217;s Claims Dismissed Against McDonald’s dismissal yesterday of three out of five claims in a lawsuit over allergens said to be in French fries and hash browns. Judge Elaine E. Bucklo of Federal District Court in Chicago said the plaintiffs’ complaint did not give enough detail about a supposed scheme by the company to conceal the existence of gluten and dairy in its food products. Judge Bucklo allowed two claims on breach of warranty and unjust enrichment to proceed. The suit had sought to force the company to change food product information in its advertising. Lawyers for McDonald’s, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., asked the court to throw out the lawsuit in November, referring to the plaintiffs as a few “hypersensitive consumers with allergies.” The complaint was filed by 11 people who accused McDonald’s of concealing allergens until it was forced to disclose them by a change in food-labeling laws.

Index Climbs Past the Record It Set 7 Years Ago Traders at the New York Stock Exchange were busy Wednesday as the S.& P. hit a record high. stock market yesterday clawed back to where it was seven years ago during the heady days of technology and the Internet boom — and it had to overcome an overnight sell-off in China to get there. Skip to next paragraph What Took So Long? which struggled for much of the day after markets fell in Asia and Europe, received a midafternoon boost from the minutes of a Federal Reserve meeting that indicated that policy makers had become somewhat more upbeat about the economy. The tone of the minutes, if not the substance, heartened investors, who sent the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, the most widely followed benchmark of American stocks, past a level last reached on March 24, 2000. The index — a weighted measure of the biggest American companies, from — gained 0.8 percent, or 12.12 points, to 1,530.23, surpassing the record of 1,527.46. The S.& P. climbed past the record early last week, too, but failed to hold onto the gains until the end of regular trading as it did yesterday. The industrial average, which has been breaking records with some regularity in the last several months, closed up 111.74 points, or 0.83 percent, to 13,633.08, another record. composite index rose 20.53 points yesterday, or 0.8 percent, to 2,592.59. The Nasdaq has yet to come close to regaining the levels reached during the Internet boom. It is down 49 percent from its March 2000 high. The S.& P. breakthrough was set on a day that began with worries about a bubble in Chinese stocks. The stock market in Shanghai tumbled 6.5 percent yesterday after the government in Beijing trebled the taxes on stock transactions in an effort to rein in what has become the world’s hottest stock market. In February, the Shanghai market precipitated a wave of selling on markets around the world after a similar sell-off. But after a brief period of uncertainty in late February and early March, investors have been pushing American stocks steadily upward. This time, the nervousness was much shorter-lived. “If we see a 20 or 30 percent decline in the Shanghai index, that will cause investors to sit up and take notice,” Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor’s, said yesterday. “Basically, investors say, ‘You’ve got to increase the shock value, not merely replicate it to get my attention the second time around.’ ” The United States market has been supported by a strong flow of corporate takeovers, companies buying back their own shares and corporate earnings that are proving to be better than expected. That optimism appears to be overshadowing, at least for now, concerns about the slowing American economy, rising energy prices, a modest increase in interest rates and the troubles in the housing market. “We have a remarkably positive environment for securities,” said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist for Wells Capital Management. “You have 5 percent real world G.D.P. growth right now and you have massive excessive liquidity sloshing around.” According to minutes of the Fed meeting on May 9, officials seemed to think that the economic outlook had improved somewhat, even as they acknowledged that the housing market and the problems in subprime mortgages would serve as a bigger drag on the economy than they had previously thought. But the minutes reiterated, as statements from the Fed have for many months now, that policy makers remain concerned that inflation is too high and too unsettled to warrant a change in policy, which has been to leave short-term interest rates unchanged at 5.25 percent. There are also signs that the recent moderation in inflation could be threatened by rising gasoline prices, which have climbed past $3 a gallon for the first time since last summer. Still, investors appeared willing to look past the Fed’s concerns about housing and inflation, two staple worries that while they have raised eyebrows have not yet sapped corporate profits or the frenzied deal-making on Wall Street. While the outlook for profits is not as ebullient as it was in the last several years, it remains reasonably upbeat. Low interest rates have also ensured that businesses still have easy access to credit. (The 4.87 percent yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which has risen in the last two months, is still historically low.) & Poor's 500-Stock Index Economic Conditions and Trends POPULAR - BUSINESS Bumped Fliers and No Plan B Economix: Truth, Fiction and Lou Dobbs In India, Grandma Cooks, They Deliver Is Wal-Mart Too Cheap for Its Own Good?

Skip to next paragraph Text of the Indictment The firm itself was not charged. But the indictment against the four, which was announced yesterday, did not mean that Ernst & Young, which has been under investigation since 2004, was entirely off the hook in a widening criminal investigation of the web of banks, accounting firms, law firms and investment boutiques that promoted questionable shelters. Those shelters have turned out to be bogus in the eyes of the , and prosecutors contend that they were shams or frauds that deprived the government of billions of dollars in tax revenue from the late 1990s through recent years. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said yesterday that their investigation was continuing. The four Ernst & Young employees — Robert Coplan, who is also a former I.R.S. official, Richard Shapiro, Martin Nissenbaum and Brian Vaughan — were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on eight charges including conspiracy to defraud the I.R.S., tax evasion, making false statements to the I.R.S., and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the I.R.S. from 1998 through 2004. James Tucker, a lawyer for Mr. Vaughan, declined to comment yesterday. A lawyer for Mr. Nissenbaum said yesterday in a statement that his client had entered a plea of not guilty and “did not engage in any unlawful activity.” Jack Tigue, a lawyer for Mr. Shapiro, could not be reached for immediate comment. Lawyers for the other men did not return calls for comment. If convicted, each faces as much as 18 years in prison. The charges come nearly four years after Ernst & Young reached a settlement with the I.R.S., paying a $15 million penalty to resolve a civil investigation into the firm over its design and sales of questionable shelters. The civil settlement, however, did not prevent Ernst & Young from a criminal investigation less than one year later, as federal scrutiny of a rival accounting firm, KPMG, intensified, and as prosecutors made progress in teasing out the links between the web of firms that promoted tax shelters. But the 2003 settlement may make a criminal case against the firm more difficult. “Once you’ve got a civil settlement and a closing agreement with the I.R.S., it’s pretty hard for the Southern District to go back and get the firm — that bar makes it pretty hard,” argued a senior tax lawyer involved in the wider tax shelter investigation, referring to the federal Southern District of New York. Ernst & Young could still ultimately reach a deal that does not involve charges, but an acknowledgment of wrongdoing. KPMG reached a $456 million deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in 2005, as a condition of not being indicted — a near-certain corporate death sentence. Sixteen former KPMG employees, plus an outside lawyer and investment adviser, are set to stand trial at an undetermined date over their tax shelter work. Yesterday’s developments suggest that federal prosecutors are more likely to focus on individuals rather than firms in the tax shelter investigation. Robert Bennett, a lawyer for KPMG who persuaded the Justice Department not to indict the firm in 2005, said yesterday that “there’s a movement away from a knee-jerk reaction to impose vicarious liability on companies.” The indictment accuses the four Ernst & Young men of lying to the I.R.S. in the summer of 2002 during the audit of their employer that resulted in the $15 million penalty. “After being placed under oath, they sought to obstruct and impede the I.R.S. by providing false and misleading testimony concerning the origin, design, marketing and implementation of E.& Y.’s tax shelters,” the indictment said. In a statement yesterday, Ernst & Young said the four “were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago, that was responsible for developing the transactions in question. None of the individuals was part of the firm’s management. ” It added that “Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation. We have voluntarily made many changes and enhancements to our tax practice. We have also made other changes to our tax practice pursuant to our 2003 agreement with the I.R.S., which the I.R.S. commissioner called a model for agreements with practitioners.” POPULAR - BUSINESS Bumped Fliers and No Plan B Economix: Truth, Fiction and Lou Dobbs In India, Grandma Cooks, They Deliver Is Wal-Mart Too Cheap for Its Own Good?

Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor Unit of News Corp. Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Interactive Media, a unit of the , has agreed to acquire the photo-storage site Photobucket, just weeks after a public spat in which the popular networking site MySpace partly blocked content from Photobucket. MySpace, which is also owned by the News Corporation, lifted the block after about two weeks, but both sides have been silent on the details of their peacemaking. Separately, Fox also agreed to buy Flektor Inc., which offers Web-based tools for creating slide shows, recombined videos and other interactive presentations. Financial terms of the two deals were not disclosed. MySpace users often embed third-party photos, video and other material in their personal profile pages, and sites like Photobucket and YouTube, ’s video-sharing site, make that easy by providing the programming code to cut and paste into MySpace pages. The practice has made Photobucket one of the leading sites on the Internet, even though relatively few users access content directly through its home page. MySpace blocked Photobucket in April, after complaining that the hosting service had been encouraging users to incorporate an ad-supported slide show into their MySpace profiles. MySpace said the slide show violated its policies banning unauthorized commercial activity. Photobucket’s chief executive, Alex Welch, responded by accusing MySpace of limiting free expression and treating users as a commodity. He was more conciliatory two weeks later, saying the two had “established open lines of communication and procedures,” but he made no mention of negotiations over a sale of his company.

Yahoo said its co-founder, Jerry Yang, would assume Mr. Nazem’s responsibilities while it searches for a replacement. The departure of Mr. Nazem, 45, who is known as Zod, will follow a turbulent year at Yahoo that included a companywide revamping. Several other senior executives, including the chief operating officer, have left in the wake of the overhaul. Yahoo would not make Mr. Nazem or any other executive available to discuss his departure. But a spokeswoman, Joanna Stevens, said that Mr. Nazem had wanted to retire and that he and the chief executive, Terry S. Semel, had been planning his departure for some time. Writing in the company’s , Mr. Nazem said, “As I began contemplating retirement, there were a few milestones that I (along with the executive leadership team) wanted to accomplish prior to my departure.” Those milestones, he wrote, included the reorganization of the company and its technology group, as well as the introduction of an advertising platform, known as Project Panama, which Yahoo began introducing in February. “It was very important to me,” Mr. Nazem said, “to drive all the way to my last day here at Yahoo without distractions of an announcement like this.” The new advertising platform is aimed at narrowing the lead of in online advertising, but it has yet to translate into financial gains for the company. Mr. Nazem, who is responsible for the operation of the Yahoo Web site and for product development, was popular among the company’s technology ranks, whom he largely helped hire. This month, Yahoo appointed Blake Jorgensen, a founder of Thomas Weisel Partners, as chief financial officer, replacing Susan L. Decker, who is switching roles to become head of the company’s advertiser and publisher group. Yahoo is looking for an executive to lead its audience group, which is responsible for much of the main company Web site. After Mr. Nazem’s departure, Yahoo is likely to have vacant positions at the top of two of its three operating units. As part of his separation agreement, Mr. Nazem will receive a lump sum equal to his base salary for the rest of the year as well as accelerated vesting of stock options and stock awards, a package that an executive compensation firm, Equilar, estimated around $6.9 million.

Jazz Pharmaceuticals &#151; along with the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &#38; Company and some of Wall Street&#8217;s most prestigious investment banks &#151; is hoping investors think so. Jazz, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has filed to sell as much as $180 million in stock as early as today in its first public offering. Jazz&#8217;s main product is gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, a fast-acting with a history of use in date rape and serious risks of overdose, including coma and death. Jazz sells it under the brand name Xyrem to treat narcolepsy, a serious lists GHB as a Schedule I drug, the most dangerous kind, in the same category as heroin. But the Food and Drug Administration has approved Xyrem for narcolepsy, and when dispensed by prescription Xyrem can be used legally. Because of its risks, Xyrem can be distributed only under very strict rules. And the marketing of the drug by Jazz is the subject of a federal criminal case in Brooklyn that has already resulted in one felony guilty plea by a former Jazz employee. The narcolepsy market is small, estimated at only 120,000 patients, and sales of Xyrem were just $29 million in 2006. As for Jazz, it lost $82 million last year and has lost almost $200 million since it was founded in 2003. Auditors have warned that the losses raise &#8220;substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,&#8221; according to the offering prospectus Jazz filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In plain English, Jazz &#151; which had $67 million in cash as of March 31 &#151; is running out of money. And if it does not get more, it could go broke as early as the end of this year. Jazz is hoping to solve that problem, at least temporarily, by selling as much as 6.9 million shares to the public at $24 to $26 a share. The offering, which values Jazz at about $600 million, could be completed as early as this morning, with shares sold to institutional or individual buyers who can resell them when Jazz begins trading later in the day. (which is also an investor in Jazz) and are leading the deal. Aside from Jazz itself, the biggest winner in the public offering would be Kohlberg Kravis and other private equity firms. Since 2003, they have sunk $265 million into Jazz. If the company cannot go public, they will have to choose between putting more money up or potentially losing their entire investments. Matthew K. Fust, Jazz&#8217;s chief financial officer, declined to comment about the offering or Jazz. A spokeswoman for Kohlberg said the firm could not comment because the offering is imminent. Securities and Exchange Commission rules discourage companies from discussing their prospects in advance of a public offering. Jazz hopes to expand Xyrem&#8217;s potential market vastly by winning approval from the F.D.A. to promote it for fibromyalgia, a vague and poorly understood pain disorder with symptoms that are often treated with antidepressants. Jazz is conducting two late-stage clinical trials to prove that Xyrem reduces the pain of fibromyalgia, with results expected in the one trial in the second half of 2008. In an earlier trial, about 30 percent of the people who took Xyrem reported improvement in their fibromyalgia symptoms, compared with 13 percent on a placebo. Whether that figure will be enough to persuade the F.D.A. to approve Xyrem &#151; whose label warns that abuse of GHB can cause &#8220;seizure, respiratory depression and profound decreases in level of consciousness&#8221; &#151; is not clear. Much bigger drug companies, including , are also researching fibromyalgia treatments and have medicines further along in development. Jazz, meanwhile, is still under a cloud in a criminal case in Brooklyn involving the way it promoted Xyrem to doctors. Last year, federal prosecutors charged Dr. Peter Gleason, a psychiatrist, with working illegally with Jazz to encourage doctors to use Xyrem to treat fibromyalgia and other diseases for which Xyrem has not been approved, so-called off-label uses. The case has raised debate about free speech and how tightly the government may regulate discussions by doctors with one another. Under F.D.A. rules, doctors may prescribe drugs for any condition they see fit, but pharmaceutical companies are not allowed to promote drugs for off-label uses. Dr. Gleason is fighting the charges. But in March, David Tucker, a former sales manager for Jazz who worked with Dr. Gleason, pleaded guilty to a single felony count of introducing a misbranded drug into interstate commerce. Mr. Tucker has not been sentenced, but the charge carries a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison, according to Bruce Maloy, Mr. Tucker&#8217;s lawyer. Geoffrey Kaiser, the prosecutor handling the case, said he could not comment. In its prospectus, Jazz says it is close to settling the case by pleading guilty to the same felony charge as Mr. Tucker and paying $20.5 million in civil and criminal fines and restitution. With all the clouds over Xyrem, potential investors in Jazz may be pleased to know that it does sell another drug, Antizol, used to treat people who have been poisoned by antifreeze. Unfortunately &#151; or fortunately, perhaps &#151; Antizol&#8217;s market is even smaller than Xyrem&#8217;s.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/technology/31google.html Moving Web-Based Software Offline Web-Based Software Offline FRANCISCO, May 30 — Millions of people enjoy free Web-based software programs that deliver e-mail, news and many other services. But those programs are available to users only when they are online. Skip to next paragraph Google&#146;s chief executive, Eric Schmidt, speaking at the Seoul Digital Forum Wednesday. He said Google wanted to expand in South Korea. is hoping to help make many of those programs, among them its own free Web applications like Gmail and Docs and Spreadsheets, available offline, say when a user is on an airplane. In doing so, Google will more openly challenge and its office productivity tools, like Excel and Word, which users must buy for hundreds of dollars. That rivalry was heightened Wednesday when Google released a set of tools to software programmers, which it calls Google Gears, that addresses what is perhaps the single most critical shortcoming of Web-based software. The tools can be used by all programmers, whether they work for Google or not, to enhance their own Web-based programs for offline use. The company is making the technology available in an open-source model, so programmers can use it free, test its abilities and extend them as necessary to fit their needs. “The whole idea of extending browser capabilities to offline is something that a lot of people are going to get pretty excited about,” said David Mitchell Smith, a vice president at Gartner Research. Google is introducing Gears during a coming-out party of sorts. The company is playing host to what it calls its first “developer day,” an event held around the world at which Google will present itself not as the world’s most-used search engine, or as the biggest Internet advertising company, or even as the creator of applications like Gmail, but rather as the provider of tools that others can use to build their own programs. It is an event that underscores Google’s evolution from its roots as a search engine into a company that hopes to become central to a new way of computing in which software is delivered over the Web, often free and supported by ads, rather than bought and installed on users’ PCs. This evolution sharpens Google’s rivalry with Microsoft and others who are trying to provide both new Web-based software and technology building blocks for Web programmers. Google has been among the most enthusiastic proponents of this new computing model, and its executives say it will help usher in faster innovation because many Web applications can be created quickly by cobbling together existing components created by others. “It is a different model,” Google’s chief executive, Eric Schmidt, said in an interview. “The rate at which you can build applications is an order of magnitude faster because the components all fit together so quickly.” Google hopes other companies will use Gears to extend their own software and services. Some Microsoft rivals, including and Mozilla, which is behind the Firefox Web browser, are collaborating with Google on the technology. But it could also help Google’s rivals. If the Gears technology proves effective, scores of software programs, including Mail and Microsoft’s Hotmail, might one day be used offline to read e-mail messages and to compose new ones. The new e-mail messages would be sent the next time a user connects to the Internet. Google said Gears was in early stages of development. “This is not a solution that is going to work with everything on Day 1,” Mr. Smith said. For now, Google itself has applied Gears only to one of its own programs, Reader, which is used to track blogs and news sources. But the company plans to use Gears to make other programs like Gmail, Calendar, and most notably, Docs and Spreadsheets, available offline. That would make those programs more competitive with Microsoft’s Office suite of programs, one of the software giant’s cash cows. Google has begun marketing a package of these productivity applications to businesses. But many analysts say these products, unlike Microsoft’s competing software, lack the support or functions that most businesses need. “I don’t think Google is a serious player in personal productivity applications, certainly not for businesses,” said David Card, an analyst with Jupiter Research. This is not the first time that Google has offered tools to developers. Indeed, the company, much like many of its competitors in recent years, has long opened up many of its own programs to others, in hopes they would use them as building blocks for their own software and services. For instance, when Google allowed others to build map-based software and services on top of its Google Maps product, an explosion of creativity ensued. Online travel and real estate companies used the maps to enhance their own Web sites or to create entirely new businesses. And even individual programmers used data from multiple sources to “mash up” new applications. Some of these companies and Web sites, in turn, are supported by advertising that is sold by Google. Microsoft and Yahoo have opened up their own map products to developers with similar results. In putting on its first developer day, Google hopes to lure even more programmers into its camp at a time when many Internet companies are competing for their skills by offering them new tools aimed at making Web programs more capable or easy to assemble. Microsoft, for instance, recently released a product called Silverlight, which allows programmers to deliver high-quality video and other features to Web applications. “We see an emerging market that combines what people love about the Web with richness and interactivity of full desktop application,” said Brian Goldfarb, senior product manager for Silverlight.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31deal.html Ceridian to Be Taken Private in $5.3 Billion Deal to Be Taken Private in $5.3 Billion Deal a human resources company, said last night that it had sold itself to the private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners and the specialty insurer for $5.3 billion in cash. The deal values Ceridian at $36 a share, a 5.3 percent premium to its closing price of $34.19 yesterday. In after-hours trading, Ceridian rose $1.41, or 4 percent, to $35.60. Ceridian and its buyers noted, however, that Ceridian was trading at around $31 before Feb. 17, when the company announced that it was putting itself up for sale. The deal represents a 16 percent premium over that price, and a 56 percent premium to Ceridian&#8217;s price on Oct. 6, the day before Ceridian announced Kathryn V. Marinello&#8217;s appointment as chief executive. Last year, Ceridian reported earnings of $174 million, or $1.20 a share, so the merger values the company at 30 times its trailing earnings, compared with about 18 times earnings for the average company in the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500-stock index. Ceridian&#8217;s human resource division offers payroll, tax and benefits services to 110,000 companies, with a combined 25 million employees, in 38 countries. The company also processes payments and issues credit and stored-value cards for the trucking and retail industries. In a statement announcing the deal, Thomas H. Lee and Fidelity said they planned to bring other investors into the transaction. Fidelity will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian at closing and for accounting purposes will not consolidate Ceridian&#8217;s results into its income statement. The transaction will be presented to Ceridian shareholders for approval at the company&#8217;s annual meeting, after the filing of proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Ceridian said it would hold its annual meeting no later than Sept. 21.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/technology/31digital.html For Jobs and Gates, a Night to Reminisce Jobs and Gates, a Night to Reminisce Bill Gates and Steven P. Jobs in a rare joint appearance at a technology conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Calif., May 30 — In a highly anticipated encounter, Bill Gates of Microsoft and Steven P. Jobs of Apple took the stage Wednesday evening to relive old battles and alliances and speculate about the future of digital culture and technology. Rivals for three decades, the two executives have rarely appeared in public together and have generally been viewed as bitter rivals, despite occasional partnerships. In front of about 600 technology executives at the D: All Things Digital conference, which was sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, the two executives attracted the attention usually reserved for rock singers and Hollywood stars. However, attendees who came hoping for fireworks or a confrontation were disappointed. The mild tone to the session did not take anything away from the event and after discussing the past and present of the computing industry, the two were greeted with a standing ovation. After the event was over a number of the attendees who are veterans of decades in the computer industry said the joint appearance was the most memorable moment of any of the many conferences they had attended. Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs largely pioneered the personal computer industry beginning in 1975 and 1976 and they spent part of the evening sharing memories of those days. Today "we ship these computers with one or two gigabytes and nobody remembers 128 kilobytes," Mr. Jobs said. Apple and Microsoft were business partners at the start of the computer era beginning in 1977 when Mr. Gates supplied a copy of the BASIC programming language for the Apple II computer. Later, Mr. Gates made an early bet on writing software for the Macintosh, two years before the computer was introduced in 1984. Neither was willing to acknowledge the possibility that the personal computer era they helped create would end any time soon. "The PC has proven to be very resilient," Mr. Jobs said. At the same time they called themselves believers in the explosion of hand-held communications devices, also known as "Post PC devices." Mr. Gates said he was sometimes frustrated by the fact that the players in the industry changed so quickly. "I miss it when people come and go. It's nice when people stick around and it gives us some context," he said.During a question and answer period at the end of the session both men were asked to comment on the other's strengths. Mr. Gates singled out Mr. Jobs intuitive aesthetic sense. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste," Mr. Gates said, drawing laughter from the audience. "The way he does things, it's just different." Mr. Jobs returned the compliment, noting that Mr. Gates skills at building business partnerships were something that eluded him in his first decade at Apple. Asked to comment on today's computer industry and the youth culture that it markets to, both men pointed to examples of applications of computer technology that had been readily adopted by seniors. Mr. Gates said that when he showed the Microsoft Surface, the touch computing system introduced on Wednesday to a group of chief executives at his home several weeks ago, he was surprised they were more enthusiastic about the product than he was. The executives, he noted came from a generation that was not comfortable with keyboards. They were particularly interested in a technology that allowed them to control things on a display screen by pointing and moving them directly with their fingers. Neither man was willing to say harsh things about the other and Mr. Jobs summed up his feelings by quoting from a Beatles song: "&#61486;'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,' that's clearly true here," he said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31plavix.html Bristol-Myers to Pay Fine to Pay Fine May 30 (Agence France-Presse) — has agreed to plead guilty and pay a $1 million criminal fine for lying to the government about a patent deal on its blood-thinning drug Plavix, officials said Wednesday. The Justice Department said in a statement that the company’s actions had threatened to reduce competition for the drug, one of the best-selling prescription medications worldwide. Government investigators said that a former senior executive had made “oral representations” to a Canadian generic drug maker, Apotex, that caused Apotex to conclude that Bristol-Myers would not introduce its own generic version of Plavix. At the time, the two companies were locked in litigation over the validity of the patent for Plavix. Bristol-Myers, however, was subject to a consent decree that required it to submit any patent settlements for review with the Federal Trade Commission. The government said that Bristol-Myers had also lied to the government about the arrangement. The government inquiry is still open. The patent deal’s failure led to the ouster of Bristol-Myers’s chief executive, Peter R. Dolan, in September.

First developed in the 1940s by George Gallup, the father of modern polling, random sampling requires hours of costly legwork by an army of specially trained pollsters. But some survey companies that offer an Internet-based alternative to traditional polls are trying to make inroads, including a British one, YouGov, which plans to introduce its methods in the United States for the next presidential election. Working with a large panel of respondents who answer a range of questions through an online questionnaire, YouGov says it can predict election outcomes and consumer preferences with greater accuracy for far less money than ever before. To reflect a broad spectrum of opinion, the online panelists are recruited from all walks of life, and efforts are made to reach out to people who are less likely to be online, like the elderly and people with low incomes. Panelists are paid to participate — which is a big no-no in conventional polling — and their identities are validated by their home addresses and other personal details. To be sure, traditional pollsters and political consultants do not view online surveys as scientifically acceptable. The sampling of consumer opinion tapped through an online questionnaire cannot be as random as traditional measures, they argue, and it is easier for people to misrepresent themselves and their opinions online. Another critical difference is that in traditional polls, participation is voluntary, not paid. “Voter polling by the Internet is not yet viable,” said Joel Benenson, a Democratic pollster working for the presidential campaign of Senator of Illinois. “There are some uses for online polling, but it still misses out on too much of the population for us.” Despite the strong skepticism, Internet-based survey results are likely to get some publicity during the 2008 elections, and executives from companies that conduct these surveys hope that they can use the attention to gain credibility for their methods. YouGov, for example, has formed a partnership with Polimetrix, an online survey company based in Palo Alto, Calif., for surveys in the United States. Polimetrix, with a panel of one million people, plans to track the 2008 presidential election with a 50-state survey covering a minimum of 1,000 panelists in each state. “State-by-state election results are an important way for us to prove that our methodology delivers accurate results,” said Douglas Rivers, a political science professor who founded Polimetrix in 2004. “You can be lucky once, but not 50 times.” Professor Rivers said that the margin of error for Polimetrix surveys is similar to that of polls conducted by telephone. YouGov said that its own results in recent British elections were as close or closer to the actual votes than traditional polling methods. Mr. Benenson of the Obama campaign said that the Internet can be an effective way to test ad campaigns for specific populations, but that the variables are too great for judging the views of the general population. Polls on which public policy decisions are based still require walking the streets, said Leendert de Voogd, managing director of TNS Opinion in Brussels, one of the world’s largest polling companies. “It is still way too early for public opinion polling to go online,” Mr. de Voogd said. “Internet polling is like the Far West, with no rules, no sheriff and no reference points.” Among the surveys run by TNS Opinion is Eurobarometer, a survey of public opinion across Europe conducted for the “The decisions made on the basis of our polls are far too important to be left to an online survey,” Mr. de Voogd said. “Online polls can miss very important parts of the population.” For YouGov, developing a balanced panel of regular respondents from all sectors of the population is a priority, said Nadhim Zahawi, YouGov’s chief executive. “We expend a lot of effort reaching older people and other demographics” of people who are less likely to use the Internet, he said. Mr. Zahawi added that modern technology has made old-fashioned polls more cumbersome and unreliable. “Thanks to the increased use of mobile phones, the traditional pollsters face a growing problem of how to track down people at home,” he said. In London, The Daily Telegraph, which uses YouGov’s services roughly twice a month, appreciates the ability to query a large number of people in a short time.

The 2.5-pound &#8220;appliance&#8221; comes with a 10-inch screen and is meant to be a companion for a smartphone, according to one of Palm&#8217;s founders, Jeff Hawkins, who introduced the machine here at the D: All Things Digital technology industry conference. The Foleo, which will be priced starting at $499, synchronizes information with Palm and Windows Mobile phones and can be linked wirelessly via phones to the Internet, although it comes with During a demonstration, Mr. Hawkins acknowledged the limitations of smartphones, which have been viewed as a lighter, less expensive alternative to carrying a portable laptop computer. &#8220;Sometimes you need a big screen,&#8221; Mr. Hawkins said. He said he had struck on the idea of a mobile companion for the phone five years ago, but that his business partners Donna Dubinsky and Ed Colligan had resisted the project as a distraction while the company introduced the popular The Foleo, which will go on sale this summer, is based on the Linux operating system. But it does not have a broad range of applications. For example, while Mr. Hawkins demonstrated the ability to synchronize e-mail automatically with a smartphone, synchronizing with a datebook was not a feature. The notion of an inch-thick device that is sold as a peripheral to a phone generated some skepticism. But several analysts saidt the phone might get a following of Linux enthusiasts. &#8220;This could become the first commercially viable portable Linux system,&#8221; said Tim Bajarin, an industry analyst at Creative Strategies, a consulting firm based in Campbell, Calif. The Foleo is the latest in a series of industry efforts to define a new category between cellphones and laptops. has tried to create interest in devices it calls ultra-mobile PCs, and has been encouraging developers to introduce systems it describes as mobile Internet devices.

CBS, one of the nation’s biggest radio broadcasters, said the founders of the five-year-old service would continue to operate it as an independent unit. But the purchase is also regarded as a way for CBS to grab an audience online at a time when many traditional radio stations fear losing listeners to iPods, Internet radio and other competing media. The sale of Last.FM comes as the profitability of online radio has been called into question. A recent ruling by the federal Copyright Royalty Board, which establishes royalty rates for Internet-based broadcasters that stream music online, would raise the existing rates significantly. CBS said the deal provided an opportunity to extend its reach online, including adding some of its own programming to Last.FM. As it stands, the site attracts more than 15 million users worldwide, with big audiences in the United States, Britain and Germany.

With the latest round of cuts, the company has announced plans to eliminate more than 10 percent of its work force since the start of 2007, when it became clear that two years of strong momentum behind the popular Razr mobile phone had collapsed. The company&#8217;s travails caused it to be the target of a proxy fight this year by the billionaire investor , who lost his bid this month for a board seat. Motorola said Wednesday that Mr. Icahn had received 717.1 million votes, compared with 931.7 million for John A. White, the company nominee he was closest to defeating. All other Motorola nominees got at least 1.6 billion votes. The company had been in the process of eliminating 3,500 jobs as part of a two-year cost-cutting plan to save $400 million. Motorola said the newly announced cuts, together with other cost-control measures, would save another $600 million in 2008. Motorola&#8217;s work force, which stood at 150,000 worldwide as recently as 2000, had declined to 66,000 at the beginning of the year. Wall Street gave modest approval to the latest cuts.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/30/technology/31pogue.html The Cartridge, Updated, Catches Up to Data of the Art The Cartridge, Updated, Catches Up to Data 2007 If you’ve ever felt as though you can’t keep up with the pace of life, well, it could have been worse. You could have been a computer disk. Skip to next paragraph Backing Up Your Files The current Iomega Rev drive takes 70-gigabyte cartridges and also accepts the 35-gigabyte cartridges of the original 2004 model. The Dell PowerVault RD 1000 and an 80-gigabyte cartridge, above. The cartridge contains a complete shock-mounted hard drive. The history of removable disks is one sad “couldn’t keep up” story after another. Remember the floppy disk (800 kilobytes)? The SyQuest cartridge (44 megabytes)? The Zip disk (100 megabytes)? The Jaz disk (1 gigabyte)? The recordable DVD (4.7 gigabytes)? Each one seemed at first like a handy system for making backups and transporting files. But as computer hard drives grew, those removable disks wound up looking pathetically puny. Nowadays, it’s not unusual for a new computer to come with a 320-gigabyte hard drive. Are you really going to back it up onto 68 blank DVDs? Or 444,431 floppies? It’s been years since there was a cartridge system on every desk. But like the hip-huggers, side ponytails and other fads of the 1980s, removables are making a comeback. At least three companies — , Quantum and ProStor —now offer cartridge systems that are just as convenient and transportable as Zip disks once were, but big enough to back up a hard drive. That’s because the cartridges actually Your initial outlay is for the drive itself. Each company makes both an internal model, which is installed inside a computer, and an external one that sits on the desk and connects with a U.S.B. cable. The price is fairly high; for example, the external Rev drive from Iomega costs about $500, the external GoVault from Quantum will cost around $370 when it hits stores in July, and an external RDX drive is on special from Dell for $300. Each drive includes one starter cartridge. (ProStor doesn’t actually sell its RDX systems. Instead, it created the design for RDX drives, which are manufactured and sold interchangeably by companies like Dell, , Tandberg and Exabyte under their own names. The Dell model I tested is called the PowerVault RD 1000.) The drive itself is just a dock with electronics and power circuitry. Into this shell, you slide the interchangeable cartridges that contain your data. All three drives leave one cartridge edge exposed — the edge with the label, so you can see which cartridge is currently inserted. The edge of an RDX cartridge (not just the drive) also bears a status light, which makes life much easier if troubleshooting is ever required. Once inserted, the cartridge behaves exactly like a hard drive. You can add and remove files by dragging and dropping, or by using an automated backup program. Backup software is included with all three drives. Quantum’s superb backup program, for example, crams more onto your cartridges using “de-duplication” — storing only new sections of documents you’ve already backed up. The drives are silent and fast. On a Windows PC, copying a 1.5-gigabyte folder full of large and small files took 80 seconds on the Quantum, and 90 seconds on the Rev and RDX drives. The Quantum GoVault and RDX cartridges both come in several sizes, ranging from 40 to 160 gigabytes. It’s very cool how a single drive can accommodate cartridges of all different capacities, present and future. Iomega, on the other hand, intends to keep releasing new drives to accommodate larger-capacity cartridges. The current drive takes 70-gigabyte cartridges. It also accepts the 35-gig cartridges of its original 2004 Rev drive, but “plays” them much slower. The Quantum and RDX cartridges (both 4.5 by 3.5 by 1 inch) are incredibly rugged. They’re intended to be handled, tossed, shipped and even dropped. They can shrug off one-meter drops onto concrete — a claim my kids and I had a glorious time investigating. The RDX cartridges even have what the company calls a static-dissipation system. The tiny Rev cartridges (3 by 3 by 0.4 inch) are built differently. Whereas each Quantum and RDX cartridge is a complete, sealed, shock-mounted 2.5-inch hard drive, the Rev cartridge contains only the spinning platter and the motor; the delicate stuff, like the read-write heads (the “needle” that plays the disk) are in the drive. As a result, Rev cartridges are slightly less tough; they can handle only three-foot drops onto “industrial carpet.” Still, anyone who nervously recalls the “click of death” that occasionally haunted Iomega’s previous systems, like Zip and Jaz, should be reassured; Rev drives have been on the market since 2004 (Iomega says that it has sold over a million cartridges), and even a search fails to reveal any Jaz-like community of bereaved customers with failed cartridges. Rev is also the only product that works on both Mac and Windows, and the only one available in both U.S.B.-connector and FireWire-connector editions. These cartridge systems sound great, right? Fast, tough, capacious — what more could you ask? You’ll pay $100 for Quantum’s 40-gigabyte cartridge and $305 for a 160-gig cartridge. The RDX cartridges are priced similarly, ranging from $118 (40 gigabytes) to $270 (160 gigs). Sorry, but that’s just nuts. For a fraction of that price, you could just buy a big old hard drive. These days, a 250-gigabyte internal drive costs about $66, for heaven’s sake. Of course, the beauty of the cartridges is that they’re transportable. A proper backup system involves storing a copy of your data off site, not in your office. So a more apt comparison would be with those little pocket hard drives — external U.S.B. drives like Seagate’s FreeAgent Go or ’s Pocket Media drive. But these, too, cost less than cartridges. A 120-gigabyte pocket hard drive costs about $85 — about one-third the price of the same-size Quantum cartridge. Iomega Rev cartridges are much more reasonably priced: $270 for a five-pack, which comes to about $54 each. They’re the only reasonable option for people whose last name isn’t “Inc.” Even so, that’s 77 cents per gigabyte, compared with 71 cents for a self-contained pocket hard drive. (You don’t even want to know the Quantum and RDX cost per gigabyte. All right, maybe you do: $2.03 and $1.70, respectively. And I’m not even counting the price of the drive itself.) So what, exactly, is the value proposition here? All three companies emphatically stress that their products are not intended for everyday desktop storage. Instead, these systems are supposed to be highly reliable backup machines for businesses. They are primarily intended to replace tape backup drives, which thousands of small businesses use to back up their computers. Sure enough, compared with these cartridges, tape backup systems are unreliable, high maintenance and even more expensive. You don’t have random instant access to files — the tape literally has to rewind or fast-forward to find a certain file — and tracking and managing the tapes themselves are a headache. Well, fine. If that’s the cartridge companies’ narrowly defined mission — replacing tape backup systems for businesses — then congratulations to them; they’ve succeeded. But the technology in these systems, including their speed, convenience, silence, compactness and reliability, is terrific. If it weren’t for the nosebleed pricing, cartridge systems would find a huge and happy home among everyday computer users. Think of all the photographers, music buffs and video editors who would love to hot-swap 160-gigabyte cartridges on the fly, ready to toss in the briefcase or cram into a envelope. Think of how great it would be to create a snapshot of your entire hard drive every few days, creating a rotating cartridge system that would mean you’re always backed up and safe. Imagine a return to the heady days when cartridges were so popular and prevalent, you could stuff a Zip disk in your coat pocket, confident that you’d be able to use it at your buddy’s house.

Under current law, a work is automatically copyrighted the moment it is “fixed in tangible form.” And these days, that copyright lasts virtually forever: 70 years after the death of the author, in most cases. Since there is no requirement to register a work and a copyright lasts so long, the legal owner of a work can be difficult to find, particularly when the work is more than a few decades old. When some librarians at tried to request permissions to digitize a collection of out-of-print books, they were unable to find more than 20 percent of the rights holders, despite persistent efforts. Failing to locate rights holders can be costly since copyright infringement may be subject to statutory damages of up to $150,000 an incident. The costs of locating rights holders are an example of what economists call transactions costs. Not surprisingly, high transactions costs tend to discourage transactions from occurring. The so-called orphan works problem was examined by the Copyright Office in a 2006 report in which it proposed legislation to address the transactions costs issues. Under its proposal, if you conducted a “diligent search” to locate a rights holder and still failed to find the owner, you would be off the hook. You could then incorporate the work in question into your own work, as long as you provided proper attribution. If the legitimate rights holder was subsequently found, he or she could not require that your work be withdrawn from circulation, but could collect “reasonable compensation” for use. But what is a “diligent search?” The report leaves the interpretation of this phrase up to the courts but suggests some relevant considerations: whether the work includes identification, the age of the work, whether the work can be found in public databases like Copyright Office records, and so on. The Copyright Office’s proposal is certainly a step in the right direction. Clarifying the rights and obligations of the buyers and sellers of copyrighted material would reduce transactions costs, and that should lead to a more efficient market for intellectual property. But does the proposed legislation go far enough? According to Law professor who is an expert in copyright law, it does not. He favors a system where authors receive an automatic copyright when they create new works, but they must register their copyright within 14 years to retain it past the initial period. (Unfortunately, such a registration requirement cannot apply to foreign creators because of international copyright treaties.) This is in the same spirit as the copyright law in place before 1964 requiring that copyrights be renewed at the Copyright Office in their 28th year. Materials that weren’t renewed fell into the public domain. Mr. Lessig envisions the Copyright Office as specifying the standards for registries but not necessarily operating them, since the private sector may be better positioned to build and maintain such systems. His inspiration is the domain name system used to register Internet sites. In that system, a standards body specifies the design, but it is up to individual organizations to carry out the necessary registries. The proposals by the Copyright Office and Mr. Lessig are not necessarily exclusive. If easily accessible copyright registries existed, the courts would probably find that simply searching the registries would satisfy the diligent search requirement. Creators of works with commercial potential would then have strong incentives to register their works. In such a world, a legal requirement to register works could be redundant, since the commercial incentives to register would be strong. Still, why take a chance? Establishing the expectations that works should be registered to receive the full protection of copyright law makes a lot of sense. Creating a registry is not that difficult from either a technological or a business perspective. The Copyright Clearance Center ( ) was established by a group of publishers in 1978 to provide rights clearance for printed works. The Harry Fox Agency ( ) serves as a clearinghouse for those who want to make recordings of songs, and there are plenty of Web sites devoted to image search to ease the sharing of photographs. But would the creators charge excessive fees if rights clearinghouses became widespread? I would argue that just the opposite would occur. An easy-to-use, efficient and competitive marketplace tends to push prices down. Reducing the transactions costs of acquiring reproduction rights potentially makes both creators and users of information better off. The orphan works legislation from the Copyright Office is still on the back burner in Congress. Let us hope that it soon gets the attention it deserves. Information plays a crucial role in today’s economy. Making it easy for creators and users of information to find each other should be a high priority for policy makers. Hal R.

Judge Elaine E. Bucklo of Federal District Court in Chicago said the plaintiffs’ complaint did not give enough detail about a supposed scheme by the company to conceal the existence of gluten and dairy in its food products. Judge Bucklo allowed two claims on breach of warranty and unjust enrichment to proceed. The suit had sought to force the company to change food product information in its advertising. Lawyers for McDonald’s, which is based in Oak Brook, Ill., asked the court to throw out the lawsuit in November, referring to the plaintiffs as a few “hypersensitive consumers with allergies.” The complaint was filed by 11 people who accused McDonald’s of concealing allergens until it was forced to disclose them by a change in food-labeling laws.

The acquisition will allow Cantor to consolidate its interdealer broker businesses and end all revenue-sharing agreements with eSpeed, which some eSpeed investors had criticized. But Cantor is retaining voting control over the new company, which will be called BGC Partners and trade on the . BGC had made a $460 million initial public offering proposal earlier this year, which it will now withdraw. ESpeed, used to trade primarily United States Treasuries, will issue 133,860,000 shares of its common stock and rights to acquire shares of BGC’s common stock. BGC, which had first-quarter revenue of $249 million, is valued at approximately $1.23 billion, based on the closing price of eSpeed’s stock Tuesday. Shares of eSpeed rose 4 cents, to $9.23. The deal will do little to make BCG and eSpeed more competitive against the market leaders, Icap and Tullett, said Octavio Marenzi, chief executive of consulting firm Celent, noting that the move is more about simplifying the “bizarre, triangular” relationship among Cantor, BGC and eSpeed. He added that if Cantor has voting control, it makes the deal less attractive to investors. The combined company’s 2007 projected revenue is expected to be approximately $1 billion. For 2008, the combined company’s projected revenue is expected to increase by more than 12 percent to over $1.1 billion, the companies said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/technology/31google.html?ex=1338264000&en=f23b06a99925cd70&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss Moving Web-Based Software Offline Web-Based Software Offline FRANCISCO, May 30 — Millions of people enjoy free Web-based software programs that deliver e-mail, news and many other services. But those programs are available to users only when they are online. Skip to next paragraph Google&#146;s chief executive, Eric Schmidt, speaking at the Seoul Digital Forum Wednesday. He said Google wanted to expand in South Korea. is hoping to help make many of those programs, among them its own free Web applications like Gmail and Docs and Spreadsheets, available offline, say when a user is on an airplane. In doing so, Google will more openly challenge and its office productivity tools, like Excel and Word, which users must buy for hundreds of dollars. That rivalry was heightened Wednesday when Google released a set of tools to software programmers, which it calls Google Gears, that addresses what is perhaps the single most critical shortcoming of Web-based software. The tools can be used by all programmers, whether they work for Google or not, to enhance their own Web-based programs for offline use. The company is making the technology available in an open-source model, so programmers can use it free, test its abilities and extend them as necessary to fit their needs. “The whole idea of extending browser capabilities to offline is something that a lot of people are going to get pretty excited about,” said David Mitchell Smith, a vice president at Gartner Research. Google is introducing Gears during a coming-out party of sorts. The company is playing host to what it calls its first “developer day,” an event held around the world at which Google will present itself not as the world’s most-used search engine, or as the biggest Internet advertising company, or even as the creator of applications like Gmail, but rather as the provider of tools that others can use to build their own programs. It is an event that underscores Google’s evolution from its roots as a search engine into a company that hopes to become central to a new way of computing in which software is delivered over the Web, often free and supported by ads, rather than bought and installed on users’ PCs. This evolution sharpens Google’s rivalry with Microsoft and others who are trying to provide both new Web-based software and technology building blocks for Web programmers. Google has been among the most enthusiastic proponents of this new computing model, and its executives say it will help usher in faster innovation because many Web applications can be created quickly by cobbling together existing components created by others. “It is a different model,” Google’s chief executive, Eric Schmidt, said in an interview. “The rate at which you can build applications is an order of magnitude faster because the components all fit together so quickly.” Google hopes other companies will use Gears to extend their own software and services. Some Microsoft rivals, including and Mozilla, which is behind the Firefox Web browser, are collaborating with Google on the technology. But it could also help Google’s rivals. If the Gears technology proves effective, scores of software programs, including Mail and Microsoft’s Hotmail, might one day be used offline to read e-mail messages and to compose new ones. The new e-mail messages would be sent the next time a user connects to the Internet. Google said Gears was in early stages of development. “This is not a solution that is going to work with everything on Day 1,” Mr. Smith said. For now, Google itself has applied Gears only to one of its own programs, Reader, which is used to track blogs and news sources. But the company plans to use Gears to make other programs like Gmail, Calendar, and most notably, Docs and Spreadsheets, available offline. That would make those programs more competitive with Microsoft’s Office suite of programs, one of the software giant’s cash cows. Google has begun marketing a package of these productivity applications to businesses. But many analysts say these products, unlike Microsoft’s competing software, lack the support or functions that most businesses need. “I don’t think Google is a serious player in personal productivity applications, certainly not for businesses,” said David Card, an analyst with Jupiter Research. This is not the first time that Google has offered tools to developers. Indeed, the company, much like many of its competitors in recent years, has long opened up many of its own programs to others, in hopes they would use them as building blocks for their own software and services. For instance, when Google allowed others to build map-based software and services on top of its Google Maps product, an explosion of creativity ensued. Online travel and real estate companies used the maps to enhance their own Web sites or to create entirely new businesses. And even individual programmers used data from multiple sources to “mash up” new applications. Some of these companies and Web sites, in turn, are supported by advertising that is sold by Google. Microsoft and Yahoo have opened up their own map products to developers with similar results. In putting on its first developer day, Google hopes to lure even more programmers into its camp at a time when many Internet companies are competing for their skills by offering them new tools aimed at making Web programs more capable or easy to assemble. Microsoft, for instance, recently released a product called Silverlight, which allows programmers to deliver high-quality video and other features to Web applications. “We see an emerging market that combines what people love about the Web with richness and interactivity of full desktop application,” said Brian Goldfarb, senior product manager for Silverlight.

Lee Partners and the specialty insurer for $5.3 billion in cash. The deal values Ceridian at $36 a share, a 5.3 percent premium to its closing price of $34.19 yesterday. In after-hours trading, Ceridian rose $1.41, or 4 percent, to $35.60. Ceridian and its buyers noted, however, that Ceridian was trading at around $31 before Feb. 17, when the company announced that it was putting itself up for sale. The deal represents a 16 percent premium over that price, and a 56 percent premium to Ceridian&#8217;s price on Oct. 6, the day before Ceridian announced Kathryn V. Marinello&#8217;s appointment as chief executive. Last year, Ceridian reported earnings of $174 million, or $1.20 a share, so the merger values the company at 30 times its trailing earnings, compared with about 18 times earnings for the average company in the Standard &#38; Poor&#8217;s 500-stock index. Ceridian&#8217;s human resource division offers payroll, tax and benefits services to 110,000 companies, with a combined 25 million employees, in 38 countries. The company also processes payments and issues credit and stored-value cards for the trucking and retail industries. In a statement announcing the deal, Thomas H. Lee and Fidelity said they planned to bring other investors into the transaction. Fidelity will own less than 50 percent of Ceridian at closing and for accounting purposes will not consolidate Ceridian&#8217;s results into its income statement. The transaction will be presented to Ceridian shareholders for approval at the company&#8217;s annual meeting, after the filing of proxy materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Louis Gallois, chief executive of Airbus, said it was one of Airbus’s biggest orders ever. The Qatar Airways agreement for 20 A350-800s, 40 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s, as with most large orders, would probably come with deep discounts from the listing price. The agreement replaces one for 60 A350s signed in 2005. The commitment for 20 extra planes brings Airbus’s total orders for the A350 to 268.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31place.html Manufacturer of Risky Drug to Sell Shares of Risky Drug to Sell Shares a pharmaceutical company whose biggest-selling drug is considered as dangerous as heroin or LSD a good investment? Jazz Pharmaceuticals &#151; along with the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &#38; Company and some of Wall Street&#8217;s most prestigious investment banks &#151; is hoping investors think so. Jazz, based in Palo Alto, Calif., has filed to sell as much as $180 million in stock as early as today in its first public offering. Jazz&#8217;s main product is gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB, a fast-acting with a history of use in date rape and serious risks of overdose, including coma and death. Jazz sells it under the brand name Xyrem to treat narcolepsy, a serious lists GHB as a Schedule I drug, the most dangerous kind, in the same category as heroin. But the Food and Drug Administration has approved Xyrem for narcolepsy, and when dispensed by prescription Xyrem can be used legally. Because of its risks, Xyrem can be distributed only under very strict rules. And the marketing of the drug by Jazz is the subject of a federal criminal case in Brooklyn that has already resulted in one felony guilty plea by a former Jazz employee. The narcolepsy market is small, estimated at only 120,000 patients, and sales of Xyrem were just $29 million in 2006. As for Jazz, it lost $82 million last year and has lost almost $200 million since it was founded in 2003. Auditors have warned that the losses raise &#8220;substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern,&#8221; according to the offering prospectus Jazz filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In plain English, Jazz &#151; which had $67 million in cash as of March 31 &#151; is running out of money. And if it does not get more, it could go broke as early as the end of this year. Jazz is hoping to solve that problem, at least temporarily, by selling as much as 6.9 million shares to the public at $24 to $26 a share. The offering, which values Jazz at about $600 million, could be completed as early as this morning, with shares sold to institutional or individual buyers who can resell them when Jazz begins trading later in the day. (which is also an investor in Jazz) and are leading the deal. Aside from Jazz itself, the biggest winner in the public offering would be Kohlberg Kravis and other private equity firms. Since 2003, they have sunk $265 million into Jazz. If the company cannot go public, they will have to choose between putting more money up or potentially losing their entire investments. Matthew K. Fust, Jazz&#8217;s chief financial officer, declined to comment about the offering or Jazz. A spokeswoman for Kohlberg said the firm could not comment because the offering is imminent. Securities and Exchange Commission rules discourage companies from discussing their prospects in advance of a public offering. Jazz hopes to expand Xyrem&#8217;s potential market vastly by winning approval from the F.D.A. to promote it for fibromyalgia, a vague and poorly understood pain disorder with symptoms that are often treated with antidepressants. Jazz is conducting two late-stage clinical trials to prove that Xyrem reduces the pain of fibromyalgia, with results expected in the one trial in the second half of 2008. In an earlier trial, about 30 percent of the people who took Xyrem reported improvement in their fibromyalgia symptoms, compared with 13 percent on a placebo. Whether that figure will be enough to persuade the F.D.A. to approve Xyrem &#151; whose label warns that abuse of GHB can cause &#8220;seizure, respiratory depression and profound decreases in level of consciousness&#8221; &#151; is not clear. Much bigger drug companies, including , are also researching fibromyalgia treatments and have medicines further along in development. Jazz, meanwhile, is still under a cloud in a criminal case in Brooklyn involving the way it promoted Xyrem to doctors. Last year, federal prosecutors charged Dr. Peter Gleason, a psychiatrist, with working illegally with Jazz to encourage doctors to use Xyrem to treat fibromyalgia and other diseases for which Xyrem has not been approved, so-called off-label uses. The case has raised debate about free speech and how tightly the government may regulate discussions by doctors with one another. Under F.D.A. rules, doctors may prescribe drugs for any condition they see fit, but pharmaceutical companies are not allowed to promote drugs for off-label uses. Dr. Gleason is fighting the charges. But in March, David Tucker, a former sales manager for Jazz who worked with Dr. Gleason, pleaded guilty to a single felony count of introducing a misbranded drug into interstate commerce. Mr. Tucker has not been sentenced, but the charge carries a maximum sentence of up to three years in prison, according to Bruce Maloy, Mr. Tucker&#8217;s lawyer. Geoffrey Kaiser, the prosecutor handling the case, said he could not comment. In its prospectus, Jazz says it is close to settling the case by pleading guilty to the same felony charge as Mr. Tucker and paying $20.5 million in civil and criminal fines and restitution. With all the clouds over Xyrem, potential investors in Jazz may be pleased to know that it does sell another drug, Antizol, used to treat people who have been poisoned by antifreeze. Unfortunately &#151; or fortunately, perhaps &#151; Antizol&#8217;s market is even smaller than Xyrem&#8217;s. Antizol had sales of $2.6 million in the first three months of 2007. have TimesSelect?

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31scene.html Copyrights That No One Knows About Don&#8217;t Help Anyone That No One Knows About Don’t Help Anyone a quiz question for authors: To copyright a written work in the United States, you must (a) register it with the Copyright Office; (b) insert a notice that says “Copyright © 2007”; (c) insert a notice that says “All rights reserved.” Answer: none of the above. Under current law, a work is automatically copyrighted the moment it is “fixed in tangible form.” And these days, that copyright lasts virtually forever: 70 years after the death of the author, in most cases. Since there is no requirement to register a work and a copyright lasts so long, the legal owner of a work can be difficult to find, particularly when the work is more than a few decades old. When some librarians at tried to request permissions to digitize a collection of out-of-print books, they were unable to find more than 20 percent of the rights holders, despite persistent efforts. Failing to locate rights holders can be costly since copyright infringement may be subject to statutory damages of up to $150,000 an incident. The costs of locating rights holders are an example of what economists call transactions costs. Not surprisingly, high transactions costs tend to discourage transactions from occurring. The so-called orphan works problem was examined by the Copyright Office in a 2006 report in which it proposed legislation to address the transactions costs issues. Under its proposal, if you conducted a “diligent search” to locate a rights holder and still failed to find the owner, you would be off the hook. You could then incorporate the work in question into your own work, as long as you provided proper attribution. If the legitimate rights holder was subsequently found, he or she could not require that your work be withdrawn from circulation, but could collect “reasonable compensation” for use. But what is a “diligent search?” The report leaves the interpretation of this phrase up to the courts but suggests some relevant considerations: whether the work includes identification, the age of the work, whether the work can be found in public databases like Copyright Office records, and so on. The Copyright Office’s proposal is certainly a step in the right direction. Clarifying the rights and obligations of the buyers and sellers of copyrighted material would reduce transactions costs, and that should lead to a more efficient market for intellectual property. But does the proposed legislation go far enough? According to Law professor who is an expert in copyright law, it does not. He favors a system where authors receive an automatic copyright when they create new works, but they must register their copyright within 14 years to retain it past the initial period. (Unfortunately, such a registration requirement cannot apply to foreign creators because of international copyright treaties.) This is in the same spirit as the copyright law in place before 1964 requiring that copyrights be renewed at the Copyright Office in their 28th year. Materials that weren’t renewed fell into the public domain. Mr. Lessig envisions the Copyright Office as specifying the standards for registries but not necessarily operating them, since the private sector may be better positioned to build and maintain such systems. His inspiration is the domain name system used to register Internet sites. In that system, a standards body specifies the design, but it is up to individual organizations to carry out the necessary registries. The proposals by the Copyright Office and Mr. Lessig are not necessarily exclusive. If easily accessible copyright registries existed, the courts would probably find that simply searching the registries would satisfy the diligent search requirement. Creators of works with commercial potential would then have strong incentives to register their works. In such a world, a legal requirement to register works could be redundant, since the commercial incentives to register would be strong. Still, why take a chance? Establishing the expectations that works should be registered to receive the full protection of copyright law makes a lot of sense. Creating a registry is not that difficult from either a technological or a business perspective. The Copyright Clearance Center ( ) was established by a group of publishers in 1978 to provide rights clearance for printed works. The Harry Fox Agency ( ) serves as a clearinghouse for those who want to make recordings of songs, and there are plenty of Web sites devoted to image search to ease the sharing of photographs. But would the creators charge excessive fees if rights clearinghouses became widespread? I would argue that just the opposite would occur. An easy-to-use, efficient and competitive marketplace tends to push prices down. Reducing the transactions costs of acquiring reproduction rights potentially makes both creators and users of information better off. The orphan works legislation from the Copyright Office is still on the back burner in Congress. Let us hope that it soon gets the attention it deserves. Information plays a crucial role in today’s economy. Making it easy for creators and users of information to find each other should be a high priority for policy makers. Hal R.

Agrees to Buy Photobucket and Flektor THE ASSOCIATED PRESS Interactive Media, a unit of the , has agreed to acquire the photo-storage site Photobucket, just weeks after a public spat in which the popular networking site MySpace partly blocked content from Photobucket. MySpace, which is also owned by the News Corporation, lifted the block after about two weeks, but both sides have been silent on the details of their peacemaking. Separately, Fox also agreed to buy Flektor Inc., which offers Web-based tools for creating slide shows, recombined videos and other interactive presentations. Financial terms of the two deals were not disclosed. MySpace users often embed third-party photos, video and other material in their personal profile pages, and sites like Photobucket and YouTube, ’s video-sharing site, make that easy by providing the programming code to cut and paste into MySpace pages. The practice has made Photobucket one of the leading sites on the Internet, even though relatively few users access content directly through its home page. MySpace blocked Photobucket in April, after complaining that the hosting service had been encouraging users to incorporate an ad-supported slide show into their MySpace profiles. MySpace said the slide show violated its policies banning unauthorized commercial activity. Photobucket’s chief executive, Alex Welch, responded by accusing MySpace of limiting free expression and treating users as a commodity. He was more conciliatory two weeks later, saying the two had “established open lines of communication and procedures,” but he made no mention of negotiations over a sale of his company.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31testing.html Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Agree to Curb Animal Tests and PepsiCo Agree to Curb Animal Tests May 30 — Under pressure from animal rights advocates, two soft drink giants, , have agreed to stop directly financing research that uses animals to test or develop their products, except where such testing is required by law. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals sought the assurances after discovering studies financed by the companies that used animals like rats and chimpanzees to test taste perception and, in some cases, to bolster support for promotional health claims. PepsiCo said that it would stop directly financing animal experiments, including some it had financed through grants given to graduate students through its Gatorade Sports Science Institute. Elaine Palmer, a spokeswoman for PepsiCo, said that while the company had never supported the idea of animal testing, “We had not been policing it, so that part is new.” Coca-Cola and PepsiCo are the largest largest manufacturers to agree to the ban. Coca-Cola also said that it would discontinue a grant given to a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University who has been studying taste perception in rats, which share certain taste pathways with humans. Representatives of Coca-Cola and the university declined to say how much financing the company was providing or to elaborate on what the ultimate application of the research might be. A research associate at PETA, Shalin G. Gala, said, “We see these statements from Coke and Pepsi, massive global conglomerates, as the beginning of the end of all animal tests on food.” Scientists conducting basic research in animal models have cautioned against PETA’s hard line, saying their work, which may have medical benefits, would not be possible in many cases without help from corporate sponsors. “It’s very easy to characterize scientific research like this in a bad light,” said Dr. John A. DeSimone, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University who had been working under the Coca-Cola grant. “To do medical research, you sometimes need an animal model.” Not everyone agrees with Dr. DeSimone’s thinking, particularly when it involves tests on highly intelligent animals, as did a study involving a Coca-Cola scientist, financed by Nutrasweet, that cut open the faces of chimpanzees to study nerve impulses used in the perception of sweet tastes. “I have never found chimpanzee work justifiable,” said Dr. Alan Goldberg, director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Dr. Goldberg said that over the last 30 years, advances in alternatives to animal models, many of which are usually more scientifically precise, have already reduced the number of lab animals in use by 50 percent. “The bottom line for me is that I’d love to see animal studies disappear entirely,” Dr. Goldberg said. “In vitro models are cleaner.” The two soft drink giants are the latest companies to respond to scrutiny by PETA, which has mounted a campaign to denounce animal testing practices in the beverage industry, an industry that, unlike cosmetics or pharmaceuticals, had largely been unpublicized in the animal testing arena. In January, Roll International, the company that makes Pom Wonderful pomegranate juice, agreed to cease tests on animals after PETA disclosed a 2005 study financed by the company that tested the juice to see if it might relieve artificially induced erectile dysfunction in rabbits.

With the latest round of cuts, the company has announced plans to eliminate more than 10 percent of its work force since the start of 2007, when it became clear that two years of strong momentum behind the popular Razr mobile phone had collapsed. The company&#8217;s travails caused it to be the target of a proxy fight this year by the billionaire investor , who lost his bid this month for a board seat. Motorola said Wednesday that Mr. Icahn had received 717.1 million votes, compared with 931.7 million for John A. White, the company nominee he was closest to defeating. All other Motorola nominees got at least 1.6 billion votes. The company had been in the process of eliminating 3,500 jobs as part of a two-year cost-cutting plan to save $400 million. Motorola said the newly announced cuts, together with other cost-control measures, would save another $600 million in 2008. Motorola&#8217;s work force, which stood at 150,000 worldwide as recently as 2000, had declined to 66,000 at the beginning of the year. Wall Street gave modest approval to the latest cuts.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/media/31adco.html About Online Surveys, Traditional Pollsters Are: (C) Somewhat Disappointed Online Surveys, Traditional Pollsters Are: (C) Somewhat Disappointed May 27 — To traditional pollsters, a random survey adjusted to reflect the general population is the only way to measure public opinion properly. First developed in the 1940s by George Gallup, the father of modern polling, random sampling requires hours of costly legwork by an army of specially trained pollsters. But some survey companies that offer an Internet-based alternative to traditional polls are trying to make inroads, including a British one, YouGov, which plans to introduce its methods in the United States for the next presidential election. Working with a large panel of respondents who answer a range of questions through an online questionnaire, YouGov says it can predict election outcomes and consumer preferences with greater accuracy for far less money than ever before. To reflect a broad spectrum of opinion, the online panelists are recruited from all walks of life, and efforts are made to reach out to people who are less likely to be online, like the elderly and people with low incomes. Panelists are paid to participate — which is a big no-no in conventional polling — and their identities are validated by their home addresses and other personal details. To be sure, traditional pollsters and political consultants do not view online surveys as scientifically acceptable. The sampling of consumer opinion tapped through an online questionnaire cannot be as random as traditional measures, they argue, and it is easier for people to misrepresent themselves and their opinions online. Another critical difference is that in traditional polls, participation is voluntary, not paid. “Voter polling by the Internet is not yet viable,” said Joel Benenson, a Democratic pollster working for the presidential campaign of Senator of Illinois. “There are some uses for online polling, but it still misses out on too much of the population for us.” Despite the strong skepticism, Internet-based survey results are likely to get some publicity during the 2008 elections, and executives from companies that conduct these surveys hope that they can use the attention to gain credibility for their methods. YouGov, for example, has formed a partnership with Polimetrix, an online survey company based in Palo Alto, Calif., for surveys in the United States. Polimetrix, with a panel of one million people, plans to track the 2008 presidential election with a 50-state survey covering a minimum of 1,000 panelists in each state. “State-by-state election results are an important way for us to prove that our methodology delivers accurate results,” said Douglas Rivers, a political science professor who founded Polimetrix in 2004. “You can be lucky once, but not 50 times.” Professor Rivers said that the margin of error for Polimetrix surveys is similar to that of polls conducted by telephone. YouGov said that its own results in recent British elections were as close or closer to the actual votes than traditional polling methods. Mr. Benenson of the Obama campaign said that the Internet can be an effective way to test ad campaigns for specific populations, but that the variables are too great for judging the views of the general population. Polls on which public policy decisions are based still require walking the streets, said Leendert de Voogd, managing director of TNS Opinion in Brussels, one of the world’s largest polling companies. “It is still way too early for public opinion polling to go online,” Mr. de Voogd said. “Internet polling is like the Far West, with no rules, no sheriff and no reference points.” Among the surveys run by TNS Opinion is Eurobarometer, a survey of public opinion across Europe conducted for the “The decisions made on the basis of our polls are far too important to be left to an online survey,” Mr. de Voogd said. “Online polls can miss very important parts of the population.” For YouGov, developing a balanced panel of regular respondents from all sectors of the population is a priority, said Nadhim Zahawi, YouGov’s chief executive. “We expend a lot of effort reaching older people and other demographics” of people who are less likely to use the Internet, he said. Mr. Zahawi added that modern technology has made old-fashioned polls more cumbersome and unreliable. “Thanks to the increased use of mobile phones, the traditional pollsters face a growing problem of how to track down people at home,” he said. In London, The Daily Telegraph, which uses YouGov’s services roughly twice a month, appreciates the ability to query a large number of people in a short time.

A cardiologist who testified for Merck misrepresented his qualifications in the second trial last year, Judge Eldon E. Fallon of the Eastern District of Louisiana ruled. Jurors in that trial ruled in favor of Merck and against Evelyn Irvin Plunkett, whose first husband, Richard Irvin Jr., died of a heart attack after taking Vioxx for less than a month. The ruling was signed Tuesday, but was made available on the Internet a day later. The first trial, held in Houston during November and December 2005, ended with the jury deadlocked 8 to 1 in Merck’s favor, two jurors told The Associated Press. The cardiologist, Dr. Barry Rayburn, a professor of medicine at the , Birmingham, who was hired by Merck as a $600-an-hour expert witness, testified in the second trial that the drug could not have caused Mr. Irvin’s heart attack. Dr. Rayburn testified then that he was board-certified in cardiovascular disease. When Merck brought Dr. Rayburn as a witness in a second Vioxx trial, in a state court case in New Jersey, however, he testified during cross-examination that his board certification had lapsed. The ruling will not affect other cases because Dr. Rayburn took the board examinations for recertification last summer, has testified in only those two cases and has since been recertified, his lawyer said.

Prosecutors did not say why they dropped the count, a decision that came with no fanfare while jurors were out of the courtroom and issues were being discussed by the judge and lawyers. &#8220;At this time the prosecution rests,&#8221; an assistant United States attorney, Eric H. Sussman, told Judge Amy J. St. Eve of Federal District Court just before 3 p.m., ending the government&#8217;s case against Mr. Black after more than 10 weeks. Lawyers for Mr. Black and three co-defendants were scheduled to begin calling witnesses Thursday in what is expected to be a much less time-consuming case for the defense. Mr. Black, 62, and three other former executives are charged with swindling , a newspaper holding company, out of millions of dollars through the sale of The government says the scheme began with a decision in the late 1990s by Mr. Black, who was the company&#8217;s chairman, to sell hundreds of small Hollinger-owned community newspapers across the United States and Canada. Millions of dollars were paid to Hollinger in exchange for promises that it would not go into competition with the new owners of the papers. Prosecutors say that Mr. Black and two of his co-defendants, the former Hollinger vice presidents John A. Boultbee and Peter Y. Atkinson, illegally diverted much of the money to themselves with help from the corporate counsel, Mark S. Kipnis. Mr. Kipnis is also on trial. The prosecution rested its case amid bickering over 13 boxes that Mr. Black removed from the company&#8217;s headquarters in Toronto late in the afternoon of May 20, 2005, in defiance of a court order. On Wednesday, jurors saw pictures captured by security cameras of Mr. Black hauling the boxes out of the headquarters building and loading them into a waiting limousine. Mr. Black, who is charged with obstruction of justice in the incident, was forced to return the boxes, which sat on an evidence cart next to the jury box while the jurors viewed the security camera photos on a large screen. Judge St. Eve gave both sides until next Tuesday to file briefs expanding on their arguments. A defense lawyer for Mr. Black, Marc Martin, said he would ask her to drop other counts as well.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/business/31shelter.html Four Men, but Not Ernst & Young, Are Charged in Tax Shelter Case Men, but Not Ernst & Young, Are Charged in Tax Shelter Case current and former partners of the accounting firm Ernst & Young have been charged with tax fraud conspiracy over their work on questionable tax shelters. Skip to next paragraph Text of the Indictment The firm itself was not charged. But the indictment against the four, which was announced yesterday, did not mean that Ernst & Young, which has been under investigation since 2004, was entirely off the hook in a widening criminal investigation of the web of banks, accounting firms, law firms and investment boutiques that promoted questionable shelters. Those shelters have turned out to be bogus in the eyes of the , and prosecutors contend that they were shams or frauds that deprived the government of billions of dollars in tax revenue from the late 1990s through recent years. Federal prosecutors in Manhattan said yesterday that their investigation was continuing. The four Ernst & Young employees — Robert Coplan, who is also a former I.R.S. official, Richard Shapiro, Martin Nissenbaum and Brian Vaughan — were indicted by a federal grand jury in Manhattan on eight charges including conspiracy to defraud the I.R.S., tax evasion, making false statements to the I.R.S., and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the I.R.S. from 1998 through 2004. James Tucker, a lawyer for Mr. Vaughan, declined to comment yesterday. A lawyer for Mr. Nissenbaum said yesterday in a statement that his client had entered a plea of not guilty and “did not engage in any unlawful activity.” Jack Tigue, a lawyer for Mr. Shapiro, could not be reached for immediate comment. Lawyers for the other men did not return calls for comment. If convicted, each faces as much as 18 years in prison. The charges come nearly four years after Ernst & Young reached a settlement with the I.R.S., paying a $15 million penalty to resolve a civil investigation into the firm over its design and sales of questionable shelters. The civil settlement, however, did not prevent Ernst & Young from a criminal investigation less than one year later, as federal scrutiny of a rival accounting firm, KPMG, intensified, and as prosecutors made progress in teasing out the links between the web of firms that promoted tax shelters. But the 2003 settlement may make a criminal case against the firm more difficult. “Once you’ve got a civil settlement and a closing agreement with the I.R.S., it’s pretty hard for the Southern District to go back and get the firm — that bar makes it pretty hard,” argued a senior tax lawyer involved in the wider tax shelter investigation, referring to the federal Southern District of New York. Ernst & Young could still ultimately reach a deal that does not involve charges, but an acknowledgment of wrongdoing. KPMG reached a $456 million deferred-prosecution agreement with the Justice Department in 2005, as a condition of not being indicted — a near-certain corporate death sentence. Sixteen former KPMG employees, plus an outside lawyer and investment adviser, are set to stand trial at an undetermined date over their tax shelter work. Yesterday’s developments suggest that federal prosecutors are more likely to focus on individuals rather than firms in the tax shelter investigation. Robert Bennett, a lawyer for KPMG who persuaded the Justice Department not to indict the firm in 2005, said yesterday that “there’s a movement away from a knee-jerk reaction to impose vicarious liability on companies.” The indictment accuses the four Ernst & Young men of lying to the I.R.S. in the summer of 2002 during the audit of their employer that resulted in the $15 million penalty. “After being placed under oath, they sought to obstruct and impede the I.R.S. by providing false and misleading testimony concerning the origin, design, marketing and implementation of E.& Y.’s tax shelters,” the indictment said. In a statement yesterday, Ernst & Young said the four “were part of a small group within the firm, disbanded years ago, that was responsible for developing the transactions in question. None of the individuals was part of the firm’s management. ” It added that “Ernst & Young has cooperated with the government from the beginning of its investigation. We have voluntarily made many changes and enhancements to our tax practice. We have also made other changes to our tax practice pursuant to our 2003 agreement with the I.R.S., which the I.R.S. commissioner called a model for agreements with practitioners.” Titanic Sinks - Jigsaw Puzzle

In front of about 600 technology executives at the D: All Things Digital conference, which was sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, the two executives attracted the attention usually reserved for rock singers and Hollywood stars. However, attendees who came hoping for fireworks or a confrontation were disappointed. The mild tone to the session did not take anything away from the event and after discussing the past and present of the computing industry, the two were greeted with a standing ovation. After the event was over a number of the attendees who are veterans of decades in the computer industry said the joint appearance was the most memorable moment of any of the many conferences they had attended. Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs largely pioneered the personal computer industry beginning in 1975 and 1976 and they spent part of the evening sharing memories of those days. Today "we ship these computers with one or two gigabytes and nobody remembers 128 kilobytes," Mr. Jobs said. Apple and Microsoft were business partners at the start of the computer era beginning in 1977 when Mr. Gates supplied a copy of the BASIC programming language for the Apple II computer. Later, Mr. Gates made an early bet on writing software for the Macintosh, two years before the computer was introduced in 1984. Neither was willing to acknowledge the possibility that the personal computer era they helped create would end any time soon. "The PC has proven to be very resilient," Mr. Jobs said. At the same time they called themselves believers in the explosion of hand-held communications devices, also known as "Post PC devices." Mr. Gates said he was sometimes frustrated by the fact that the players in the industry changed so quickly. "I miss it when people come and go. It's nice when people stick around and it gives us some context," he said.During a question and answer period at the end of the session both men were asked to comment on the other's strengths. Mr. Gates singled out Mr. Jobs intuitive aesthetic sense. "I'd give a lot to have Steve's taste," Mr. Gates said, drawing laughter from the audience. "The way he does things, it's just different." Mr. Jobs returned the compliment, noting that Mr. Gates skills at building business partnerships were something that eluded him in his first decade at Apple. Asked to comment on today's computer industry and the youth culture that it markets to, both men pointed to examples of applications of computer technology that had been readily adopted by seniors. Mr. Gates said that when he showed the Microsoft Surface, the touch computing system introduced on Wednesday to a group of chief executives at his home several weeks ago, he was surprised they were more enthusiastic about the product than he was. The executives, he noted came from a generation that was not comfortable with keyboards. They were particularly interested in a technology that allowed them to control things on a display screen by pointing and moving them directly with their fingers. Neither man was willing to say harsh things about the other and Mr. Jobs summed up his feelings by quoting from a Beatles song: "&#61486;'You and I have memories longer than the road that stretches out ahead,' that's clearly true here," he said.

Earlier, the government, seeking to rein in speculation, tripled the tax on trading stamps. Thursday, May 31 — Chinese stock markets plummeted Wednesday and continued their decline in early trading Thursday after the authorities in Beijing moved to impose higher taxes on trading activity. Skip to next paragraph The tax increase, which was announced early Wednesday, was the government’s latest attempt to rein in the world’s hottest stock market as a growing number of economists and analysts warn about the danger of a market bubble. Investors reacted by selling shares and pushing the benchmark indexes on the two main stock exchanges sharply lower. The Shanghai composite index plunged 6.5 percent, to 4,053.09. The Shenzhen composite index dropped nearly 7.2 percent, to 1,199.45. At midday Thursday, the Shanghai exchange was down nearly 3 percent from Wednesday’s close and the Shenzhen 5 percent. When Chinese shares fell sharply at the end of February, markets around the world tumbled in tandem on worries of broader trouble ahead for the nation’s economy. But on Wednesday, other Asian markets were down only modestly. The benchmark Hang Seng index in Hong Kong declined 0.86 percent Wednesday, and in Tokyo the Nikkei index of 225 issues slid a little less than 0.5 percent. In its move Wednesday, the Chinese finance ministry tripled the tax on stock transactions to 0.3 percent, which analysts said was probably not enough to destroy the bull market, though it could dampen the mood of speculators. “The psychological impact on investors could be larger than the actual effect of the duty adjustment,” Shen Minggao, an economist at , wrote in a research note. Most analysts said they did not think that a sharp drop in stock prices would harm the Chinese economy, which continues to grow robustly. Some said they expected the markets to resume their climb quickly unless the government announced further measures. “If the market expectation is that share prices are going to rise 50 percent in the next six months, then the transaction tax is affordable,” said Dong Tao, chief Asia economist at The tax was increased at a time many Chinese seem to have gone mad for stocks. Professionals, retirees, shop owners, students — even watermelon hawkers — are said to be lining up to buy stocks in hopes of getting in on the rally. More than 300,000 accounts are being opened every day, regulators say. Brokerage houses are overrun with day traders and people who pack lunches to spend the day staring at stock price monitors. One indication of the mood is a popular cellphone greeting that is being sent around Shanghai. The greeting replaces the national anthem with a call for all investors to rise up and buy, buy, buy stocks. “Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves” from the national anthem has been replaced by: “Arise, ye who haven’t opened an account! Pour your gold and silver into the hot market.” Chinese seem eager to buy stocks not only because they have watched prices soar in the last two years, but also because there are few other opportunities to get a good return on investments. Until the past year, much of the speculative money in China was going into real estate, particularly in Shanghai and Beijing. Policy makers chilled real estate speculation with a series of tax and administrative measures, only to see the speculation move into stocks. Many investors are betting almost everything on stocks. Some said that even the sell-off on Wednesday was unlikely to restrain optimism. “There are too many small investors in the market,” said Fan Ligen, a retired Shanghai clerk who has been investing in stocks since 1992. “They are like hundreds of ants swarming on pieces of meat on the ground.” In the February sell-off, prices plummeted 8.8 percent after the Shanghai composite index surpassed the 3,000-point level for the first time. It was the biggest one-day drop in a decade. But with prices down, new investors rushed in, sensing an opportunity to buy on the cheap. They were right. In mid-March, the Shanghai index retraced its losses, again exceeding 3,000. Early this month, it passed 4,000. This week, it was pushing toward 4,400 on record volume. “Our market is different from the ones Japan,” said Li Wenwei, a banker who was at a brokerage house in Shanghai. “Those markets obey the rules of the market, while ours doesn’t. There are bubbles in the market. The index is already too high, and there is a lot of risk in the market.” In many ways, the stock market has come into line with China’s phenomenal economic growth, a bullish market to match a bullish economy that is growing close to 11 percent a year, creating worries about the possibility of hypergrowth and inflation, a stock market crash and, potentially, civil unrest. The rise is extraordinary. Since July 2005, when a bearish market turned bullish, share prices have soared in Shanghai by more than 300 percent and 400 percent in Shenzhen, even with Wednesday’s drop. That decline, though, was especially sharp — given regulations that no single stock rise or fall more than 10 percent in a trading day. Some stocks fell the limit Wednesday, and questions arose whether they might continue dropping Thursday. “I think the market will still go down a bit tomorrow,” Mr. Li, the banker in Shanghai, said. “My two stocks fell today. But I won’t sell them yet. I’m not nervous about the fall since my investment is from my savings.” David Barboza reported from Shanghai and Keith Bradsher from Hong Kong.
