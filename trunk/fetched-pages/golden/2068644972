http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6706565.stm | Children 'meet net friends often' 30 May 2007, 23:41 GMT 00:41 'meet net friends often' Children often surf the net behind their parents' backs, research says Many children are meeting up with people they first encountered on the internet - and their parents know nothing about it, a study claims. Web security firm Garlik surveyed hundreds of eight to 15-year-olds and found 20% have met an online friend in person - and one-in-20 do so regularly. Just 7% of parents were aware of their child's behaviour, the study suggested. Garlik, which advises people about data protection on the web, said youngsters were putting themselves in danger. The firm polled 500 young people about their online habits - and 500 parents were asked about their attitudes. It found that 40% of children regularly visit websites that are specifically prohibited by their parents and many give out sensitive information without parental consent. Details divulged include full name (30%), home address (12%), school details (46%) and family photos (9%). One in 10 admitted to being cyber-bullied - but only half said they had spoken to their parents about the ordeal. Despite 90% of parents saying they monitored their offspring's internet usage, more than half of the youngsters admitted to surfing the internet when their parents did not know. Garlik boss Tom Ilube labelled the research a "shocking wake-up call" to British parents. "The web is a wonderful place to explore - but young people continue to make themselves vulnerable by not applying the same caution online as they would in person."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6708927.stm backs 31 May 2007, 14:29 GMT 15:29 backs Nuclear reactors need enriched uranium An international scheme to produce a controlled supply of enriched uranium has won support from the US and Russia. The US Congress Foreign Affairs Committee has approved a bill that supports the creation of an global nuclear fuel bank. It would be supervised by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which inspects reactors. The aim is to end uncertainty over states that enrich uranium and if they plan to use it for fuel or weapons. The fuel bank would produce enriched uranium, which is a necessary ingredient in nuclear power reactors, keeping stocks of it for sale. Countries that are building nuclear reactors would not have to make their own uranium fuel - they could simply buy it from the bank. The US decision comes less than two weeks after Russia and Kazakhstan signed an inter-governmental agreement with the IAEA to consider setting up such a facility in Siberia. Concerns over nuclear proliferation have most recently been raised over Iran, which is building a reactor in Bushehr and has a uranium enrichment facility in Natanz. Co-sponsor of the bill, US Democrat Tom Lantos, stated, "Those who truly seek to develop nuclear power solely for peaceful means will jump at the chance to take part in this fuel bank." Uranium is usually enriched using hundreds or thousands of centrifuges - cylindrical rotors moving at high-speed in an almost friction-free environment - that slowly separate uranium from its ore. Countries will simply not agree to it Frank Barnaby, security expert But because similar equipment is also used to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs, it is often difficult to be certain about the true intentions of states that build them. According to the IAEA, Iran has constructed more than 1,300 centrifuges at Natanz. Iran insists that its nuclear ambitions are peaceful, but the international community has imposed sanctions on the country over fears that it wants to develop a nuclear weapon. A guaranteed uranium access to Iran could provide a possible solution to the political dilemma. It would remove the need for Iran to enrich uranium for fuel at all. It would also allow the IAEA to more accurately measure how much nuclear fuel is being used, making it easier to spot if any uranium is diverted for non-peaceful purposes. However, Frank Barnaby, a security expert at the Oxford Research Group, an independent security charity, does not believe it will work: "Countries will simply not agree to it," he said. "Iran says it has an unalienable right to enrich uranium to fuel nuclear power reactors, and there is no reason for it to choose to use the bank." A recent paper published by the IAEA said that the be supervised by the IAEA but "financed on a commercial basis or by the [IAEA] Member States". The US has committed $50m of funding to the bank, matching $50 million that was offered in 2006 by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, a US-based charity. Following an agreement in May 2007 between Kazakhstan and Russia, a site for the now being considered in the remote city of Irkutsk, in Eastern Siberia. There is already a large uranium enrichment plant in the area. Kazakhstan has about 20 per cent of the world's uranium ore and it reportedly has plans to triple production to 15,000 tonnes by the end of the decade. The proposed Irkutsk will be discussed at a meeting of the IAEA's Board of Governors in June 2007. Despite these commitments by the US and Russia, security expert Frank Barnaby says that other countries are likely to oppose the plans. He said: "The UK and Japan have historically made objections to the idea of a they see enriching uranium as a secret operation and any international efforts to create a bank will mean information will leak, which threatens their security." to push for new Iran sanctions West 'fails' on Iran nuclear fuel Iran nuclear official 'detained' Solana urges US to talk to Iran EU agrees Iran nuclear sanctions What's behind the row between the UN and Tehran over its nuclear programme ElBaradei pushes 'third way' Tehran alarm at US tough talk Quick guide: Iran nuclear crisis Iran's key nuclear sites From atom to bomb How should world deal with Iran?

Apple says that starting from mid-June, Apple TV users will stream YouTube content onto their televisions. At present, Apple TV users can only access content stored in Apple's iTunes music and video library system. The move may raise copyright issues for Apple, as YouTube faces a number of infringement lawsuits. YouTube is currently being sued for $1bn (£506m) by MTV-owner Viacom, after users uploaded thousands of Viacom-owned videos to the service without its permission. However, following Apple's announcement of the tie-up with YouTube, Viacom struck a conciliatory tone. "We're always vigilant about protecting our copyrights," said a Viacom spokeswoman. "But we would welcome the opportunity to license our content to Apple as we do with all distributors." Apple added that YouTube members would also onto their YouTube accounts on Apple TV.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6354259.stm | Telescope boost to UK astronomy 30 May 2007, 12:25 GMT 13:25 boost to UK astronomy Science reporter, BBC News Vista was a payment in kind for the UK joining Eso On a dusty mountaintop in the Atacama desert of northern Chile, a large telescope funded and led by Britain is taking shape. The £36m facility is gradually being assembled near the Chilean peak of Cerro Paranal. Vista (Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy) will be part of the European Southern Observatory (Eso). Eso is a research organisation comprising 13 member countries - including the UK. The telescope will use infrared wavelengths to detect objects that are too distant or too cool to be seen using the visible spectrum. Vista's task has been likened to looking for needles in astronomical haystacks. Its solution is to combine a telescope with a moderately large (4m) mirror to detect distant objects, with a large field of view, so it can survey a large area. Most telescopes of 4m or above have a narrow field of view; Vista has the widest field of view for a telescope of its size. Getting the best quality pictures from a relatively wide field telescope required a careful balancing of different factors when it came to designing the telescope. 4m telescope will survey the Southern Hemisphere sky Widest field of view for a telescope of its size Near infrared camera with 67 million pixels of mean size Interior of camera must operate in a vacuum at -200C Camera weighs about as much as an Indian elephant Vista's design, which uses two mirrors, produces a large field of view but at the expense of some residual image distortions. These distortions can be corrected by lenses. But if too much bending of light is done by lenses, they make different wavelengths of light focus in slightly different places. This blurs the resulting image. Mirrors, on the other hand, bend all wavelengths of light the same. So Vista's designers came to the following compromise: most of the light coming into the telescope would be bent by the mirrors. Residual distortions would then be corrected by a series of three lenses inside the telescope's camera. "Vista is very much a system. You won't get a nice image from the telescope alone, you need the telescope and the camera working together," says Jim Emerson, Vista project leader, from Queen Mary, University of London. See how Vista compares to the Very Large Telescope Vista's 3m-long, 2.9 tonne camera - the biggest of its kind in the world - is another impressive feat of engineering. "It's a huge beast," says Kim Ward, Vista's camera manager, "It has the largest array of infrared detectors and everything about it is just massive. Part of this has come about through having to make it earthquake-proof." The camera may be the biggest of its type anywhere The Vista site is on an active seismic zone. Thus, the camera had to be more sturdy than would normally be necessary. It must weak and medium-strength earthquakes and survive largely intact through strong ones. The sensitive infrared detectors are required to work at a temperature of -200C, so the camera has a cryogenic system to keep the interior cool; it must also operate in a vacuum. "We have pumps and coolers attached around the camera to maintain the temperature and the vacuum," says Kim Ward. The camera, he says, is a bit "like an inside-out spacecraft." Vista will through the smog of interstellar dust clouds that obscure much of our galaxy. It is designed to detect very faint galaxies and will very cool cosmic objects that do not emit much visible light. The data will tell astronomers a lot more about these objects. But in some cases, the telescope will identify faint astronomical bodies for follow-up observations using other observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope. In one of the first surveys planned for Vista, astronomers will look at an area of the sky known as the Cosmos Field. Eagle Nebula: In the infrared (L) and at Hubble's visible wavelengths By looking deep into the Cosmos Field, Vista will also be looking a long way back in time, to the Universe as it was in its early years. The aim will be to understand how galaxies - like the Milky Way - are assembled from their constituent parts. "Vista will be looking for old galaxies in two square degrees of sky. The idea is that galaxies are assembled bit-by-bit. Galaxies accrete more and more matter with time," says Jim Emerson. "So galaxies should look reasonably chaotic a long time ago. As other pieces get added, they should start to look statistically more like galaxies do nowadays." At the other end of the spectrum of tasks Vista will carry out is a project called the Vista Hemisphere Survey. This will aim to survey the entire southern hemisphere. By contrast with the Cosmos Field survey, which goes very deep but only surveys a small volume of the sky, the Hemisphere Survey will not peer very deep into space, but will survey a large volume of sky. The Atacama is one of the best places to do astronomy in the world Astronomers will carry out lots of short exposures of one part of the sky and then carry on to the next part. Even so, Jim Emerson explains: "It will be about four magnitudes deeper than the previous all-sky survey in the infrared. And it will be in more wavelength bands." How objects in the sky look at different wavelengths in the electromagnetic spectrum will help astronomers classify them. They will then hone in on rare objects. "You can do a lot of science on these objects if you can pin down their properties precisely. You can also find exciting new objects such as very high-Redshift quasars," says Jim Emerson. Quasars are compact, luminous objects thought to be powered by supermassive black holes and are thought to have played an important role in the evolution of the Universe. Those at the highest "Redshifts" are the most distant, and therefore the youngest, class of quasars. "You don't know where rare objects are to start with. So you have to observe the whole hemisphere to find these things, and you need to find several as finding one doesn't give you a statistical sample of these objects." Other Vista projects include: an effort to map the "bulge" of the Milky Way which will help give a better idea of our galaxy's shape a study of the Milky Way's galactic plane, which will search for star-forming regions a survey of the Magellanic Clouds, the two nearest galaxies to the Milky Way using the colours of galaxies in order to measure their distances and to map their 3-D distributions These surveys will take about five years to complete. Some projects can only be undertaken at certain times of the year. Others are dependent on having certain atmospheric conditions. "All the projects should produce science results that help answer questions we already have. But the most exciting thing may be something we have no idea about that we discover not having set out to discover it," says Professor Emerson. When the UK was negotiating to join Eso, Vista became an in-kind payment towards the subscription for joining. All the crucial elements of the telescope are now in place except for the main mirror. The Russian company polishing the primary mirror needed more time to complete the task, delaying its arrival in Chile. "Normally, telescope mirrors are subtly curved. This one looks a bit more like a saucer. It is curvier than usual and comes up a lot at the edges," says Professor Emerson. "No one has polished a mirror this big of this shape before." The secondary mirror is now complete and in Chile. The telescope's primary mirror will be finished in July. It will be flown to Chile on an Antonov transport plane from Moscow. It is hoped that Vista will its first pictures towards the end of 2007. VISTA'S WIDE FIELD OF VIEW Telescopes of 4m or above generally have a narrow field of view. The 8.2m Very Large Telescope (VLT) falls into this category The 4m Vista telescope is an exception.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/technology/6704013.stm privacy policy 'is vague' 31 May 2007, 08:12 GMT 09:12 privacy policy 'is vague' Technology editor, BBC News website Google's online influence worries some privacy campaigners Elements of Google's privacy policy are "vague" and need to be made more precise, the firm's global privacy counsel has told BBC News. Peter Fleischer said the company "could do better" with policy statements that explained why user information was sometimes shared with third parties. Mr Fleischer said Google would never give "identifiable personal data" to third parties, including advertisers. Google's privacy policy has come under scrutiny in recent weeks. A working party of European Information Commissioners has written to Google to ask the firm to explain why it holds on to users' web history data for up to two years. Google has said it would respond by the end of June. There is also growing concern from privacy campaigners over the implication of Google's proposed purchase of advertising firm DoubleClick. The ad company helps link up advertising agencies, marketers and web site publishers hoping to put adverts online. Campaigners argue that the two firms will have an unprecedented amount of information on users' web-surfing habits. In an interview with the BBC News website, Mr Fleischer said: "The general principle is that we are going to maintain the privacy of our users; that is pretty fundamental. There are some very limited circumstances in which we would share user data with third parties "We will never transfer to third parties, including advertisers, any personally identifiable information about our users. "Our goal is to be as transparent as possible with our users when it comes to privacy. That transparency builds trust and we will succeed or fail on whether our users trust us." Mr Fleischer said its privacy policy was written to be as "clear and simple as possible". But he admitted two elements of the policy statement needed attention. When we use third parties to assist us in processing your personal information, we require that they comply with our Privacy Policy and any other appropriate confidentiality and security measures. We may also share information with third parties in limited circumstances, including when complying with legal process, preventing fraud or imminent harm, and ensuring the security of our network and services. "There is a constant process of trying to be clear with language and improve notices," said Mr Fleischer. "We ought to better than that now that you have drawn my attention to that particular clause," he said, referring to the first clause. After being questioned on the second element, he said: "It is kind of vague. I wish we could do better on that one." Mr Fleischer said Google shared data with third parties when it outsourced a part of its operation. "The clause essentially says that if we hire outsourcing functions to provide something like virus scanning or security models, we at Google would still be practices for our end users." He said the clause also covered the movement of data between Google Inc, the US-registered company, and its affiliates, such as Google in the UK. "There are some very limited circumstances in which we would share user data with third parties. One of them would be if we were under a legal order from the police to do so. He added: "Very rarely there will be a case where the police say someone is in actual danger and needs our help. "We have had a case when someone was kidnapped and Gmail was being used for a hostage ransom demand. These are incredibly rare situations. "We are not going to hide behind procedures." Mr Fleischer said the company would also share user data with third-party security experts if Google was the subject of a massive hacker attack. "This is purely hypothetical but we might need to share user data with security experts to find out who is hacking, and where is this coming from." In a statement a Google spokesman said: "We write our privacy policy so that it is simple and easy to understand. "Our users' privacy is a priority for us, and we're continually reviewing our privacy policy clauses to make them even more transparent. We welcome all comments and feedback that helps us with this." could face in-depth probe 29 Google to list top 100 searches 22 founder's success secrets 22
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6639417.stm up to Facebook fears 9 May 2007, 13:54 GMT 14:54 up to Facebook fears Internet law professor Michael Geist says attempts to block social media sites such as Facebook are misguided. Facebook has seen rapid growth Facebook, the enormously popular social media website, has attracted a remarkable amount of attention in recent weeks. On the heels of student suspensions for posting negative comments about school officials on Facebook, and the integral role the social media site played for student expression during the horrific events at Virginia Tech, the Province of Ontario in Canada last week announced that it was banning access to the site for thousands of bureaucrats and elected officials. While the merits of Facebook are open to debate - some love it, others hate it, and many simply do not understand what the fuss is about - there should be no debating the fact that many of these policy responses are unnecessary, knee-jerk reactions to an emerging social phenomenon that is poorly understood. Facebook launched in February 2004 as a social network site for Harvard University. The site allowed users to chat, post photos and comments, as well as connect with fellow students with common interests through online groups. The site quickly grew, first to other universities and later to high schools. By last summer, it was used by more than 30,000 educational institutions in the US, Canada, and other English-speaking countries, with roughly eight million users. Last September, Facebook opened its virtual doors to the general public by permitting registrations from people in hundreds of geographic areas. The decision, which created some apprehension among the Facebook community, caused the site to explode in popularity. Facebook is used amongst groups of friends Today, there are 21 million Facebook users worldwide and the site is adding 100,000 new users each week. The site has achieved remarkable success in Britain, where it was recently ranked as the twentieth most visited website in the country, up twenty-fold from the prior year. While the number of UK Facebook users was estimated at 200,000 last September, by March 2007 that number had grown to more than 1.3 million registered users. In fact, more than 40 U.K. universities have signed up to Facebook, leading to some criticism that the site "institutionalises gossip". Although most people associate Facebook with social activities, the site can be very useful in mobilising interest around political and policy issues. For example, six weeks ago, Amber MacArthur, a Canadian television reporter, launched a new group called Canadians for Net Neutrality. Today the group has more than 1,100 participants, sharing ideas and concerns about whether Canadian Internet service providers are treating content and applications in an equitable manner. The recent backlash against Facebook has generally on centred around two concerns - derogatory comments and workplace productivity - ironically missing the real sources of concern such as the privacy impact of posting deeply personal information. Many Facebook users openly comment about issues of concern. That naturally includes students posting thoughts about fellow students and teachers or about supervisors at their part-time jobs. Attempts to block such activity are not only bound to fail, but they ultimately cut off decision makers, school officials, and community leaders from their communities In recent months, an Ottawa grocery chain fired several of its employees after company officials discovered negative comments on Facebook, while several Ontario schools have suspended students for posting "offensive" comments about school officials. While companies are obviously entitled to establish the ground rules for employee behaviour, it is hard to see how schools can justify suspending students for simply speaking their minds. It is certainly appropriate to take action against cyber-bullying, however students exercising legitimate free speech should not be punished simply because the speech occurs in a semi-private online forum rather than in a semi-private discussion on school grounds out of earshot of school officials. In fact, educators should seize these opportunities to teach students about both the benefits and drawbacks of social media, while encouraging them to use the tools in positive ways. Facing up to fears The Ontario government ban against Facebook is even more puzzling. Premier Dalton McGuinty indicated that the government does not see how it adds value to the workplace, yet the decision will only further isolate the government from the very public that it serves. Is there really no benefit to have government policy makers access and participate in the hundreds of groups discussing Ontario health care issues? Would it be so bad for elected officials to actually engage with their constituents in a social network environment? The attempts to block Facebook or punish users for stating their opinions fails to appreciate that social network sites are simply the internet generation's equivalent of the town hall, the school cafeteria, or the workplace water cooler - the place where people come together to exchange both ideas and idle gossip. Attempts to block such activity are not only bound to fail, but they ultimately cut off decision makers, school officials, and community leaders from their communities. The answer does not lie in banning Facebook or the other emerging social media sites, but rather in facing up to Facebook fears and learning to use these new tools to engage and educate.

Users e-mails have not been delivered to their intended recipients as other ISPs block e-mail traffic from Tiscali. Tiscali has not said how many of its 1.8m UK customers are affected by the outage which started eight days ago. It said engineers were "taking urgent action" to block spammers using its e-mail service to send messages. A statement on the Tiscali website read: "We have been targeted by spammers using our service, which in turn has meant other ISPs have taken measures to block mail sent by Tiscali. This is not affecting all delivery addresses. Some mail continues to be delivered as normal." The ISP said it was currently installing new hardware and updating its spam filters. Spamhaus is certainly not seeing anything that would justify major blocking "This work will be complete today. It is likely to take seven to 10 days for these changes to take full effect across receiving e-mail providers." But some spam experts have expressed surprise that Tiscali has said its current problems are the result of spammers. "There have been major problems in the past," said Richard Cox of Spamhaus, a not-for-profit organisation of IT professionals that tracks spammers and publishes free real time databases of offending addresses used by many big businesses and ISPS. "Spamhaus is certainly not seeing anything that would justify major blocking, unless it is being targeted at one or two specific networks." The organisation uses a network of anonymous e-mail addresses to "trap" spam. "These are on most spammers lists so as soon as spam starts hitting those traps we know its happening," he explained. Spamhaus does not use services such as hotmail, Yahoo or AOL for their spam traps so if these alone were being targeted they would not appear on the Spamhaus radar. Mr Cox speculated that the problem could be the result of a technical failure at Tiscali, something the ISP denies.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/technology/6685253.stm freedoms do we want online? 23 May 2007, 16:50 GMT 17:50 freedoms do we want online? We can't take an all or nothing approach to online expression, argues Bill Thompson. Burma was one of the countries criticised for web censorship The idea that the internet is an unregulated space where free expression is the guiding principle and we can all talk openly took another blow last week with the latest report on net filtering from the Open Net Initiative. Their study found many countries were filtering websites and email, and some were blocking new services such as net telephony. China, Burma, Tunisia and Iran were among the countries mentioned, and the overall message was that things are getting worse for the open internet. I had been discussing many of the same issues just a few days earlier at a seminar at Wolfson College, Cambridge, where I am spending a term as a Press Fellow. My colleague, Chinese journalist and blogger Michael Anti, pointed out that although political expression is tightly controlled in China the government is not really interested in other aspects of people's lives, while here in the UK we can talk about democracy but other forms of speech are restricted for legal and commercial reasons. He has a point. The ONI report only looked at official, state-sanctioned filtering, and it did not consider the situation in the UK or US where most controls are imposed by companies trying to protect their reputation or achieve competitive advantage. Limits on free speech My ability to say what I want on private forums is limited. Yahoo censored Flikr comments Here we see numerous examples of limits on free speech. Apple has repeatedly sued journalists for revealing details of its product plans. A Romanian blogger has been threatened with prosecution by a US internet radio station for revealing how to link directly to its audio streams and bypass the media player it wants you to use. Respected online publisher Jon Newton has been sued over the comments added to an article he posted on the popular p2pnet news site. Yahoo! has been roundly criticised for removing comments made on the Flickr photosharing site it owns after photographer Rebekka Gudleifsdóttir complained that a commercial company was selling prints of her photos without permission. And we recently saw the fiasco that resulted when the group that manages copy protection for the new generation of high capacity disks tried to use the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act to stop people publishing a code that with the right software can be used to decrypt some HD-DVD titles. These sorts of restrictions happen all the time, and rarely involve direct government action, as we can see on the Chilling Effects website where there are copies of thousands of 'cease and desist' letters from lawyers trying to remove web content, including some from the BBC. Most of us recognise that there are limits on what we can say or do, limits imposed to benefit the wider society and which serve us all, even if they sometimes seem onerous. The point is not that speech is controlled but the openness with which it is done, the way that limits are discussed and agreed on and the ease with which unreasonable restrictions to freedom of expression can be challenged. There is also a difference between censorship imposed by governments and the restrictions put in place by people or organisations for themselves. Yahoo has been criticised for removing comments on Flikr Yahoo! says that it made a mistake in taking down Rebekka Gudleifsdóttir's posting, but in fact if the discussion went against the terms of use and included abusive comments then it is under no obligation to host them. Just as I can't expect to be allowed to wander into your home and shout at you because you spend your time watching trash TV instead of reading improving books, so my ability to say what I want on private forums is limited. The same principle applies to Slashdot, Digg, The Guardian or any other organisation that hosts content. Every day I delete dozens of spam comments from my blog and I don't consider that to be unreasonable censorship. If the controls are too onerous then the discussion will move elsewhere. If the policy is inconsistently applied or seen to be biased then that will itself form the basis of public discussion, perhaps in other forums. I'm happy to allow anyone to decide for themselves what they will or will not publish on their own site or service, but it gets a lot more dangerous when we allow individuals or governments to use legal remedies to stop other people speaking out, as with the furore over the HD-DVD key. And the limits on speech that are acceptable when imposed by private companies as part of their terms and conditions would not be acceptable when imposed by governments. In an open society we want to be as permissive as possible, limiting free expression only when it is absolutely necessary, and debating such limitations openly. But we should not expect the rules to be straightforward or universal. We need to take a more nuanced approach to this fundamental issue, one which allows that different nations, cultures and groups will have different standards, and one which also respects the difference between public and private provision of spaces for publication and debate. Unfortunately, as I've pointed out in the past, nearly all of the open spaces we occupy online are in fact privately controlled and managed. The real danger in the coming years might not be that governments look at what China has achieved with its 'Great Firewall' and decide to emulate it, but that the companies behind our online gathering places become more conservative, more limiting and more repressive, while we find we have nowhere else to go. Perhaps it's time for the Open Net Initiative to have a look at filtering policies at Facebook, Bebo and MySpace as well as Burma, Iran and Saudi Arabia.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6704029.stm tool tracks city graffiti 30 May 2007, 11:35 GMT 12:35 tool tracks city graffiti Some people call it art, others vandalism US cities are battling the problem of vandalism head on with a hi-tech system that analyses and tracks graffiti and its perpetrators. In the US, cleaning up graffiti is estimated to cost about $10bn (£5bn) per year. Rather than simply obliterate the graffiti, the system keeps a permanent record of it which allows police to compile a database of similar daubings. This surveillance of graffiti has angered some privacy advocates. Graffiti Tracker, the brainchild of graduate student and crime analyst Timothy Kephart, uses global positioning systems (GPS), digital photography and computer databases to track and catch graffiti artists. The system - dubbed Graffiti Analysis/Intelligence Tracking System (GAITS) - takes pictures of graffiti, using GPS cameras that record the date, time and exact location. It then extracts information from the photographs and provides reports of each incident of graffiti which can be matched against other graffiti stored on a computer database in an effort to track down the perpetrator. Keeping a database of known graffiti means offenders can be charged with multiple counts of vandalism. The ability to locate where graffiti occurs means work can also be tracked. In one case, the system showed that graffiti was located in close proximity to a suspect's house, the park he used and the school he attended, providing compelling evidence for the police. Mr Kephart devised the system after he analysed more than 450 gang graffiti photographs for his master's thesis. He identified a series of trends, particularly relating to gangs which US police authorities believe are responsible for much of the graffiti in cities such as Los Angeles. It is estimated that there are 720 street gangs in Los Angeles with some 40,000 members. British PM Tony Blair helps the graffiti clean-up Much of graffiti contained coded messages to rival gangs as well as codes to identify the particular gang responsible for it, Kephart discovered. So far, 20 cities in California, Nevada and Nebraska have bought the system and Mr Kephart expects sales to double in the next 12 months. While the authorities regard graffiti as vandalism, others are not so sure the high-tech system is the best way to tackle the problem. "I have never heard anything so hilarious," said Simon Davies, head of Privacy International. "The money they are spending on this should be reinvested in urban regeneration, using graffiti as an art form. "Surveillance tracking destroys self-esteem and there are more effective solutions to urban dysfunction," he said. paint to help deter graffiti 29 Teenage boys warned over graffiti 22 Graffiti art encouraged at castle 15 and West New graffiti planned for station 11
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6701855.stm win for Alzheimer's tool 29 May 2007, 17:07 GMT 18:07 win for Alzheimer's tool The winning entry is designed to help people with Alzheimer's An online screensaver and social network for people with Alzheimer's and their carers has won a Microsoft-led software design prize. "Memories are made of this" was designed by Said Dajani, website manager for the Alzheimer's Society. The tool includes a screen saver which carers could use as a memory prompt, uploading text, images and video clips. Microsoft's engineers will now turn the concept into reality, with the aim of implementing the system. DesignIT is an annual competition to champion the work of software designers and reverse the stereotypes of IT managers as "geeks". Professionals were invited to submit plans for computer systems which demonstrated creativity as well as "tackling social and human interest problems experienced by charities". "It was a public vote - so that was very gratifying," said Mr Dajani. "More and more people are coming across dementia, affecting them and their family. "It is estimated that one million people will have a form of dementia by 2025." Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia. It is a physical disease which causes the chemistry and structure of the brain to change, leading to the death of brain cells. Mr Dajani said the idea behind the design was to help carers and those with Alzheimer's to remember important facts about their lives. "The screensaver is a virtual scrapbook - a carer and person with dementia can work together to upload pictures, video, text. "We have found that an offline scrapbook has been of real benefit to both and we want to extend this to the digital world. It puts people in contact with their memories." Artists interpreted the designs for an exhibition. Here, Annabel Emson was inspired by a plan centred on reducing CO2 emissions The second part of the scheme is the creation of a social network for people with dementia. "There is definitely a need for a shared, secured network so that people with dementia can talk with each other," said Mr Dajani. "This will mean people with dementia will not have to deal with complicated log-ins but could chat to other members of the network who are online at the same time." As part of the scheme artists have been working to interpret the designs for an exhibition in London this week to showcase the work. "We're very honoured. The artist came in to see us and to find out what it means to have dementia," said Mr Dajani. The other finalists included two plans to help people understand their carbon footprint, a website to help track whale sightings around the UK and an anti-bullying site.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/technology/6700691.stm to create less clumsy robots 29 May 2007, 13:19 GMT 14:19 to create less clumsy robots The robot being developed by the German Aerospace Centre The race to create more human-like robots stepped up a gear this week as scientists in Spain set about building an artificial cerebellum. The end-game of the two-year project is to implant the man-made cerebellum in a robot to make movements and interaction with humans more natural. The cerebellum is the part of the brain that controls motor functions. Researchers hope that the work might also yield clues to treat cognitive diseases such as Parkinson's. The research, being undertaken at the Department of Architecture and Computing Technology at the University of Granada, is part of a wider European project dubbed Sensopac Sensopac brings together electronic engineers, physicists and neuroscientists from a range of universities including Edinburgh, Israel and Paris with groups such as the German Aerospace Centre. It has 6.5m euros of funding from the European Commission. Its target is to incorporate the cerebellum into a robot designed by the German Aerospace Centre in two year's time. The work at the University of Granada is concentrating on the design of microchips that incorporate a full neuronal system, emulating the way the cerebellum interacts with the human nervous system. Implanting the man-made cerebellum in a robot would allow it to manipulate and interact with other objects with far greater subtlety than industrial robots can currently manage, said researcher Professor Eduardo Ros Vidal, who is co-ordinating work at the University of Granada. "Although robots are increasingly more important to our society and have more advanced technology, they cannot yet do certain tasks like those carried out by mammals," he said. "We have been talking about humanoids for years but we do not yet see them on the street or use the unlimited possibilities they offer us," he added. One use of such robots would be as home-helps for disabled people. The aim is robots with a subtle touch The next stage of the Sensopac project is to develop an artificial skin for robots, making them look more human-like as well as being information-sensitive in the same way as human skin is. This system is being developed by the German Aerospace Centre in collaboration with other research groups. The ambitious project is just one of many attempts to create more human-like robots. Another European research project - dubbed Feelix Growing - has been given 2.3m euros to develop robots that can learn from humans and respond socially and emotionally. The medical community is making huge strides in the use of man-made parts for failures in the human brain. Last year US scientists implanted a sensor in a paralysed man's brain that has enabled him to control objects by using his thoughts alone. The fast pace of current robotics research has prompted deeper questions about how androids would be integrated into human society. Some have called for a code of ethics for robots while others question how humans will cope in the face of machine intelligence. future poses hard questions 24 Apr age poses ethical dilemma 07 Mar of the consumer robots 11 Jan could demand legal rights 21 Dec 06 | Technology Introducing humans version 2.0 24 Oct 06 | Technology
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6703249.stm | Microsoft unveils table computer 30 May 2007, 08:07 GMT 09:07 unveils table computer The computer does away with the need for a keyboard Microsoft has unveiled a new touch-sensitive coffee table-shaped computer called "Surface". Designed to do away with the need for a traditional mouse and keyboard, users can instead use their fingers to operate the computer. Also designed to interact with mobile phones placed on the surface, Microsoft says it will initially sell the unit to corporate customers. These will include hotels, casinos, phone stores and restaurants. So-called "multi-touch" interfaces - which allow the user to move several fingers on a screen to manipulate data, rather than relying on a mouse and menus - have been making waves in tech circles for some time. We envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer One of the most hotly-awaited examples is Apple's iPhone, which is scheduled to be released in June. Hewlett-Packard has also been looking at expanding multi-touch technology, in addition to leading research scientists such as Jeff Han of New York University's Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. With a 30-inch screen, Surface will initially sell for between $5,000 and $10,000 (£2,525-£5,050). However, Microsoft said it aimed to produce cheaper versions for homes within three to five years. "We see this as a multi-billion dollar category, and we envision a time when surface computing technologies will be pervasive, from tabletops and counters to the hallway mirror," said Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer. Microsoft says small groups of people will each Surface machine simultaneously. They will be first deployed in November in Sheraton hotels, Harrah's casinos, T-Mobile stores, and numerous restaurants. The computer giant has had a mixed record recently with new consumer products. While its Xbox games console has been a success, its Zune music player continues to lag far behind Apple's iPod.

The deal means eBay will get access to almost 2.5 million registered users, who recommend sites to each other. Users get search results that are based on their profiles, which the site says gives them more relevant results than a regular search engine. EBay had $3.5bn in cash last month and has been on an acquisition spree buying firms such as Shopping.com and StubHub. StumbleUpon was founded in 2001 by three Canadian software engineers in Calgary. It is free for users and generates revenue through advertising, although users may pay an annual fee to avoid seeing any adverts.
