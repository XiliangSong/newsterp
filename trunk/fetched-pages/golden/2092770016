AM PDT AM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Brandy and a man who was hurt in a deadly freeway crash involving her Range Rover are suing each other. Brandy, whose real name is Brandy Norwood, and Mallory Ham of Simi Valley accuse each other of negligence in lawsuits filed last week in Superior Court. In court papers filed Wednesday, the 28-year-old singer-actress contends that Ham caused the Dec. 30 crash on the San Diego Freeway in Sherman Oaks. She also denies allegations made against her in a previous lawsuit, asserts her Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination and requests a jury trial. Ham's lawsuit, filed Friday, contends Brandy drove recklessly and seeks unspecified damages. Brandy had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. "She's just responding to pieces of litigation as they come in and doesn't want to comment at this time," Edwin McPherson, an attorney representing Brandy, said Tuesday. A California Highway Patrol report said Brandy's 2007 Range Rover failed to slow in traffic and was doing 65 mph when it struck another car that in turn was hit by Ham's vehicle. The crash killed Awatef Aboudihaj, 38, of Los Angeles. Her husband has sued both Brandy and Ham for reckless driving. Aboudihaj's parents and her two children also have separate lawsuits pending against Brandy. The city attorney's office is still deciding whether to charge Brandy with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter, spokesman Frank Mateljan said Tuesday. If charged and convicted, she could face up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7764357.html Justin Timberlake launches record label in joint venture with Interscope Timberlake launches record label in joint venture with Interscope AM PDT AM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Justin Timberlake, music star and movie star, is aiming to add another glittering line to his resume - star maker. The pop singer will sign artists and release their music through a new record label he's heading that's a joint venture with Universal Music Group's Interscope Geffen A&M label group. "We are all excited about the talent we have to offer already on our roster, and I cannot wait to introduce the world to my new discoveries," Timberlake said in a statement issued Monday. Timberlake will serve as chairman and chief executive of the new label, dubbed Tennman Records, which will be based in Los Angeles and distributed globally by Interscope. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Day-to-day operations will be handled by Ken Komisar, a former vice president at Sony BMG Music Entertainment, who was named president at Tennman. Timberlake's first two solo albums - 2002's "Justified" and last year's "FutureSex/LoveSounds" - have sold more than 13 million copies combined. He's currently on the big screen, at least his voice is, in the mega-hit "Shrek the Third."
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7745457.html Hilarious 'Knocked Up' finds balance of raunchy and sweet 'Knocked Up' finds balance of raunchy and sweet AM PDT AM PDT By CHRISTY LEMIRE, AP Film Critic Everything you've heard about "Knocked Up" is true: It's even more riotously and consistently hilarious than its predecessor, Judd Apatow's 2005 sleeper hit "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," with even greater heart. No small feat. As writer and director, Apatow has the rare ability to find just the right tone all the time - a bold yet delicate balance of humor that's raunchy without being mean, sweet without being saccharine. "Knocked Up" also features a cavalcade of pop culture references that never feel gratuitous, as well as some in-jokes that never seem smug. Here's how good Apatow is: He even manages to make Ryan Seacrest funny, in one spectacular scene in which the "American Idol" host takes a sledgehammer to his self-important image. Seth Rogen, who we already knew was funny from his scene-stealing performance in "Virgin," emerges as an unlikely but likable leading man as Ben Stone, a goofball of a slacker-stoner who enjoys a drunken romp with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl from "Grey's Anatomy" showing an unexpected knack for comedy), an up-and-coming entertainment reporter who's way out of his league. Eight weeks later, she realizes she's pregnant - and, to borrow from Madonna, she's made up her mind, she's keeping her baby - forcing both of them to make major changes in their lives. (The fact that Apatow approaches the idea of abortion and lets his characters ponder it before Alison chooses to have the child, without entering into any sort of heavy-handed moral or political debate, is just one more example of his assured touch.) Clearly these people are totally wrong for each other. Ben is round and hairy; Alison is leggy and blonde. He sits around all day with his equally unmotivated buddies, working on a Web site that lists the exact moment when actresses get naked in movies; she wakes up early, spends time with her family and takes her job seriously at E! Entertainment Television. But they must get to know each other, first as friends and then possibly as something deeper, if they're going to make this work. It doesn't exactly help that their primary example is Alison's older sister Debbie (Apatow's radiant wife, Leslie Mann) and her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd, always a subtle comic talent), who don't have much in common anymore besides their two kids. On Ben's side, there's even less help. The friends with whom he shares a tract house in the San Fernando Valley (Jason Segel, Jonah Hill, Martin Starr and Jay Baruchel, all old pals from "Virgin" and Apatow's short-lived TV shows "Freaks and Geeks" and "Undeclared") say they support him but they'd have no idea what to do with a baby, and they're too high all the time to figure it out. This description, of course, makes these guys sounds useless and paints them into a corner as overly familiar types. But one of the best aspects of Apatow's script is that he makes his characters feel incredibly real. These are people who love movies and television and pop culture, and their analytical discussions of these topics always sound completely genuine. You may not get all the jokes - references to "Murderball" and Matisyahu play differently in different cities - but you'll laugh hard enough and often enough to want to go back a second time and catch the lines you missed. When they tool on each other - which they do constantly - you know it's with affection, and Apatow obviously has great affection for them, too. Much of their banter was improvised, and Heigl, in a rare leading film role, steps confidently and easily into this male-dork-dominated society. It would be easy to write her off as eye candy, playing the straight woman amid a bevy of actors who get far showier roles, but she very much holds her own. "Knocked Up" starts out with a one-night stand, but in the end it turns out to be a movie about loyalty. And except for being a bit on the long side - which you won't mind because you'll be having too much fun - it's pretty close to perfect. "Knocked Up," a Universal Pictures release, is rated R for sexual content, drug use and language. Running time: 129 minutes. Four stars out of four.

http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7730077.html Britney Spears weighs in on rehab, tabloids Spears weighs in on rehab, tabloids May 29, 2007 at 12:15 PM PDT May 29, 2007 at 5:30 PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Britney Spears says she "hit rock bottom," in a message posted on her Web site about the end of her marriage and her time in rehab. Spears calls rehab "a very humbling place" and denies that it was alcohol or depression that sent her there. "I truly hit rock bottom," the 25-year-old pop star writes. "I was like a bad kid running around with ADD." Spears completed a monthlong stay at a luxury Malibu rehabilitation treatment facility in March after a series of run-ins with the paparazzi that included a stop at a San Fernando Valley hair salon, where she was caught on video shearing her own locks. Other photos splashed across the Internet appeared to reveal Spears out partying wearing nothing underneath her short skirts. She was seen going out with Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan after filing for divorce from aspiring rapper Kevin Federline last November, just two months after giving birth to their second child, Jayden James. The pair also have an older son, Sean Preston, now 20 months. The couple reached a divorce settlement in March. "I had a manager from a long time ago come in and try to direct me and my life after I got my divorce," writes Spears. "I was so overwhelmed I think that I was in a little shock too. I didn't know who to go to." "I realized how much energy and love I had put into my past relationship when it was gone because I genuinely did not know what to do with myself, and it made me so sad. I confess, I was so lost," she writes. Explaining her recent behavior, she says: "I think it is actually normal for a young girl to go out after a huge divorce." Spears also says she is "having to face a lot of things" as she raises her two young sons. "A lot of insecurities from when I was little are coming up again," she writes. "It is like we are never good enough." But Spears says she's no longer "angry at the tabloids," and now tries to "be numb to what I see." "I am going to make mistakes everyday, and I am sure every mistake I make will probably be on CNN or `Good Morning America,"' she writes. "I am only human people and I love you for still loving me." She closes by saying, "We will never really understand or figure out life completely. That's God's job. I can't wait to meet him ... or her. Love, Britney."
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7764512.html Competition narrows to 59 in national spelling bee narrows to 59 in national spelling bee Kennyi Aouad, 11, bursts into laughter when asked to spell the word, "Sardoodledom," during the Scripps National Spelling Bee. AM PDT AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - For most kids, the appearance of the word "Bewusstseinslage" on any kind of test would be reason to shriek in horror. For Matthew Evans, it was cause for joy. "My favorite word!" said the 12-year-old boy from Albuquerque, N.M. The 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee began by reducing the record field of 286 spellers to 59 on Wednesday. Those who survived will return for the semifinals and finals Thursday, and the champion will be crowned on prime-time national television. Most of the winnowing was done with a 25-word multiple-choice test, followed by three oral rounds that featured a display of confidence, nervousness and befuddlement - not to mention sheer relief when a guess proved correct. "Yes!" exclaimed 12-year-old Tia Thomas of Coarsegold, Calif., who pumped her fists and skipped back to her seat after correctly spelling "periostracum" (the hard covering of a mollusk shell). "I was pretty sure I knew the word," Tia said. "But the 'peri' part was guessing." Matthew and Tia, both in the national bee for the fourth time, are two of the favorites to become the champion. The winner receives $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. Achieving that goal will require outlasting 13-year-old Samir Patel of Colleyville, Texas, who is back for the fifth year after placing third, 27th, second and 14th. With his grandfather from India - visiting the United States for the first time - sitting on the front row, Samir breezed through "decor" in the preliminary round, and "trumpery" (of low quality) and "sunglo" (a green Chinese tea) in the quarterfinals. "I'm a lot more prepared than I was the first year," Samir said. "I'm not as nervous, and I already know sort of the routine, so I'm not so much worried about 'Am I going to be there on time?' 'Am I going to make a mistake in walking down the stage?"' Far removed from the glamour of the rounds that will be televised on ESPN and ABC on Thursday, the bee started early in the morning in a setting that more closely resembled a classroom of students taking the SAT. Spellers from English-speaking parts of the world filled in ovals with their No. 2 pencils during the multiple-choice test, which included words ranging from "icicle" to "ylem" (a hypothetical substance from the early universe). Matthew was happily surprised when he saw that the 25th word was Bewusstseinslage (a state of consciousness, pronounced bay-VOOHST-sines-lahg-eh), which he likes "just because it's so weird-sounding." "I was like, 'Oh my goodness. Wow! This is awesome,"' said Matthew, who got 24 of 25 correct. Then all of the spellers were given their only guaranteed moment on the Grand Hyatt's ballroom stage: a chance to spell one word before the audience of parents, friends and judges. "Macaroni - what does it mean?" asked 14-year-old Michael Yeh of Kokomo, Ind., exercising his right to ask for a definition before correctly spelling the popular food. The multiple choice test (worth 25 points) and the preliminary oral round (worth three points) narrowed the field to 107. Thirteen more were eliminated in the next round, and 35 heard the telltale bell signaling an incorrect response in the day's final round. Every year there are spellers who have their own quirks to help them stay focused. This year, some wrote letters in the air, others on their hands. Jonathan Horton, 14, of Gilbert, Ariz., who finished in a tie for sixth last year, has developed a rhythm in which he turns his head and appears to feign a cough several times while spelling a word. He did it four times while working through the 10 letters of "exhilarate." "I say a couple of letters into my hand, and then I say them out loud," said Jonathan, who also advanced to the semifinals. "I do that because I don't want to say the wrong letter out loud." Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever by correctly spelling "enumerated" in the preliminaries, but she was stumped by "coadunation" (union of a large body) in the quarterfinals. Kennyi Aouad, 11, of Terre Haute, Ind., became a crowd favorite after he couldn't stop laughing when he was given the funky-sounding word "Sardoodledom" (a melodramatic plot). He finally composed himself and asked all sorts of questions about the word - definition, part of speech, alternate pronunciations, use in a sentence - then tried to get an unallowable hint by asking: "Is it kind of like kingdom?" He could hardly believe it when he spelled the word correctly.
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7734982.html Lohan checks into rehab after weekend crash and DUI arrest checks into rehab after weekend crash and DUI arrest May 29, 2007 at 4:30 PM PDT May 29, 2007 at 4:30 PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Lindsay Lohan has checked into rehab. The move followed a weekend during which the wild-child actress crashed her Mercedes, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence and was photographed closed-eyed and slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car. The 20-year-old "admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility" on Monday, according to a statement released by her publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnick. The statement added, "Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation and respect the privacy of Lindsay as well as the other patients receiving treatment at the facility." This is Lohan's second rehab stint this year. She said in January that she had checked into a rehabilitation center for substance abuse treatment. "It's so weird that I went to rehab," Lohan said in Allure magazine's May issue. "I always said I would die before I went to rehab." Lohan was arrested Saturday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence after her car hopped a curb and hit a shrub on Sunset Boulevard. Witnesses called police, who arrived to find both Lohan and the vehicle missing from the accident site, said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Mitch McCann. "We tracked down the vehicle to a nearby apartment complex and tracked down Ms. Lohan to a Century City hospital," he said Tuesday. Officers investigating the crash also found a substance tentatively identified as cocaine. The case remains under investigation, McCann said. Lohan could face additional charges for leaving the scene, he said, adding "we would take into consideration that she was injured and transported to a hospital." Her preliminary court date is scheduled for Aug. 24. She will be represented by attorneys Blair Berk and Jason Sloane. Neither returned calls for comment Tuesday. Lohan was back out on the town before the Memorial Day weekend was over. Photographers captured her slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car early Monday morning. The photos, posted online, show a sweatshirt-clad Lohan with her mouth open and her eyes shut, apparently asleep. "The world has been very hard on her," said Michael Heller, an attorney and Lohan family friend. "She has a lot of personal issues and family issues. There's an incredible amount of pressure on this 20-year-old." He also noted on Tuesday that Lohan has "gone from one movie to the next," spending long stretches of time away from her family. "She's living in a hotel," he said. "It's a very lonely existence." Lohan's mother, Dina Lohan, told Us Weekly magazine earlier this month that when her daughter isn't working, "she's so bored." "I've told her, `Please slow down. Stop!' She's growing up and learning to do that. She really loves the business," the mother said. Lohan was originally set to begin work this week on "Poor Things," a comedy starring Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Rosario Dawson and Channing Tatum, the trade paper Variety reported Monday. The company behind the project, Still Rolling Productions, did not return calls or e-mails from The Associated Press Tuesday. Lohan did her first movie at age 11: Disney's remake of "The Parent Trap." Her breakout role came in 2004's "Mean Girls." She released her debut album that same year. Her other screen credits include "Freaky Friday," "Bobby" and "A Prairie Home Companion." Her most recent movie, "Georgia Rule," is in theaters now. During its production last summer, one of the film's producers chastised Lohan for her "various late arrivals and absences from the set." "We are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called `exhaustion,"' James G. Robinson wrote in a letter made public in July 2006. Lohan will turn 21 on July 2. "This is a time when she will reflect backwards and think forward," Heller said. "Hopefully she will plan a future that will be fruitful artistically, professionally (and) take a place in society that will be appropriate for someone of her standing."

The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, sold for $192,000 to a private European buyer at Christie's sale of film and entertainment memorabilia. The iconic black dress she also wore in the film sold for more than $800,000 last year at London auction. Christie's said it had expected the pink dress to sell for as much as $30,000. "The sale was filled with iconic pieces," said Helen Hall, Christie's head of entertainment memorabilia. "It captured people's imagination." Hall said the auction house was pleased with the results of the sale, which brought in $1.2 million. Other items on the block included Marilyn Monroe's script for "Something's Got To Give," with the actress' handwritten notes, which sold for $19,200. A program from President John F. Kennedy's birthday celebration that featured the actress at Madison Square Garden went for $66,000. All the prices include the Christie's commission.
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7756047.html Michael Lohan says Lindsey is hooked on alcohol and OxyContin Lohan says Lindsey is hooked on alcohol and OxyContin PM PDT PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Lindsay Lohan's estranged father says she suffers from multiple addictions, including alcohol and the painkiller OxyContin, the Web site E! Online reported Wednesday. The 20-year-old actress checked into rehab Monday following a weekend that included crashing her Mercedes, being arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence and being photographed slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car. This is her second rehab stint this year. "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay, because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care," Michael Lohan told E! Online. "And I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things. That's a very important step." Lindsay Lohan's publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, did not immediately return an after-hours call and e-mail from The Associated Press on Wednesday. Michael Lohan was released from a New York state prison in March after serving almost two years for driving while intoxicated and other charges. He said he is studying to become a drug-rehab counselor with the faith-based organization Teen Challenge. Before entering rehab, the actress was scheduled to start work this week on "Poor Things," a comedy featuring Shirley MacLaine, who is also a producer on the movie. MacLaine and co-producer Rob Hickman said in a statement Wednesday that Lohan still wants to work on the project. "We are trying to rearrange the shooting schedule to facilitate her working at the end of the shoot to coincide with the completion of her rehabilitation," the statement said. In other events swirling around Lohan, who turns 21 on July 2, authorities who have been conducting undercover operations at trendy celebrity watering holes in recent weeks are seeking to find out if she was served alcohol before her weekend car crash. California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control investigators also want to know if Lohan or others were served after hours, agency spokesman John Carr said. Videos show Lohan leaving Hollywood's Les Deux club at 3:30 a.m. Alcohol cannot be served in California after 2 a.m. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control told the Beverly Hills Police Department it wants to review witness reports and other evidence to determine if a formal investigation is warranted, Carr said. Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore said in a statement that Lohan stayed late having dinner and waiting for friends, and wasn't drinking.

On Tuesday's show, Hasselbeck said she and O'Donnell were "in communication a lot," though Hasselbeck didn't say whether they had talked on the phone or exchanged e-mails. Their confrontation last Wednesday led to O'Donnell's early departure from the daytime chatfest. "This weekend gave us the opportunity to tackle our most important Hot Topic yet, and that was the power of forgiveness, and I believe that we've begun that process," Hasselbeck said. "And so now that enables us to move on in a very positive way. ... I'm really happy about that." Show creator and co-host Barbara Walters said Tuesday she had been sending e-mails to O'Donnell and they remain "close friends." Walters also said O'Donnell is welcome back to "The View" as a panelist at anytime. The argument between Hasselbeck and O'Donnell began over O'Donnell's earlier statement about the war: "655,000 Iraqi civilians had died. Who are the terrorists?" Talk-show critics accused O'Donnell of calling U.S. troops terrorists. She called Hasselbeck "cowardly" for not saying anything in response to the critics, which set off their lengthy argument. On Friday, ABC said O'Donnell asked for, and received, an early exit from her contract. O'Donnell said last month she would be leaving because she couldn't agree to a new contract with ABC executives. In a video blog posted Saturday on her Web site, O'Donnell said she didn't think she and Hasselbeck would ever speak again. "I haven't spoken to her, and I probably won't, and I think it's just as well," O'Donnell said. "I wrote her an e-mail, and she wrote me back, and there you have it." O'Donnell also said she never really fit in on the show.
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7756132.html Fred Thompson, weighing presidential bid, will leave 'Law & Order' Thompson, weighing presidential bid, will leave 'Law & Order' PM PDT PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fred Thompson, edging toward a presidential run, is giving up his day job playing a prosecutor on the TV series "Law & Order." Thompson asked Wednesday to be released from the show after five seasons, series creator and executive producer Dick Wolf said. "Although he told me he has not made a firm decision about his political future, he felt that given the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season," he should leave "Law & Order," Wolf said in a statement. The producer lauded Thompson's commitment to "Law & Order" and the new TV movie "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee," in which the actor plays a president - Ulysses S. Grant. The film, which Wolf produced, premiered last Sunday on HBO. Thompson, 64, a former U.S. senator from Tennessee, has yet to announce he's seeking the GOP nomination but has taken steps toward a summer entry into the crowded field. He has been casting himself in speeches and on the Internet as a Reaganesque conservative. Thompson, a lawyer, began his acting career with the film "Marie" in 1985, about a high-profile legal case he handled in Tennessee and in which he played himself. His credits also include "In the Line of Fire" and "The Hunt for Red October." Thompson served in the Senate from 1994 to 2002, resuming his Hollywood career when he left. On NBC's "Law & Order," which has been renewed for its 18th year, he played New York District Attorney Arthur Branch. sparks chaos with reckless U-turns

No small feat. As writer and director, Apatow has the rare ability to find just the right tone all the time - a bold yet delicate balance of humor that's raunchy without being mean, sweet without being saccharine. "Knocked Up" also features a cavalcade of pop culture references that never feel gratuitous, as well as some in-jokes that never seem smug. Here's how good Apatow is: He even manages to make Ryan Seacrest funny, in one spectacular scene in which the "American Idol" host takes a sledgehammer to his self-important image. Seth Rogen, who we already knew was funny from his scene-stealing performance in "Virgin," emerges as an unlikely but likable leading man as Ben Stone, a goofball of a slacker-stoner who enjoys a drunken romp with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl from "Grey's Anatomy" showing an unexpected knack for comedy), an up-and-coming entertainment reporter who's way out of his league. Eight weeks later, she realizes she's pregnant - and, to borrow from Madonna, she's made up her mind, she's keeping her baby - forcing both of them to make major changes in their lives. (The fact that Apatow approaches the idea of abortion and lets his characters ponder it before Alison chooses to have the child, without entering into any sort of heavy-handed moral or political debate, is just one more example of his assured touch.) Clearly these people are totally wrong for each other. Ben is round and hairy; Alison is leggy and blonde. He sits around all day with his equally unmotivated buddies, working on a Web site that lists the exact moment when actresses get naked in movies; she wakes up early, spends time with her family and takes her job seriously at E! Entertainment Television. But they must get to know each other, first as friends and then possibly as something deeper, if they're going to make this work. It doesn't exactly help that their primary example is Alison's older sister Debbie (Apatow's radiant wife, Leslie Mann) and her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd, always a subtle comic talent), who don't have much in common anymore besides their two kids. On Ben's side, there's even less help. The friends with whom he shares a tract house in the San Fernando Valley (Jason Segel, Jonah Hill, Martin Starr and Jay Baruchel, all old pals from "Virgin" and Apatow's short-lived TV shows "Freaks and Geeks" and "Undeclared") say they support him but they'd have no idea what to do with a baby, and they're too high all the time to figure it out. This description, of course, makes these guys sounds useless and paints them into a corner as overly familiar types. But one of the best aspects of Apatow's script is that he makes his characters feel incredibly real. These are people who love movies and television and pop culture, and their analytical discussions of these topics always sound completely genuine. You may not get all the jokes - references to "Murderball" and Matisyahu play differently in different cities - but you'll laugh hard enough and often enough to want to go back a second time and catch the lines you missed. When they tool on each other - which they do constantly - you know it's with affection, and Apatow obviously has great affection for them, too. Much of their banter was improvised, and Heigl, in a rare leading film role, steps confidently and easily into this male-dork-dominated society. It would be easy to write her off as eye candy, playing the straight woman amid a bevy of actors who get far showier roles, but she very much holds her own. "Knocked Up" starts out with a one-night stand, but in the end it turns out to be a movie about loyalty. And except for being a bit on the long side - which you won't mind because you'll be having too much fun - it's pretty close to perfect. "Knocked Up," a Universal Pictures release, is rated R for sexual content, drug use and language. Running time: 129 minutes.

http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7764512.html Competition narrows to 59 in national spelling bee narrows to 59 in national spelling bee Kennyi Aouad, 11, bursts into laughter when asked to spell the word, "Sardoodledom," during the Scripps National Spelling Bee. AM PDT AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - For most kids, the appearance of the word "Bewusstseinslage" on any kind of test would be reason to shriek in horror. For Matthew Evans, it was cause for joy. "My favorite word!" said the 12-year-old boy from Albuquerque, N.M. The 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee began by reducing the record field of 286 spellers to 59 on Wednesday. Those who survived will return for the semifinals and finals Thursday, and the champion will be crowned on prime-time national television. Most of the winnowing was done with a 25-word multiple-choice test, followed by three oral rounds that featured a display of confidence, nervousness and befuddlement - not to mention sheer relief when a guess proved correct. "Yes!" exclaimed 12-year-old Tia Thomas of Coarsegold, Calif., who pumped her fists and skipped back to her seat after correctly spelling "periostracum" (the hard covering of a mollusk shell). "I was pretty sure I knew the word," Tia said. "But the 'peri' part was guessing." Matthew and Tia, both in the national bee for the fourth time, are two of the favorites to become the champion. The winner receives $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. Achieving that goal will require outlasting 13-year-old Samir Patel of Colleyville, Texas, who is back for the fifth year after placing third, 27th, second and 14th. With his grandfather from India - visiting the United States for the first time - sitting on the front row, Samir breezed through "decor" in the preliminary round, and "trumpery" (of low quality) and "sunglo" (a green Chinese tea) in the quarterfinals. "I'm a lot more prepared than I was the first year," Samir said. "I'm not as nervous, and I already know sort of the routine, so I'm not so much worried about 'Am I going to be there on time?' 'Am I going to make a mistake in walking down the stage?"' Far removed from the glamour of the rounds that will be televised on ESPN and ABC on Thursday, the bee started early in the morning in a setting that more closely resembled a classroom of students taking the SAT. Spellers from English-speaking parts of the world filled in ovals with their No. 2 pencils during the multiple-choice test, which included words ranging from "icicle" to "ylem" (a hypothetical substance from the early universe). Matthew was happily surprised when he saw that the 25th word was Bewusstseinslage (a state of consciousness, pronounced bay-VOOHST-sines-lahg-eh), which he likes "just because it's so weird-sounding." "I was like, 'Oh my goodness. Wow! This is awesome,"' said Matthew, who got 24 of 25 correct. Then all of the spellers were given their only guaranteed moment on the Grand Hyatt's ballroom stage: a chance to spell one word before the audience of parents, friends and judges. "Macaroni - what does it mean?" asked 14-year-old Michael Yeh of Kokomo, Ind., exercising his right to ask for a definition before correctly spelling the popular food. The multiple choice test (worth 25 points) and the preliminary oral round (worth three points) narrowed the field to 107. Thirteen more were eliminated in the next round, and 35 heard the telltale bell signaling an incorrect response in the day's final round. Every year there are spellers who have their own quirks to help them stay focused. This year, some wrote letters in the air, others on their hands. Jonathan Horton, 14, of Gilbert, Ariz., who finished in a tie for sixth last year, has developed a rhythm in which he turns his head and appears to feign a cough several times while spelling a word. He did it four times while working through the 10 letters of "exhilarate." "I say a couple of letters into my hand, and then I say them out loud," said Jonathan, who also advanced to the semifinals. "I do that because I don't want to say the wrong letter out loud." Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever by correctly spelling "enumerated" in the preliminaries, but she was stumped by "coadunation" (union of a large body) in the quarterfinals. Kennyi Aouad, 11, of Terre Haute, Ind., became a crowd favorite after he couldn't stop laughing when he was given the funky-sounding word "Sardoodledom" (a melodramatic plot). He finally composed himself and asked all sorts of questions about the word - definition, part of speech, alternate pronunciations, use in a sentence - then tried to get an unallowable hint by asking: "Is it kind of like kingdom?" He could hardly believe it when he spelled the word correctly. sitter accused of raping baby boy The Schrammie: Michael Schreck, time to fess up Two dead in Eatonville crash Police: 'Missing' naval officer not missing Microsoft shows off 'coffee table of the future' Ken Schram: I'm sorry School evacuated after plumber finds body in air conditioning duct Miss USA booed at Miss Universe pageant Rosie O'Donnell says she may never speak to Elisabeth Hasselbeck again 'King of spam' arrested in Seattle
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7734982.html Lohan checks into rehab after weekend crash and DUI arrest checks into rehab after weekend crash and DUI arrest May 29, 2007 at 4:30 PM PDT May 29, 2007 at 4:30 PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Lindsay Lohan has checked into rehab. The move followed a weekend during which the wild-child actress crashed her Mercedes, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence and was photographed closed-eyed and slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car. The 20-year-old "admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility" on Monday, according to a statement released by her publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnick. The statement added, "Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation and respect the privacy of Lindsay as well as the other patients receiving treatment at the facility." This is Lohan's second rehab stint this year. She said in January that she had checked into a rehabilitation center for substance abuse treatment. "It's so weird that I went to rehab," Lohan said in Allure magazine's May issue. "I always said I would die before I went to rehab." Lohan was arrested Saturday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence after her car hopped a curb and hit a shrub on Sunset Boulevard. Witnesses called police, who arrived to find both Lohan and the vehicle missing from the accident site, said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Mitch McCann. "We tracked down the vehicle to a nearby apartment complex and tracked down Ms. Lohan to a Century City hospital," he said Tuesday. Officers investigating the crash also found a substance tentatively identified as cocaine. The case remains under investigation, McCann said. Lohan could face additional charges for leaving the scene, he said, adding "we would take into consideration that she was injured and transported to a hospital." Her preliminary court date is scheduled for Aug. 24. She will be represented by attorneys Blair Berk and Jason Sloane. Neither returned calls for comment Tuesday. Lohan was back out on the town before the Memorial Day weekend was over. Photographers captured her slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car early Monday morning. The photos, posted online, show a sweatshirt-clad Lohan with her mouth open and her eyes shut, apparently asleep. "The world has been very hard on her," said Michael Heller, an attorney and Lohan family friend. "She has a lot of personal issues and family issues. There's an incredible amount of pressure on this 20-year-old." He also noted on Tuesday that Lohan has "gone from one movie to the next," spending long stretches of time away from her family. "She's living in a hotel," he said. "It's a very lonely existence." Lohan's mother, Dina Lohan, told Us Weekly magazine earlier this month that when her daughter isn't working, "she's so bored." "I've told her, `Please slow down. Stop!' She's growing up and learning to do that. She really loves the business," the mother said. Lohan was originally set to begin work this week on "Poor Things," a comedy starring Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Rosario Dawson and Channing Tatum, the trade paper Variety reported Monday. The company behind the project, Still Rolling Productions, did not return calls or e-mails from The Associated Press Tuesday. Lohan did her first movie at age 11: Disney's remake of "The Parent Trap." Her breakout role came in 2004's "Mean Girls." She released her debut album that same year. Her other screen credits include "Freaky Friday," "Bobby" and "A Prairie Home Companion." Her most recent movie, "Georgia Rule," is in theaters now. During its production last summer, one of the film's producers chastised Lohan for her "various late arrivals and absences from the set." "We are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called `exhaustion,"' James G. Robinson wrote in a letter made public in July 2006. Lohan will turn 21 on July 2. "This is a time when she will reflect backwards and think forward," Heller said. "Hopefully she will plan a future that will be fruitful artistically, professionally (and) take a place in society that will be appropriate for someone of her standing." sitter accused of raping baby boy The Schrammie: Michael Schreck, time to fess up Two dead in Eatonville crash Police: 'Missing' naval officer not missing Microsoft shows off 'coffee table of the future' Ken Schram: I'm sorry School evacuated after plumber finds body in air conditioning duct Miss USA booed at Miss Universe pageant Rosie O'Donnell says she may never speak to Elisabeth Hasselbeck again 'King of spam' arrested in Seattle

The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, sold for $192,000 to a private European buyer at Christie's sale of film and entertainment memorabilia. The iconic black dress she also wore in the film sold for more than $800,000 last year at London auction. Christie's said it had expected the pink dress to sell for as much as $30,000. "The sale was filled with iconic pieces," said Helen Hall, Christie's head of entertainment memorabilia. "It captured people's imagination." Hall said the auction house was pleased with the results of the sale, which brought in $1.2 million. Other items on the block included Marilyn Monroe's script for "Something's Got To Give," with the actress' handwritten notes, which sold for $19,200. A program from President John F. Kennedy's birthday celebration that featured the actress at Madison Square Garden went for $66,000. All the prices include the Christie's commission. sitter accused of raping baby boy The Schrammie: Michael Schreck, time to fess up Two dead in Eatonville crash Police: 'Missing' naval officer not missing Microsoft shows off 'coffee table of the future' Ken Schram: I'm sorry School evacuated after plumber finds body in air conditioning duct Miss USA booed at Miss Universe pageant Rosie O'Donnell says she may never speak to Elisabeth Hasselbeck again 'King of spam' arrested in Seattle
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7756047.html Michael Lohan says Lindsey is hooked on alcohol and OxyContin Lohan says Lindsey is hooked on alcohol and OxyContin May 30, 2007 at 6:09 PM PDT May 30, 2007 at 6:10 PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Lindsay Lohan's estranged father says she suffers from multiple addictions, including alcohol and the painkiller OxyContin, the Web site E! Online reported Wednesday. The 20-year-old actress checked into rehab Monday following a weekend that included crashing her Mercedes, being arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence and being photographed slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car. This is her second rehab stint this year. "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay, because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care," Michael Lohan told E! Online. "And I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things. That's a very important step." Lindsay Lohan's publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, did not immediately return an after-hours call and e-mail from The Associated Press on Wednesday. Michael Lohan was released from a New York state prison in March after serving almost two years for driving while intoxicated and other charges. He said he is studying to become a drug-rehab counselor with the faith-based organization Teen Challenge. Before entering rehab, the actress was scheduled to start work this week on "Poor Things," a comedy featuring Shirley MacLaine, who is also a producer on the movie. MacLaine and co-producer Rob Hickman said in a statement Wednesday that Lohan still wants to work on the project. "We are trying to rearrange the shooting schedule to facilitate her working at the end of the shoot to coincide with the completion of her rehabilitation," the statement said. In other events swirling around Lohan, who turns 21 on July 2, authorities who have been conducting undercover operations at trendy celebrity watering holes in recent weeks are seeking to find out if she was served alcohol before her weekend car crash. California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control investigators also want to know if Lohan or others were served after hours, agency spokesman John Carr said. Videos show Lohan leaving Hollywood's Les Deux club at 3:30 a.m. Alcohol cannot be served in California after 2 a.m. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control told the Beverly Hills Police Department it wants to review witness reports and other evidence to determine if a formal investigation is warranted, Carr said. Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore said in a statement that Lohan stayed late having dinner and waiting for friends, and wasn't drinking. sitter accused of raping baby boy The Schrammie: Michael Schreck, time to fess up Two dead in Eatonville crash Police: 'Missing' naval officer not missing Microsoft shows off 'coffee table of the future' Ken Schram: I'm sorry School evacuated after plumber finds body in air conditioning duct Miss USA booed at Miss Universe pageant Rosie O'Donnell says she may never speak to Elisabeth Hasselbeck again 'King of spam' arrested in Seattle

On Tuesday's show, Hasselbeck said she and O'Donnell were "in communication a lot," though Hasselbeck didn't say whether they had talked on the phone or exchanged e-mails. Their confrontation last Wednesday led to O'Donnell's early departure from the daytime chatfest. "This weekend gave us the opportunity to tackle our most important Hot Topic yet, and that was the power of forgiveness, and I believe that we've begun that process," Hasselbeck said. "And so now that enables us to move on in a very positive way. ... I'm really happy about that." Show creator and co-host Barbara Walters said Tuesday she had been sending e-mails to O'Donnell and they remain "close friends." Walters also said O'Donnell is welcome back to "The View" as a panelist at anytime. The argument between Hasselbeck and O'Donnell began over O'Donnell's earlier statement about the war: "655,000 Iraqi civilians had died. Who are the terrorists?" Talk-show critics accused O'Donnell of calling U.S. troops terrorists. She called Hasselbeck "cowardly" for not saying anything in response to the critics, which set off their lengthy argument. On Friday, ABC said O'Donnell asked for, and received, an early exit from her contract. O'Donnell said last month she would be leaving because she couldn't agree to a new contract with ABC executives. In a video blog posted Saturday on her Web site, O'Donnell said she didn't think she and Hasselbeck would ever speak again. "I haven't spoken to her, and I probably won't, and I think it's just as well," O'Donnell said. "I wrote her an e-mail, and she wrote me back, and there you have it." O'Donnell also said she never really fit in on the show. sitter accused of raping baby boy The Schrammie: Michael Schreck, time to fess up Two dead in Eatonville crash Police: 'Missing' naval officer not missing Microsoft shows off 'coffee table of the future' Ken Schram: I'm sorry School evacuated after plumber finds body in air conditioning duct Miss USA booed at Miss Universe pageant Rosie O'Donnell says she may never speak to Elisabeth Hasselbeck again 'King of spam' arrested in Seattle

Thompson asked Wednesday to be released from the show after five seasons, series creator and executive producer Dick Wolf said. "Although he told me he has not made a firm decision about his political future, he felt that given the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season," he should leave "Law & Order," Wolf said in a statement. The producer lauded Thompson's commitment to "Law & Order" and the new TV movie "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee," in which the actor plays a president - Ulysses S. Grant. The film, which Wolf produced, premiered last Sunday on HBO. Thompson, 64, a former U.S. senator from Tennessee, has yet to announce he's seeking the GOP nomination but has taken steps toward a summer entry into the crowded field. He has been casting himself in speeches and on the Internet as a Reaganesque conservative. Thompson, a lawyer, began his acting career with the film "Marie" in 1985, about a high-profile legal case he handled in Tennessee and in which he played himself. His credits also include "In the Line of Fire" and "The Hunt for Red October." Thompson served in the Senate from 1994 to 2002, resuming his Hollywood career when he left. On NBC's "Law & Order," which has been renewed for its 18th year, he played New York District Attorney Arthur Branch. sitter accused of raping baby boy The Schrammie: Michael Schreck, time to fess up Two dead in Eatonville crash Police: 'Missing' naval officer not missing Microsoft shows off 'coffee table of the future' Ken Schram: I'm sorry School evacuated after plumber finds body in air conditioning duct Miss USA booed at Miss Universe pageant Rosie O'Donnell says she may never speak to Elisabeth Hasselbeck again 'King of spam' arrested in Seattle
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7830142.html Starbucks' music label debuts with new Paul McCartney CD music label debuts with new Paul McCartney CD Jun 4, 2007 at 1:50 PM PDT Jun 4, 2007 at 1:50 PM PDT SEATTLE (AP) - Caffeine junkies who go to Starbucks for their daily fix will get a nonstop dose of Paul McCartney's "Memory Almost Full" on Tuesday as the coffee company's new record label releases its first CD. Starbucks Corp. estimates that some 6 million people will be among the first to hear the new album as they line up for their lattes in more than 10,000 stores in 29 countries, where it will be playing on continuous loop throughout the day. It's a tactic most retailers would not likely attempt "probably for no other reason than not wanting to drive their workers insane," quipped Mike McGuire, an analyst for Gartner Inc. Still, McGuire said Starbucks has proved to be adept at selling music and thinks it's smart for the company to tap into its vast customer base. "Let's face it. The energy has kind of gone out of the CD store launch," McGuire said, "so you've got to go where (consumers) are, which is typically buying coffee at a Starbucks." Ken Lombard, president of Starbucks' entertainment division, said he's not worried about customers or baristas succumbing to McCartney overload. "To the contrary, we think everybody's going to be really excited," he said. Starbucks co-founded its Hear Music label with Concord Music Group in March. McCartney was in the final stages of recording and mastering his latest set of songs when he signed a one-album deal with Hear Music, becoming the label's first artist. "Once we heard the album ... we just knew this was a phenomenal record," Lombard said. "It is the most personal and revealing album that Paul has created in his solo career. ... It's such a reflection of his life and his career, I mean, the ups and downs and the recognition of really what a remarkable journey it has been. So it was really for us the perfect fit." Lombard said he hasn't set any sales targets for "Memory Almost Full" but that he'd be "ecstatic" if it ends up rivaling "Genius Loves Company," an album of Ray Charles duets that Starbucks and Concord co-released in 2004. It won eight Grammy awards the following year and has sold more than 5.5 million copies worldwide. McCartney remains Hear Music's only artist, but Lombard said the label remains on track with previously announced plans to sign two more artists this year and eight next year. Executives remain hopeful that McCartney will sign on for future albums. "The relationship is going very well between us, and it is our hope that Paul is feeling the same way," Lombard said. "When the time is right, we'll talk about what the next steps are going to be beyond this, but right now our focus is doing everything we can to ensure that 'Memory Almost Full' is an extraordinary success." A spokesman for McCartney declined to comment. In addition to playing and selling the album in its stores, Starbucks got XM Satellite Radio Holdings Inc. to play McCartney music exclusively on one of its channels Tuesday, putting "Memory Almost Full" in heavy rotation. Hear Music has also hired crews in London, New York, Berlin, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Seattle, Hong Kong, Tokyo and Miami to film footage of McCartney fans wishing him happy birthday for a video tribute that will be broadcast on Internet social-networking sites, including Google Inc.'s YouTube, Yahoo Inc.'s Yahoo360 and Microsoft Corp.'s Windows Live Spaces, on the artist's 65th birthday June 18. Most labels lean heavily on artist appearances for CD releases, but Lombard said Monday it was not yet clear exactly what McCartney would be doing the day of the release. "Paul likes to work in a way that he comes in and provides a great surprise to his fans and to music consumers, and that's an approach we're all on board with," Lombard said. Hear Music hasn't completely abandoned more traditional marketing methods, but is relying a lot less on advance radio play and music reviews ahead of "Memory Almost Full's" release. The album will be sold at most Starbucks stores worldwide, in all major music retailers, and on Apple Inc.'s iTunes online music store, making it the first of McCartney's 21 solo albums to be released digitally. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder

(Spoiler alert: If you plan to watch Sunday's episode later and don't want a casualty report, stop reading now.) With hostilities boiling between New Jersey capo Tony Soprano and the New York mob, Brooklyn boss Phil Leotardo ordered a hit on Tony, consigliere Silvio Dante and top soldier Bobby Bacala. After getting tipped to the execution order by an FBI agent, Tony declared, "We gotta hit first." Tony summoned two gunmen from Italy to take out Leotardo. But they shot the wrong gray-haired guy, an innocent victim. Meanwhile, the very much alive Leotardo (Frank Vincent) disappeared as his own people struck back. Bobby (Steven R. Schirripa) was shot down in a hobby shop, where the model-train buff was about to buy a new train for his layout. Then Sil (Steven Van Zandt) was critically wounded in the parking lot of the Bada Bing! strip club. Later, word came down that he wasn't expected to regain consciousness. (Patsy Parisi, at the wheel of the car in which Sil was a passenger, was apparently uninjured by the shooters and fled on foot.) Earlier in the hour, Tony's psychiatrist, Dr. Melfi, kicked out her longtime client after conceding, with dismay, that a recent study was right: Sociopaths don't improve from therapy, but use it to sharpen their antisocial skills by manipulating the therapist. "We're making progress," huffed Tony when Melfi (Lorraine Bracco) grimly announced she wouldn't be treating him anymore. "It's been seven years!" The episode ended with Tony sending his wife, Carmela, and their kids, Meadow and A.J., into hiding. "It's just a precaution," Tony insisted. Separated from them, he was last seen in a tiny bedroom of a strange house in the dead of night, cradling a huge weapon, with Paulie and others of his dwindling crew downstairs, on guard. Back at the Bada Bing!, the Doors song "When the Music's Over" had been playing. And even if the viewer didn't know that next week is this HBO series' final episode, the truth was obvious: For Tony and "The Sopranos," time is running out. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder

Speaking at a breakfast gathering at BookExpo America, the publishing industry's annual national convention, O'Donnell said her long-delayed memoir on fame will not be ''vindictive'' or ''mean-spirited,'' but will offer a candid look at her very public life, including her brief, battling stint on ''The View.'' ''It is, in fact, a drug,'' she said of fame, and spoke of seeing peers so radically, and scarily, transformed by celebrity that they looked like victims of ''crystal meth.'' O'Donnell, looking healthy but tired on a Sunday morning, noted that her book was supposed to come out a few years ago, but she decided it wasn't ready, not quite ''cooked.'' Her time on ''The View'' convinced her she was ready to start baking again. She called the book ''half blog,'' half ''straight'' writing. Last month, O'Donnell ended an eight-month tenure on ''The View'' that lifted the show's ratings and, perhaps, the blood pressure of show creator Barbara Walters. O'Donnell feuded with Donald Trump and frequently had snippy exchanges with the more conservative Elisabeth Hasselbeck. ''We've had to change the epilogue,'' she said of ''Celebrity Detox,'' then joked that her next career move would be ''auditioning for 'The Apprentice.''' arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7823387.html Paris Hilton begins serving 3-week jail sentence Hilton begins serving 3-week jail sentence This photo from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office shows Paris Hilton after she turned herself in to begin her three week jail sentence. Jun 4, 2007 at 7:49 AM PDT Jun 4, 2007 at 9:41 AM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Hours after strolling the red carpet in a strapless black dress, Paris Hilton traded her designer duds for a jail-issued jumpsuit. The 26-year-old heiress checked into the Century Regional Detention Facility in Lynwood just after 11:30 p.m. Sunday. She's expected to serve three-weeks for violating her probation in an alcohol-related reckless driving case. Hilton surrendered to sheriff's deputies after making a surprise visit to the MTV Movie Awards in the afternoon. "I am trying to be strong right now," she told reporters on the red carpet. "I'm ready to face my sentence. Even though this is a really hard time, I have my family, my friends and my fans to support me, and that's really helpful." Sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore said Hilton was easy to work with. "Her demeanor was helpful. She was focused, she was cooperative," he said. Hilton turned herself in at the Men's Central Jail in downtown Los Angeles just after 10:30 p.m., then was escorted to the all women's facility in Lynwood, where she was booked, fingerprinted and issued a jail uniform, Whitmore said. She also was given her first meal: cereal, bread and juice. So far, Hilton does not have a cellmate, Whitmore said. The "Simple Life" star will be housed in the "special needs" unit of the 13-year-old jail, separate from most of its 2,200 inmates. The unit contains 12 two-person cells reserved for police officers, public officials, celebrities and other high-profile inmates. Like other inmates in that unit, Hilton will take her meals in her cell and will be allowed outside the 12-foot-by-8-foot space for at least an hour each day to shower, watch TV in the day room, participate in outdoor recreation or talk on the telephone. No cell phones or BlackBerrys are permitted in the facility, even for visitors. The jail, a two-story concrete building next to train tracks and beneath a bustling freeway, has been an all-female facility since March 2006. It's located in an industrial area about five miles southeast of downtown Los Angeles. "I did have a choice to go to a pay jail," Hilton said Sunday, without giving details. "But I declined because I feel like the media portrays me in a way that I'm not and that's why I wanted to go to county, to show that I can do it and I'm going to be treated like everyone else. I'm going to do the time, I'm going to do it the right way." When she was sentenced May 4, Superior Court Judge Michael T. Sauer ruled that she would not be allowed any work release, furloughs or use of an alternative jail or electronic monitoring in lieu of jail. Sometimes stars are allowed to do their time in a jail of their choosing. In such cases they pay a daily room-and-board fee to the smaller jails, which afford them more privacy and comfort. Cop-slapping actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, for example, served three days behind bars in 1990 at the El Segundo jail near the Los Angeles International Airport. She paid $85 a day. On Saturday, about 15 photographers, reporters and television crews staked out the entrances to the jail waiting for the celebutante's arrival. Authorities had also cordoned off a grassy area outside the facility for the media. She had until Tuesday to report. On Sunday, about a dozen photographers and television crews were at the Lynwood facility when she arrived in an unmarked SUV. Video captured by celebrity news site TMZ.com showed Hilton inside the vehicle with her mother, Kathy. Hilton's publicist, Elliot Mintz, said he spoke with Kathy Hilton after she returned from the jail. "She told me it was very emotional," Mintz said. "She also said that she feels this will be a time when Paris will be able to think and reflect and to spend time alone to learn from the experience because in Paris' life she's never alone - there's always a constant chatter around her." Officers arrested Hilton in Hollywood on Sept. 7. In January, she pleaded no contest to the reckless-driving charge and was sentenced to 36 months' probation, alcohol education and $1,500 in fines. She was pulled over by California Highway Patrol on Jan. 15. Officers informed Hilton she was driving on a suspended license and she signed a document acknowledging she was not to drive. She then was pulled over by sheriff's deputies on Feb. 27, at which time she was charged with violating her probation. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7815082.html Birkhead countersues former attorney countersues former attorney Jun 3, 2007 at 3:21 PM PDT Jun 3, 2007 at 3:21 PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Larry Birkhead, the father of Anna Nicole Smith's baby, has countersued his former attorney, claiming she defrauded him out of hundreds of thousands of dollars. The lawsuit filed Friday in Superior Court claims Debra Opri offered to represent Birkhead for free during a paternity dispute involving the baby because the publicity would benefit her career. Birkhead's lawsuit was filed just days after Opri filed her own suit claiming that Birkhead didn't pay his bills for her legal services. Birkhead's lawsuit accuses Opri of depositing at least $865,000 owed to him for an unnamed project into an attorney client trust account against his wishes. After Opri refused to turn over the money, Birkhead fired her, the lawsuit said. ''Opri placed her own career desires and needs as a priority over the needs, interests and desires of her own client,'' the lawsuit said. The lawsuit said Opri solicited donations to a legal fund and revealed confidential information during media interviews - all without Birkhead's consent. Opri is also accused of charging Birkhead for her travel expenses, dinners with friends and entertainment expenses. In a statement released Friday, Opri said her former client was avoiding the issue of his unpaid legal fees. ''He has now admitted, however, that he can pay his legal bills having received over $1 million in a media deal,'' she wrote. ''This does not include the untold millions he has received for selling photos of his daughter.'' Opri has said she spent hundreds of hours working on Birkhead's behalf and had to travel to multiple states and outside the country. Her lawsuit did not specify a dollar amount. Birkhead sued Smith in October seeking a paternity test of her daughter, Dannielynn Hope, to determine who was the baby's father. Howard Stern, Smith's longtime companion and attorney, had also claimed to be the father and was listed on the baby's birth certificate. A Los Angeles judge ruled in Birkhead's favor in December, but the DNA testing was not performed until months later. Smith died in Florida on Feb. 8 of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs. Paternity tests released in April revealed that Birkhead was the baby's father. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7798501.html No TV interviews with Paris Hilton while she's in jail TV interviews with Paris Hilton while she's in jail Jun 1, 2007 at 5:13 PM PDT Jun 1, 2007 at 5:14 PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Sheriff Lee Baca said Friday that Paris Hilton will not be allowed to give television interviews while serving her jail sentence and that aggressive steps were being taken to prevent cameras from being smuggled into the facility. Hilton was ordered to begin her sentence by Tuesday at a county jail in Lynwood, about five miles south of Los Angeles. Baca told the Los Angeles Times that deputies and jail employees have been told to treat the 26-year-old heiress like any other inmate. "Paying a debt to society should not be an element of her celebrity," Baca said. "Her occupation is publicity, but no one should profit in jail." Hilton could report to jail before Tuesday, but as of Friday afternoon had not done so, said sheriff's spokesman Steve Whitmore. She may report at any time of day, said Whitmore. Hollywood photo agencies expect a photo of Hilton in jail would be worth big money. "The reality is why don't they just let her walk down the concrete carpet," said Frank Griffin, co-owner of the Bauer-Griffin paparazzi agency, told the paper. "This is going to be turned into an event like the Oscars." Hilton was sentenced last month to 45 days for violating the terms of her probation in an alcohol-related reckless-driving case after repeatedly driving her car while her license was suspended. Sheriff's officials have said she will serve about 23 days behind bars because of state rules allowing shorter sentences for good behavior. Baca said it was unclear whether Hilton will surrender at the court where she was sentenced or report straight to jail. He said authorities will not allow her to "be seen in handcuffs ... or in the back of a police car, forlorn and in handcuffs." Once there, Hilton will go through the normal intake process, said Baca. That involves undergoing an interview by jail staff and evaluations for any medical or other needs. "Jails are not circuses and not places where `fun' is the priority," Baca said. "Jail should be a corrective learning experience." The jail houses about 2,200 women, but officials have said Hilton will be kept away from the general population. Baca said no decision has been made about whether she'll share a cell with anyone. Hilton will "experience her incarceration as all other women will experience it," said Baca. "She won't get better food, she won't get different lockup time or a different environment." arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7823332.html Chris Cornell returns to form on versatile and rewarding 'Carry On' Cornell returns to form on versatile and rewarding 'Carry On' Jun 4, 2007 at 7:47 AM PDT Jun 4, 2007 at 7:47 AM PDT Soundgarden fell apart, and Audioslave crumbled under creative differences, so it's fitting that Chris Cornell's long overdue second solo disc is entitled "Carry On." The enigmatic singer-songwriter's first solo effort, 1999's experimental "Euphoria Morning," was celebrated by critics and won him a Grammy, but fans didn't appreciate that it sounded nothing like Soundgarden. As before, those who disregard his past will see Cornell's latest introspective adventure for the joyously eclectic journey it is. He brings a light touch but loses none of his intensity, and the disc does rock hard in several places - the versatile "No Such Thing," "Poison Eye" and a fantastic "Your Soul Today" will please even the harshest critic. However, he shines brightest on the low-key, personal moments, particularly the bluesy lament "Safe and Sound" and colorful acoustic tracks like "Ghosts," "Finally Forever" and "Disappearing Act." Cornell's most powerful instrument remains his voice - passionate and commanding but also soft and emotive. His grinding cover of Michael Jackson's "Billie Jean" would have seemed an amusing aside in lesser hands, but is sung with such straight-faced conviction it's oddly contagious. "Carry On" proves Chris Cornell remains a vital voice. Let's hope he stays on his own for a few more creative outbursts. CHECK THIS OUT: For a taste of Cornell's softer side look no further than the lush "Arms Around Your Love," with a slick and minimal guitar lead which floats over one of the catchiest hooks he's ever written. arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7814112.html 'Pirates' sinks but stays on top sinks but stays on top Jun 3, 2007 at 11:45 AM PDT Jun 3, 2007 at 11:45 AM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End'' hit an ebb tide in its second weekend but still had enough buoyancy to hold the No. 1 spot at the box office. With a $43.2 million weekend, Disney's blockbuster sequel sank a steep 62.4 percent from its $114.7 million opening a week earlier, according to studio estimates Sunday. Universal's romantic comedy ''Knocked Up,'' starring Katherine Heigl as a career woman who gets pregnant from a one-night stand with a slacker (Seth Rogen), debuted a strong No. 2 with $29.3 million. The movie's weekend gross equaled its entire production budget. ''It looks like a lot of people wanted to get knocked up this weekend,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Media By Numbers. MGM's thriller ''Mr. Brooks,'' with Kevin Costner as a mild-mannered businessman who moonlights as a serial killer, premiered in fourth place with $10 million. Picturehouse's sports tale ''Gracie,'' featuring Elisabeth Shue in a film inspired by tragic events in her own life and her teenage days as the only girl on a boys soccer team, opened at No. 7 with $1.4 million. The big drop for ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' was typical of summer flicks that open to colossal numbers. In the second weekend, Sony's ''Spider-Man 3'' tumbled 62 percent from its record $151.1 million debut, while DreamWorks Animation's ''Shrek the Third'' fell 57 percent from its $121.6 million opening. While big films once had longer shelf life, most blockbusters today aim to pack in the crowds the first weekend before audiences move on to the next hit. By the second weekend, most people who wanted to catch a big movie already have seen it. ''It's exactly where I expected it,'' said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for Disney. ''Once you get everybody who is that avid, crazy fan that's going to see it the first week, then you rely on people who never go out the first week and the people who just come back and back and back.'' With its mix of serious themes and bawdy humor, director Judd Apatow's ''Knocked Up'' became a rare R-rated comedy to click with a mainstream audience, much as his ''The 40-Year-old Virgin'' did two years ago. Most Hollywood comedies have a softer tone to land a PG-13 rating. ''This could not be reduced to PG-13 just to get a broader audience. It would have lost the beauty of the whole film,'' said Nikki Rocco, head of distribution for Universal. ''It's amazing how Judd hits the exact buttons of what average people go through in their lives.'' Overseas, ''At World's End'' did an additional $105.4 million over the weekend to bring its worldwide total to $625.3 million. Domestically, the movie has grossed $216.5 million, trailing last summer's ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest,'' which had a $135.6 million opening and had taken in $258.4 million after its second weekend. ''Shrek the Third'' took in $26.7 million domestically to lift its total to $254.6 million. It is rolling out gradually overseas. With $7.5 million, ''Spider-Man 3'' padded its domestic haul to $318.3 million. Worldwide, ''Spider-Man 3'' has taken in $844 million, surpassing 2002's ''Spider-Man'' ($821 million) to become the biggest hit in Sony's history. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Media By Numbers LLC. Final figures will be released Monday. 1. ''Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End,'' $43.2 million. 2. ''Knocked Up,'' $29.3 million. 3. ''Shrek the Third,'' $26.7 million. 4. ''Mr. Brooks,'' $10 million. 5. ''Spider-Man 3,'' $7.5 million. 6. ''Waitress,'' $2 million. 7. ''Gracie,'' $1.4 million. 8. ''Bug,'' $1.22 million. 9. ''28 Weeks Later,'' $1.2 million. 10.

http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7823232.html States up ante to lure film and TV production up ante to lure film and TV production Elisabeth Shue and her brother, Andrew, left, both stars of the film "Gracie" respond to questions during a news interview in New York. Jun 4, 2007 at 7:42 AM PDT Jun 4, 2007 at 7:42 AM PDT NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Canada could have easily stood in for New Jersey in the new movie, "Gracie." It doesn't matter that the film is about a New Jersey girl who wants to play soccer on a boys' team, or that part of the story line involves a trip to the famous Jersey shore. For the right price, Canada can become Jersey - or any other location, for that matter - thanks to the magic of Hollywood. But New Jersey offered millions in incentives for the film company to shoot in the Garden State. The "Gracie" courtship illustrates the fierce competition among states and countries for a piece of the lucrative film and television production business. When a major studio shoots a big budget film on location, that can mean $225,000 per day to the local economy, according to the Motion Picture Association of America. Even a brief shoot creates local jobs and generates waves of positive publicity. "It isn't surprising that states are doing everything they can to attract film production to their areas because of the impact they can have on the local economy," said Seth Oster, a spokesman for the group. "The movie industry wants to keep production here in this country whenever possible." Incentives range from breaks on hotel room taxes to actual cash back in a few states. Often the biggest carrot states can offer production companies are breaks from paying state taxes, usually income or corporate business taxes. For production companies or networks that have permanent facilities in a state, the tax credits can offset their own tax liabilities. But film companies working in the state for a single production can sell their tax credits to companies based in that state. To land "Gracie," New Jersey forked over a tax credit of more than $1 million, a $1.5 million loan guarantee on a $4.5 million loan - in addition to a $500,000 loan that doesn't have to be paid back until November 2008. The independent film's budget was only $9.5 million. Andrew Shue, the former "Melrose Place" heartthrob and lead producer for "Gracie," said the producers used the tax credit money to shoot two extra days and pay for music rights for the soundtrack, including a Bruce Springsteen song. "The economics of movie making are getting tougher and tougher," said Shue, whose sister, Elisabeth, co-produced and stars in the film. "The tax credit is a big deal. In our instance, it may have made all the difference." The competition for film and TV is so heated some states have gone back to their legislatures a second or third time to sweeten their financial incentive packages, which have become every bit as important as a state's physical environment. "In the past they (production companies) would call and say, 'Do you have 1940s general store, a 1930s lighthouse, an ultramodern office building, a Victorian train station?"' said Steven Gorelick, associate director of the New Jersey Motion Picture and Television Commission. "Now the location takes a back seat to the economics." According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, more than three dozen states have some form of incentive for the film or TV industry or are looking to pass them. One new player is Connecticut, which last year began its 30 percent tax credit program for productions that spend at least $50,000. Louisiana, which has seen $2 billion in production activity in the past five years, increased its tax credit from 15 percent to 25 percent and offered other incentives, said Chris Stelly, executive director of the state's film commission. "Other states have had incentive programs, but nothing like we're seeing now," he said. Last year, New Mexico increased its package to a 25 percent rebate on state taxes. The state legislature has approved three tweaks to the original 2002 law, said Jennifer Schwalenberg, deputy director of the state's film office. "Everyone's upping the ante every year so we have to stay ahead of the pack," she said. Recent shoots include a remake of "3:10 to Yuma" with Russell Crowe, "In the Valley of Elah" with Tommy Lee Jones and Charlize Theron and "Sunshine Cleaning" with Alan Arkin. Not to be outdone, New Jersey - where Thomas Edison invented the first motion picture camera and projector and created the first studio - wants to increase its annual pot of tax credits from $10 million to $30 million. The Garden State's year-old program offers a 20 percent tax credit, more than its high-profile neighbor, New York, which offers 15 percent. Producers seeking the New Jersey credit must spend 60 percent of all expenses in the state, less post-production costs. That requirement disqualified New Jersey's most high-profile show, "The Sopranos." It receives incentives from New York, where much of the mob drama is shot on a soundstage in Queens, along with location scenes around Jersey, said a spokeswoman for HBO. Still, in its first year offering incentives, New Jersey attracted three feature films with big stars. "Be Kind Rewind," stars Jack Black and has been approved by the state for $2 million in credits; Newark native Queen Latifah's "Perfect Christmas" opens in December and received $1.2 million in tax credits. Another production for which she is a producer, a television pilot called "Wifeys," has been approved for nearly $300,000. "If it gets picked up, the tax credit will make New Jersey competitive as a place to shoot the series," said Mike Elliott, an executive producer of the show and a producer for "Perfect Christmas." The first film to use the credits and appear in theaters is "Gracie," a feel-good soccer tale that opened June 1. Gorelick concedes the state didn't see an increase in productions in the first year of the program. But he said it was important in keeping "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit," a television series set in New York City which has been approved for almost half of the credits for the year, nearly $4.5 million. "A TV show is worth millions and millions and millions every year on an ongoing basis, like an annuity," he said. Brian O'Leary, senior vice president for tax counsel of NBC Universal, which produces "SVU," said in an e-mail the studio would not be filming the series in New Jersey if the incentives had not been passed. Not everyone is happy, though. State Assemblyman Joe Pennacchio shudders at the idea of increasing New Jersey's incentive pot to $30 million in a state with the nation's highest property taxes and a huge budget deficit. "Is this a good use of money? They think it's sexy," he said. "But the taxpayers are getting whacked." arrested in fatal hit-and-run Cop mistakes daughter as intruder and shoots her Bee blamed for causing fatal bicycle crash Rare colorful lobster caught in Rhode Island Man expected to recover from train crash Colombia fights Bellevue diver over sunken treasure 5 Idahoans killed in Burbank crash Woman suffers serious head injuries in motorcycle crash Huge tree crashes down on emergency crew amid rescue Supreme Court reinstates death sentence in King County murder
