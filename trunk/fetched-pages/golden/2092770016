AM PDT AM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Brandy and a man who was hurt in a deadly freeway crash involving her Range Rover are suing each other. Brandy, whose real name is Brandy Norwood, and Mallory Ham of Simi Valley accuse each other of negligence in lawsuits filed last week in Superior Court. In court papers filed Wednesday, the 28-year-old singer-actress contends that Ham caused the Dec. 30 crash on the San Diego Freeway in Sherman Oaks. She also denies allegations made against her in a previous lawsuit, asserts her Fifth Amendment privileges against self-incrimination and requests a jury trial. Ham's lawsuit, filed Friday, contends Brandy drove recklessly and seeks unspecified damages. Brandy had no immediate comment on the lawsuit. "She's just responding to pieces of litigation as they come in and doesn't want to comment at this time," Edwin McPherson, an attorney representing Brandy, said Tuesday. A California Highway Patrol report said Brandy's 2007 Range Rover failed to slow in traffic and was doing 65 mph when it struck another car that in turn was hit by Ham's vehicle. The crash killed Awatef Aboudihaj, 38, of Los Angeles. Her husband has sued both Brandy and Ham for reckless driving. Aboudihaj's parents and her two children also have separate lawsuits pending against Brandy. The city attorney's office is still deciding whether to charge Brandy with misdemeanor vehicular manslaughter, spokesman Frank Mateljan said Tuesday. If charged and convicted, she could face up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine.
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7764357.html Justin Timberlake launches record label in joint venture with Interscope Timberlake launches record label in joint venture with Interscope May 31, 2007 at 7:42 AM PDT May 31, 2007 at 7:42 AM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Justin Timberlake, music star and movie star, is aiming to add another glittering line to his resume - star maker. The pop singer will sign artists and release their music through a new record label he's heading that's a joint venture with Universal Music Group's Interscope Geffen A&M label group. "We are all excited about the talent we have to offer already on our roster, and I cannot wait to introduce the world to my new discoveries," Timberlake said in a statement issued Monday. Timberlake will serve as chairman and chief executive of the new label, dubbed Tennman Records, which will be based in Los Angeles and distributed globally by Interscope. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Day-to-day operations will be handled by Ken Komisar, a former vice president at Sony BMG Music Entertainment, who was named president at Tennman. Timberlake's first two solo albums - 2002's "Justified" and last year's "FutureSex/LoveSounds" - have sold more than 13 million copies combined. He's currently on the big screen, at least his voice is, in the mega-hit "Shrek the Third."
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7745457.html Hilarious 'Knocked Up' finds balance of raunchy and sweet 'Knocked Up' finds balance of raunchy and sweet AM PDT AM PDT By CHRISTY LEMIRE, AP Film Critic Everything you've heard about "Knocked Up" is true: It's even more riotously and consistently hilarious than its predecessor, Judd Apatow's 2005 sleeper hit "The 40-Year-Old Virgin," with even greater heart. No small feat. As writer and director, Apatow has the rare ability to find just the right tone all the time - a bold yet delicate balance of humor that's raunchy without being mean, sweet without being saccharine. "Knocked Up" also features a cavalcade of pop culture references that never feel gratuitous, as well as some in-jokes that never seem smug. Here's how good Apatow is: He even manages to make Ryan Seacrest funny, in one spectacular scene in which the "American Idol" host takes a sledgehammer to his self-important image. Seth Rogen, who we already knew was funny from his scene-stealing performance in "Virgin," emerges as an unlikely but likable leading man as Ben Stone, a goofball of a slacker-stoner who enjoys a drunken romp with Alison Scott (Katherine Heigl from "Grey's Anatomy" showing an unexpected knack for comedy), an up-and-coming entertainment reporter who's way out of his league. Eight weeks later, she realizes she's pregnant - and, to borrow from Madonna, she's made up her mind, she's keeping her baby - forcing both of them to make major changes in their lives. (The fact that Apatow approaches the idea of abortion and lets his characters ponder it before Alison chooses to have the child, without entering into any sort of heavy-handed moral or political debate, is just one more example of his assured touch.) Clearly these people are totally wrong for each other. Ben is round and hairy; Alison is leggy and blonde. He sits around all day with his equally unmotivated buddies, working on a Web site that lists the exact moment when actresses get naked in movies; she wakes up early, spends time with her family and takes her job seriously at E! Entertainment Television. But they must get to know each other, first as friends and then possibly as something deeper, if they're going to make this work. It doesn't exactly help that their primary example is Alison's older sister Debbie (Apatow's radiant wife, Leslie Mann) and her husband, Pete (Paul Rudd, always a subtle comic talent), who don't have much in common anymore besides their two kids. On Ben's side, there's even less help. The friends with whom he shares a tract house in the San Fernando Valley (Jason Segel, Jonah Hill, Martin Starr and Jay Baruchel, all old pals from "Virgin" and Apatow's short-lived TV shows "Freaks and Geeks" and "Undeclared") say they support him but they'd have no idea what to do with a baby, and they're too high all the time to figure it out. This description, of course, makes these guys sounds useless and paints them into a corner as overly familiar types. But one of the best aspects of Apatow's script is that he makes his characters feel incredibly real. These are people who love movies and television and pop culture, and their analytical discussions of these topics always sound completely genuine. You may not get all the jokes - references to "Murderball" and Matisyahu play differently in different cities - but you'll laugh hard enough and often enough to want to go back a second time and catch the lines you missed. When they tool on each other - which they do constantly - you know it's with affection, and Apatow obviously has great affection for them, too. Much of their banter was improvised, and Heigl, in a rare leading film role, steps confidently and easily into this male-dork-dominated society. It would be easy to write her off as eye candy, playing the straight woman amid a bevy of actors who get far showier roles, but she very much holds her own. "Knocked Up" starts out with a one-night stand, but in the end it turns out to be a movie about loyalty. And except for being a bit on the long side - which you won't mind because you'll be having too much fun - it's pretty close to perfect. "Knocked Up," a Universal Pictures release, is rated R for sexual content, drug use and language. Running time: 129 minutes. Four stars out of four.

http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7730077.html Britney Spears weighs in on rehab, tabloids Spears weighs in on rehab, tabloids May 29, 2007 at 12:15 PM PDT May 29, 2007 at 5:30 PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Britney Spears says she "hit rock bottom," in a message posted on her Web site about the end of her marriage and her time in rehab. Spears calls rehab "a very humbling place" and denies that it was alcohol or depression that sent her there. "I truly hit rock bottom," the 25-year-old pop star writes. "I was like a bad kid running around with ADD." Spears completed a monthlong stay at a luxury Malibu rehabilitation treatment facility in March after a series of run-ins with the paparazzi that included a stop at a San Fernando Valley hair salon, where she was caught on video shearing her own locks. Other photos splashed across the Internet appeared to reveal Spears out partying wearing nothing underneath her short skirts. She was seen going out with Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan after filing for divorce from aspiring rapper Kevin Federline last November, just two months after giving birth to their second child, Jayden James. The pair also have an older son, Sean Preston, now 20 months. The couple reached a divorce settlement in March. "I had a manager from a long time ago come in and try to direct me and my life after I got my divorce," writes Spears. "I was so overwhelmed I think that I was in a little shock too. I didn't know who to go to." "I realized how much energy and love I had put into my past relationship when it was gone because I genuinely did not know what to do with myself, and it made me so sad. I confess, I was so lost," she writes. Explaining her recent behavior, she says: "I think it is actually normal for a young girl to go out after a huge divorce." Spears also says she is "having to face a lot of things" as she raises her two young sons. "A lot of insecurities from when I was little are coming up again," she writes. "It is like we are never good enough." But Spears says she's no longer "angry at the tabloids," and now tries to "be numb to what I see." "I am going to make mistakes everyday, and I am sure every mistake I make will probably be on CNN or `Good Morning America,"' she writes. "I am only human people and I love you for still loving me." She closes by saying, "We will never really understand or figure out life completely. That's God's job. I can't wait to meet him ... or her. Love, Britney."
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7764512.html Competition narrows to 59 in national spelling bee narrows to 59 in national spelling bee Kennyi Aouad, 11, bursts into laughter when asked to spell the word, "Sardoodledom," during the Scripps National Spelling Bee. May 31, 2007 at 7:45 AM PDT May 31, 2007 at 7:45 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - For most kids, the appearance of the word "Bewusstseinslage" on any kind of test would be reason to shriek in horror. For Matthew Evans, it was cause for joy. "My favorite word!" said the 12-year-old boy from Albuquerque, N.M. The 80th Scripps National Spelling Bee began by reducing the record field of 286 spellers to 59 on Wednesday. Those who survived will return for the semifinals and finals Thursday, and the champion will be crowned on prime-time national television. Most of the winnowing was done with a 25-word multiple-choice test, followed by three oral rounds that featured a display of confidence, nervousness and befuddlement - not to mention sheer relief when a guess proved correct. "Yes!" exclaimed 12-year-old Tia Thomas of Coarsegold, Calif., who pumped her fists and skipped back to her seat after correctly spelling "periostracum" (the hard covering of a mollusk shell). "I was pretty sure I knew the word," Tia said. "But the 'peri' part was guessing." Matthew and Tia, both in the national bee for the fourth time, are two of the favorites to become the champion. The winner receives $35,000 cash, a $5,000 scholarship, a $2,500 savings bond and a complete set of reference works. Achieving that goal will require outlasting 13-year-old Samir Patel of Colleyville, Texas, who is back for the fifth year after placing third, 27th, second and 14th. With his grandfather from India - visiting the United States for the first time - sitting on the front row, Samir breezed through "decor" in the preliminary round, and "trumpery" (of low quality) and "sunglo" (a green Chinese tea) in the quarterfinals. "I'm a lot more prepared than I was the first year," Samir said. "I'm not as nervous, and I already know sort of the routine, so I'm not so much worried about 'Am I going to be there on time?' 'Am I going to make a mistake in walking down the stage?"' Far removed from the glamour of the rounds that will be televised on ESPN and ABC on Thursday, the bee started early in the morning in a setting that more closely resembled a classroom of students taking the SAT. Spellers from English-speaking parts of the world filled in ovals with their No. 2 pencils during the multiple-choice test, which included words ranging from "icicle" to "ylem" (a hypothetical substance from the early universe). Matthew was happily surprised when he saw that the 25th word was Bewusstseinslage (a state of consciousness, pronounced bay-VOOHST-sines-lahg-eh), which he likes "just because it's so weird-sounding." "I was like, 'Oh my goodness. Wow! This is awesome,"' said Matthew, who got 24 of 25 correct. Then all of the spellers were given their only guaranteed moment on the Grand Hyatt's ballroom stage: a chance to spell one word before the audience of parents, friends and judges. "Macaroni - what does it mean?" asked 14-year-old Michael Yeh of Kokomo, Ind., exercising his right to ask for a definition before correctly spelling the popular food. The multiple choice test (worth 25 points) and the preliminary oral round (worth three points) narrowed the field to 107. Thirteen more were eliminated in the next round, and 35 heard the telltale bell signaling an incorrect response in the day's final round. Every year there are spellers who have their own quirks to help them stay focused. This year, some wrote letters in the air, others on their hands. Jonathan Horton, 14, of Gilbert, Ariz., who finished in a tie for sixth last year, has developed a rhythm in which he turns his head and appears to feign a cough several times while spelling a word. He did it four times while working through the 10 letters of "exhilarate." "I say a couple of letters into my hand, and then I say them out loud," said Jonathan, who also advanced to the semifinals. "I do that because I don't want to say the wrong letter out loud." Aishwarya Pastapur of Overland Park, Kan., made her feelings known by wearing a T-shirt with the words "mishpelt werds eeritate me." She displayed no irritation whatsoever by correctly spelling "enumerated" in the preliminaries, but she was stumped by "coadunation" (union of a large body) in the quarterfinals. Kennyi Aouad, 11, of Terre Haute, Ind., became a crowd favorite after he couldn't stop laughing when he was given the funky-sounding word "Sardoodledom" (a melodramatic plot). He finally composed himself and asked all sorts of questions about the word - definition, part of speech, alternate pronunciations, use in a sentence - then tried to get an unallowable hint by asking: "Is it kind of like kingdom?" He could hardly believe it when he spelled the word correctly.
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7734982.html Lohan checks into rehab after weekend crash and DUI arrest checks into rehab after weekend crash and DUI arrest May 29, 2007 at 4:30 PM PDT May 29, 2007 at 4:30 PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Lindsay Lohan has checked into rehab. The move followed a weekend during which the wild-child actress crashed her Mercedes, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence and was photographed closed-eyed and slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car. The 20-year-old "admitted herself to an intensive medical rehabilitation facility" on Monday, according to a statement released by her publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnick. The statement added, "Because this is a medical matter, it is our hope that the press will appreciate the seriousness of the situation and respect the privacy of Lindsay as well as the other patients receiving treatment at the facility." This is Lohan's second rehab stint this year. She said in January that she had checked into a rehabilitation center for substance abuse treatment. "It's so weird that I went to rehab," Lohan said in Allure magazine's May issue. "I always said I would die before I went to rehab." Lohan was arrested Saturday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence after her car hopped a curb and hit a shrub on Sunset Boulevard. Witnesses called police, who arrived to find both Lohan and the vehicle missing from the accident site, said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Mitch McCann. "We tracked down the vehicle to a nearby apartment complex and tracked down Ms. Lohan to a Century City hospital," he said Tuesday. Officers investigating the crash also found a substance tentatively identified as cocaine. The case remains under investigation, McCann said. Lohan could face additional charges for leaving the scene, he said, adding "we would take into consideration that she was injured and transported to a hospital." Her preliminary court date is scheduled for Aug. 24. She will be represented by attorneys Blair Berk and Jason Sloane. Neither returned calls for comment Tuesday. Lohan was back out on the town before the Memorial Day weekend was over. Photographers captured her slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car early Monday morning. The photos, posted online, show a sweatshirt-clad Lohan with her mouth open and her eyes shut, apparently asleep. "The world has been very hard on her," said Michael Heller, an attorney and Lohan family friend. "She has a lot of personal issues and family issues. There's an incredible amount of pressure on this 20-year-old." He also noted on Tuesday that Lohan has "gone from one movie to the next," spending long stretches of time away from her family. "She's living in a hotel," he said. "It's a very lonely existence." Lohan's mother, Dina Lohan, told Us Weekly magazine earlier this month that when her daughter isn't working, "she's so bored." "I've told her, `Please slow down. Stop!' She's growing up and learning to do that. She really loves the business," the mother said. Lohan was originally set to begin work this week on "Poor Things," a comedy starring Shirley MacLaine, Olympia Dukakis, Rosario Dawson and Channing Tatum, the trade paper Variety reported Monday. The company behind the project, Still Rolling Productions, did not return calls or e-mails from The Associated Press Tuesday. Lohan did her first movie at age 11: Disney's remake of "The Parent Trap." Her breakout role came in 2004's "Mean Girls." She released her debut album that same year. Her other screen credits include "Freaky Friday," "Bobby" and "A Prairie Home Companion." Her most recent movie, "Georgia Rule," is in theaters now. During its production last summer, one of the film's producers chastised Lohan for her "various late arrivals and absences from the set." "We are well aware that your ongoing all night heavy partying is the real reason for your so-called `exhaustion,"' James G. Robinson wrote in a letter made public in July 2006. Lohan will turn 21 on July 2. "This is a time when she will reflect backwards and think forward," Heller said. "Hopefully she will plan a future that will be fruitful artistically, professionally (and) take a place in society that will be appropriate for someone of her standing."

The sleeveless dress, worn for the scene in which Holly Golightly discovers her brother has died, sold for $192,000 to a private European buyer at Christie's sale of film and entertainment memorabilia. The iconic black dress she also wore in the film sold for more than $800,000 last year at London auction. Christie's said it had expected the pink dress to sell for as much as $30,000. "The sale was filled with iconic pieces," said Helen Hall, Christie's head of entertainment memorabilia. "It captured people's imagination." Hall said the auction house was pleased with the results of the sale, which brought in $1.2 million. Other items on the block included Marilyn Monroe's script for "Something's Got To Give," with the actress' handwritten notes, which sold for $19,200. A program from President John F. Kennedy's birthday celebration that featured the actress at Madison Square Garden went for $66,000. All the prices include the Christie's commission.
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7756047.html Michael Lohan says Lindsey is hooked on alcohol and OxyContin Lohan says Lindsey is hooked on alcohol and OxyContin PM PDT PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Lindsay Lohan's estranged father says she suffers from multiple addictions, including alcohol and the painkiller OxyContin, the Web site E! Online reported Wednesday. The 20-year-old actress checked into rehab Monday following a weekend that included crashing her Mercedes, being arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence and being photographed slumped in the passenger seat of a friend's car. This is her second rehab stint this year. "I spoke to the people treating Lindsay, because I wanted to make sure she was getting the right care," Michael Lohan told E! Online. "And I'm satisfied they are doing the right thing for her, helping her detox from the painkillers and things. That's a very important step." Lindsay Lohan's publicist, Leslie Sloane Zelnik, did not immediately return an after-hours call and e-mail from The Associated Press on Wednesday. Michael Lohan was released from a New York state prison in March after serving almost two years for driving while intoxicated and other charges. He said he is studying to become a drug-rehab counselor with the faith-based organization Teen Challenge. Before entering rehab, the actress was scheduled to start work this week on "Poor Things," a comedy featuring Shirley MacLaine, who is also a producer on the movie. MacLaine and co-producer Rob Hickman said in a statement Wednesday that Lohan still wants to work on the project. "We are trying to rearrange the shooting schedule to facilitate her working at the end of the shoot to coincide with the completion of her rehabilitation," the statement said. In other events swirling around Lohan, who turns 21 on July 2, authorities who have been conducting undercover operations at trendy celebrity watering holes in recent weeks are seeking to find out if she was served alcohol before her weekend car crash. California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control investigators also want to know if Lohan or others were served after hours, agency spokesman John Carr said. Videos show Lohan leaving Hollywood's Les Deux club at 3:30 a.m. Alcohol cannot be served in California after 2 a.m. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control told the Beverly Hills Police Department it wants to review witness reports and other evidence to determine if a formal investigation is warranted, Carr said. Les Deux owner Lonnie Moore said in a statement that Lohan stayed late having dinner and waiting for friends, and wasn't drinking.

On Tuesday's show, Hasselbeck said she and O'Donnell were "in communication a lot," though Hasselbeck didn't say whether they had talked on the phone or exchanged e-mails. Their confrontation last Wednesday led to O'Donnell's early departure from the daytime chatfest. "This weekend gave us the opportunity to tackle our most important Hot Topic yet, and that was the power of forgiveness, and I believe that we've begun that process," Hasselbeck said. "And so now that enables us to move on in a very positive way. ... I'm really happy about that." Show creator and co-host Barbara Walters said Tuesday she had been sending e-mails to O'Donnell and they remain "close friends." Walters also said O'Donnell is welcome back to "The View" as a panelist at anytime. The argument between Hasselbeck and O'Donnell began over O'Donnell's earlier statement about the war: "655,000 Iraqi civilians had died. Who are the terrorists?" Talk-show critics accused O'Donnell of calling U.S. troops terrorists. She called Hasselbeck "cowardly" for not saying anything in response to the critics, which set off their lengthy argument. On Friday, ABC said O'Donnell asked for, and received, an early exit from her contract. O'Donnell said last month she would be leaving because she couldn't agree to a new contract with ABC executives. In a video blog posted Saturday on her Web site, O'Donnell said she didn't think she and Hasselbeck would ever speak again. "I haven't spoken to her, and I probably won't, and I think it's just as well," O'Donnell said. "I wrote her an e-mail, and she wrote me back, and there you have it." O'Donnell also said she never really fit in on the show.
http://www.komotv.com/news/entertainment/7756132.html Fred Thompson, weighing presidential bid, will leave 'Law & Order' Thompson, weighing presidential bid, will leave 'Law & Order' PM PDT PM PDT LOS ANGELES (AP) - Fred Thompson, edging toward a presidential run, is giving up his day job playing a prosecutor on the TV series "Law & Order." Thompson asked Wednesday to be released from the show after five seasons, series creator and executive producer Dick Wolf said. "Although he told me he has not made a firm decision about his political future, he felt that given the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season," he should leave "Law & Order," Wolf said in a statement. The producer lauded Thompson's commitment to "Law & Order" and the new TV movie "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee," in which the actor plays a president - Ulysses S. Grant. The film, which Wolf produced, premiered last Sunday on HBO. Thompson, 64, a former U.S. senator from Tennessee, has yet to announce he's seeking the GOP nomination but has taken steps toward a summer entry into the crowded field. He has been casting himself in speeches and on the Internet as a Reaganesque conservative. Thompson, a lawyer, began his acting career with the film "Marie" in 1985, about a high-profile legal case he handled in Tennessee and in which he played himself. His credits also include "In the Line of Fire" and "The Hunt for Red October." Thompson served in the Senate from 1994 to 2002, resuming his Hollywood career when he left. On NBC's "Law & Order," which has been renewed for its 18th year, he played New York District Attorney Arthur Branch. sparks chaos with reckless U-turns
