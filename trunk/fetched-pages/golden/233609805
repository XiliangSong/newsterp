http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7729407.html Americans divided on whether doctors should divided on whether doctors should AM PDT AM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - More than two-thirds of Americans believe there are circumstances in which a patient should be allowed to die, but they are closely divided on whether for a doctor to their own lives by prescribing fatal drugs, a new AP-Ipsos poll finds. The results were released Tuesday, just days before Dr. Jack Kevorkian is freed from a Michigan prison after serving more than eight years for second-degree murder in the poisoning of a man with Lou Gehrig's disease. Kevorkian's defiant assisted suicide campaign, which he waged for years before his conviction, fueled nationwide debate about patients' right to die and the role that physicians should play. Though demonized by his critics as a callous killer, Kevorkian - who is to be released Friday - maintains relatively strong public support. The AP-Ipsos poll found that 53 percent of those surveyed thought he should not have been jailed; 40 percent supported his imprisonment. The results were similar to an ABC News poll in 1999 that found 55 percent disagreeing with his conviction. The new AP-Ipsos poll asked whether for doctors to prescribe lethal drugs to their own lives - a practice currently allowed in Oregon but in no other states. Forty-eight percent said 44 percent said More broadly, 68 percent said there are circumstances when a patient should be allowed to die, while 30 percent said doctors and nurses, in all circumstances, should do everything possible to save the life of a patient. A majority of respondents - 55 percent - said they would not consider ending their own lives if ill with a terminal disease. Thirty-five percent said they would consider that option. Oregon's physician-assisted suicide law took effect in 1997. Through last year, 292 people - mostly stricken with cancer - have died under its provisions, which allow terminally ill, mentally competent adults to administer life-ending medication prescribed by a physician. In addition to Oregon, three European countries - Switzerland, Belgium and the Netherlands - authorize assistance by doctors in the deaths of patients. Oregon's law has been reaffirmed by state voters and has survived intense legal challenges, but has yet to be emulated in any other state. Bills have been defeated by lawmakers in Vermont, Hawaii, Wisconsin and Washington; ballot measures to allow physician-assisted death have lost in Washington, California, Michigan and Maine. The current battleground is California, where a bill similar to Oregon's law is moving through the legislature. Even if it were to win final passage, there is uncertainty whether Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger would sign it; he recently suggested the issue should go directly to voters as a ballot initiative. Assemblywoman Patty Berg, a co-author of the bill, said it gives a terminally ill patient "the power to chose the time, place and circumstances of their death." She contended that most Californians support the measure, but that it faces tough opposition from the Roman Catholic Church, some conservative Protestant churches, and the California Medical Association. "Physicians look at it as the ultimate abandonment of a patient," said medical association spokesman Ron Lopp. "That's not the physician's role, to aggressively hasten death." The AP-Ipsos poll showed that religious faith is a significant factor in views on the subject. Only 34 percent of those who attend religious services at least once a week think for doctors to their own lives. In contrast, 70 percent of those who never attend religious services thought the practice should be legal. Just 23 percent of those who attend religious services at least weekly would consider ending their own lives if terminally ill, compared to 49 percent of those who never attend religious services. There also was a divide along partisan lines, with 57 percent of Democrats saying for doctors to their own lives compared to 39 percent of Republicans. Similarly, 56 percent of Republicans felt Kevorkian should have been jailed, compared to 31 percent of Democrats. Men were more likely to say they would consider ending their own lives if faced with a terminal illness - 43 percent of men would consider the option, compared to just 28 percent of women. And 53 percent of men think for doctors to help end the lives of terminally ill patients, compared to 44 percent of women. Southerners and Midwesterners are most likely to oppose assisted suicide. The poll found that 59 percent of Northeasterners feel the practice should be legal, compared with 52 percent in the West, 45 percent in the Midwest, and 43 percent in the South. The AP-Ipsos poll involved telephone interviews with 1,000 randomly chosen adults from May 22-24. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.
http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7730092.html New fitness vibration plates popular but may be risky, experts say fitness vibration plates popular but may be risky, experts say Trainer Michela Rossi demonstrates an exercise on a Power Plate fitness machine for Amy at the Power Plate Institute in Chicago. PM PDT PM PDT CHICAGO (AP) - What if you could burn fat while shaking a martini? Actually, it's your body that shakes like a martini on a new type of fitness machine that's generating lots of buzz and celebrity use. Even NASA has tested the concept. These machines use vibrations to tone muscle and claim to do it faster. Aggressive promoters also say the equipment improves flexibility and strength, reduces pain and stress, builds muscle and reverses osteoporosis. However, researchers warn of possible injuries ranging from back pain to cartilage damage. One even warns that the high-powered jiggling might harm the brain. They say the science is thin and too little is known about the long-term effects of such powerful vibrations. Still, NASA is studying vibration as a possible tool for reducing muscle atrophy and bone loss during astronauts' long, weightless trips in space. And users of the equipment love the sensation and the quick workout. Workout times are reduced by two-thirds, advocates say, a claim that appeals to busy professionals, mothers of young children and just about anyone who shuns exercise. "I feel kind of tingly and a little like I got off a ship, kind of shaky but in a good way," said Amy Allen, a 40-year-old working mom in Chicago, after a 25-minute workout on the Power Plate, one of the higher-end brands. "I'm hoping this is the solution to help me get that extra weight off." The Power Plate vibrates 20 to 50 times a second in three directions, increasing g-forces on the body, and according to the Northbrook, Ill.-based company of the same name. The company says that raises the effectiveness of lunges, squats and other exercises done while standing on it. The workout is not aerobic; it's more like weightlifting without weights. "You don't really feel like you're working that hard, but then you get that sweat going and once the vibration stops, you can really feel it in your legs or upper body," said Michaela Zakheim, 45, who uses the machine at a fitness center in her Lincoln Park neighborhood. Power Plate sells models for home and gym at prices ranging from $3,000 to $10,500. Motors in the base make a low humming noise. Controls adjust the duration and intensity. The machines weigh 264 to 500 pounds and have handles to hang onto. Fitness trainers love them, but some users don't like the fact they can't read or watch TV while working out on them, said Craig Bradley, general manager of Holmes Place, an upscale Chicago health club that has four Power Plates. Doubts also stem from memories of the belt vibrators popular 50 years ago. Others have been won over though. "I think the machines are as good as the imagination of the person using them," Bradley said. Dozens of companies have entered the market, including Soloflex which has sold more than 30,000 of its $295 vibrating, skateboard-like, handle-free platforms in less than three years, said Jerry Wilson, the Hillsboro, Ore.-based company's CEO and founder. "We get reports back that it helps people with incontinence," Wilson said. "Their aches and pains have gone away. They're stronger. They sleep better. It has basically the same effects as if they'd started an exercise program." A study at NASA's Johnson Space Center showed that the use of a vibration platform during exercise squats made muscles work more, but it didn't look at whether vibration makes athletes run faster or jump higher. "Vibration works ... but we're still trying to figure out how to use it best and I think we're a number of years away before we do that," said Bill Amonette, one of the study authors and a fitness expert at the University of Houston-Clear Lake. "I think we have to be cautious of some of the claims. ... With aggressive marketing, sometimes they claim things that aren't necessarily true." Some researchers are also concerned that high-amplitude vibration can be dangerous over time since it can send jarring waves throughout the body, said Andrew Abercromby, another researcher at Johnson Space Center. "I believe, and I think quite a few other people believe, the jury is still out on it," Abercromby said. Clinton Rubin, a biomedical engineering professor at State University of New York at Stony Brook, said he has asked Power Plate to stop citing his research in its promotional materials. His work has led to a vibration device before the Food and Drug Administration approval for prevention and reversal of bone loss from osteoporosis, but that device uses much gentler vibrations than Power Plate, Rubin said. He believes the Power Plate's vibration levels could cause low back pain, cartilage damage, blurred vision, hearing loss and even brain damage. "I think they are cavalier in dismissing the dangers of chronic exposure," he said. "I'm a scientist. I worry that people are going to use this device based on a misrepresentation of science." Power Plate warns pregnant women and people with retinal detachment, blood clots, bone tumors and other medical conditions not to use the machines. Soloflex recommends using its device only 30 minutes a day because too much use would exceed industry standards for safe vibrations in the workplace. (The Occupational Safety and Health Administration doesn't set safety levels for fitness equipment, an agency spokesman said.) "I own a steel factory so I know whole body vibration has allowable exposure limits," Wilson said. "But too much aspirin is bad for one too."
http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7730187.html Govt. quarantines man with dangerous case of TB quarantines man with dangerous case of TB PM PDT PM PDT ATLANTA (AP) - A man with a rare and dangerous form of tuberculosis ignored doctors' advice and took two trans-Atlantic flights, leading to the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963, health officials said Tuesday. The man, who officials did not identify, is at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital in respiratory isolation. He was potentially infectious at the time of the flights, so officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended medical exams for cabin crew members on those flights, as well as passengers sitting in the same rows or within two rows. CDC officials did not release row numbers but said the airlines were working with health officials to contact those passengers. Passengers who should be tested will be contacted by health officials from their home countries. The infected man flew from Atlanta to Paris on May 12 aboard Air France Flight 385. He returned to North America on May 24 aboard Czech Air Flight 0104 from Prague to Montreal. The man then drove into the United States at the Champlain, N.Y., border crossing. The man told health officials he was not coughing during the flights. Tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in him was low, so passengers are not considered to be at high risk of infection, said Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine. The man had been told by health officials in early May that he had a form of TB that was resistant to first-line antibiotics and was advised not to travel to Europe. "He was told traveling is against medical advice," said Dr. Steven Katkowsky, director of the Fulton County Department of Health & Wellness. Health officials said they don't know how the Georgia man was infected. The government issued the quarantine after a CDC official reached the man by phone in Rome and told him not to take commercial flights, but he flew back to North America anyway. "He was told in no uncertain terms not to take a flight back," Cetron said. Cetron reached the man once he was back in the United States. At that point, he voluntarily went to a New York hospital, then was flown by the CDC to the Atlanta hospital. He is not facing prosecution, health officials said. The quarantine order was the first since 1963, when the government quarantined a patient with smallpox, according to the CDC. The man, who went on the trip with his wife, also traveled within Europe, but CDC officials said they did not have information to release about whether the trips were by plane, train or other public transportation. His wife tested negative for TB before the trip and is not considered a public health risk, health officials said. CDC officials said they are concentrating on investigating the trans-Atlantic flights, when possibility of spread of the disease was greatest because he was in a confined space with other people for many hours. Tuberculosis is a disease caused by germs that are spread from person to person through the air. It usually affects the lungs and can lead to symptoms such as chest pain and coughing up blood. It kills nearly 2 million people each year worldwide. Because of antibiotics and other measures, the TB rate in the United States has been falling for years. Last year, it hit an all-time low of 13,767 cases, or about 4.6 cases per 100,000 Americans. Health officials worry about "multidrug-resistant" TB, which can withstand the mainline antibiotics isoniazid and rifampin. The man was infected with something even worse - "extensively drug-resistant" TB, also called XDR-TB, which resists many drugs used to treat the infection. There have been 17 U.S. XDR-TB cases since 2000, according to CDC statistics. Three-quarters were people from foreign countries. One case was a Russian man who arrived in Phoenix last year. He was jailed after he stopped taking medications and went unmasked to a restaurant and other businesses, threatening the health of others. The CDC's statement that the patient is at the low end of communicability "provides some reassurance," said Dr. William Schaffner, chairman of the department of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University. The highly dangerous form is "expanding around the world," particularly in South Africa, eastern Europe and the former states of the Soviet Union, he said.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7749147.html CDC looking for 80 passengers, 27 crew from TB flights looking for 80 passengers, 27 crew from TB flights PM PDT PM PDT ATLANTA (AP) - A man with a form of tuberculosis so dangerous he is under the first U.S. government-ordered quarantine since 1963 had health officials around the world scrambling Wednesday to find about 80 passengers who sat within five rows of him on two trans-Atlantic flights. The man told a newspaper he took the first flight from Atlanta to Europe for his wedding, then the second flight home because he feared he might die without treatment in the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Julie Gerberding said Wednesday that the CDC is working closely with airlines to find passengers who may have been exposed to the rare, dangerous strain. Health officials in France said they have asked Air France-KLM for passenger lists, and the Italian Health Ministry said it is tracing the man's movements. "Is the patient himself highly infectious? Fortunately, in this case, he's probably not," Gerberding said. "But the other piece is this bacteria is a very deadly bacteria. We just have to err on the side of caution." Dr. Martin Cetron, director of the CDC's division of global migration and quarantine, said Wednesday that the agency was trying to contact 27 crew members from the two flights for testing and about 80 passengers who sat in the five rows surrounding the man. About 40 or 50 of those people sat in or near Row 51 on the Air France flight from Atlanta to Paris, and about 30 passengers were in or near seat 12C on the second flight, from Prague to Montreal. Health officials said the man had been advised not to fly and knew he could expose others when he boarded the jets. The man, however, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that doctors didn't order him not to fly and only suggested he put off his long-planned wedding in Greece. He knew he had a form of tuberculosis and that it was resistant to first-line drugs, but he didn't realize until he was already in Europe that it could be so dangerous, he said. "We headed off to Greece thinking everything's fine," said the man, who declined to be identified because of the stigma attached to his diagnosis. He flew to Paris on May 12 aboard Air France Flight 385, also listed as Delta Air Lines codeshare Flight 8517. While he was in Europe, health authorities reached him with the news that further tests had revealed his TB was a rare, "extensively drug-resistant" form, far more dangerous than he knew. They ordered him into isolation, saying he should turn himself over to Italian officials. Instead, the man flew from Prague to Montreal on May 24 aboard Czech Air Flight 0104, then drove into the United States at Champlain, N.Y. He told the newspaper he was afraid that if he didn't get back to the U.S., he wouldn't get the treatment he needed to survive. He is now at Atlanta's Grady Memorial Hospital in respiratory isolation. A spokesman for Denver's National Jewish Hospital, which specializes in respiratory disorders, said Wednesday that the man would be treated there. It was not clear when he would arrive, spokesman William Allstetter said. "The patient continues to feel well and be asymptomatic. He's currently still in isolation," Cetron said Wednesday. Citing privacy concerns, he said the CDC "cannot and won't talk further about this patient." The other passengers on the flights are not considered at high risk of infection because tests indicated the amount of TB bacteria in the man was low, Cetron said. But Gerberding noted that U.S. health officials have had little experience with this type of TB. It's possible it may have different transmission patterns, she said. "We're thankful the patient was not in a highly infectious state, but we know the risk of transmission isn't zero, even with the fact that he didn't have symptoms and didn't appear to be coughing," Gerberding said on ABC's "Good Morning America." "We've got to really look at the people closest to him, get them skin tested." Dr. Howard Njoo of the Public Health Agency of Canada said it appeared unlikely that the man spread the disease on the flight into Canada. Still the agency was working with U.S. officials to contact passengers who sat near him. Daniela Hupakova, a spokeswoman for the Czech airline CSA, said the flight crew underwent medical checks and are fine. The airline was contacting passengers and cooperating with Czech and foreign authorities, she said. Health officials in France have asked Air France-KLM to provide lists of passengers seated within two rows of the man, an airline spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity according to company policy. The man told the Journal-Constitution he was in Rome during his honeymoon when the CDC notified him of the new tests and told him to turn himself in to Italian authorities to be isolated and be treated. The CDC told him he couldn't fly aboard commercial airliners. "I thought to myself: You're nuts. I wasn't going to do that. They told me I had been put on the no-fly list and my passport was flagged," the man said. He told the newspaper he and his wife decided to sneak back into the U.S. through Canada. He said he voluntarily went to a New York hospital, then was flown by the CDC to Atlanta. He is not facing prosecution, health officials said. "I'm a very well-educated, successful, intelligent person," he told the paper. "This is insane to me that I have an armed guard outside my door when I've cooperated with everything other than the whole solitary-confinement-in-Italy thing." CDC officials told The Associated Press they could not immediately comment on the interview. Health officials said the man's wife tested negative for TB before the trip and is not considered a public health risk. They said they don't know how the Georgia man was infected. The quarantine order was the first since the government quarantined a patient with smallpox in 1963, according to the CDC. Tuberculosis is caused by germs that are spread from person to person through the air. It usually affects the lungs and can lead to symptoms such as chest pain and coughing up blood.

http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7726402.html FDA says warning shouldn't interrupt MedImmune flu vaccine production says warning shouldn't interrupt MedImmune flu vaccine production AM PDT AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - A warning issued to MedImmune Inc. over manufacturing issues at a United Kingdom plant shouldn't significantly disrupt company production of its nasal spray flu vaccine, federal health officials said Tuesday. The Gaithersburg, Md., company disclosed last week the Food and Drug Administration had issued the warning for deviating from standard practices in its manufacturing of bulk lots of its FluMist vaccine. MedImmune and the FDA both said they were trying to resolve the issue, which involved bacteria and mold contamination at a very early stage of vaccine production. The contamination did not affect finished lots of the vaccine, the FDA said. The warning means the FDA is delaying approving FluMist for use in children as young as 1 until MedImmune develops a plan and begins to take corrective action. FluMist already is approved for patients 5 to 49. In 2004, the nation's flu-shot supply was abruptly cut in half when British regulators shut down a Chiron Corp. factory because of contamination concerns. FDA stressed its concerns with MedImmune do not rise to that level. "It is different from Chiron in that again, we do not have a product failure at this point," Mary Malarkey, director of compliance and biologics quality in the FDA office that oversees vaccines, told reporters.
http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7747827.html US on mad cow: Don't test all cattle on mad cow: Don't test all cattle AM PDT AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - The Bush administration said Tuesday it will fight to keep meatpackers from testing all their animals for mad cow disease. The Agriculture Department tests less than 1 percent of slaughtered cows for the disease, which can be fatal to humans who eat tainted beef. But Kansas-based Creekstone Farms Premium Beef wants to test all of its cows. Larger meat companies feared that move because, if Creekstone tested its meat and advertised it as safe, they might have to perform the expensive test, too. The Agriculture Department regulates the test and argued that widespread testing could lead to a false positive that would harm the meat industry. A federal judge ruled in March that such tests must be allowed. U.S. District Judge James Robertson noted that Creekstone sought to use the same test the government relies on and said the government didn't have the authority to restrict it. The ruling was to take effect June 1, but the Agriculture Department said Tuesday it would appeal - effectively delaying the testing until the court challenge plays out. Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is linked to more than 150 human deaths worldwide, mostly in Britain. There have been three cases of mad cow disease in the U.S. The first, in December 2003 in Washington state, was in a cow that had been imported from Canada. The second, in 2005, was in a Texas-born cow. The third was confirmed last year in an Alabama cow.
http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7747757.html New UN testing guidance aims to identify more people with HIV UN testing guidance aims to identify more people with HIV AM PDT AM PDT LONDON (AP) - Health professionals should routinely offer to test people for HIV instead of waiting for patients to request it, according to new advice from the United Nations Wednesday. In making the recommendations, the World Health Organization and UNAIDS are underlining the need to identify the millions worldwide who need treatment. WHO estimates that approximately 80 percent of HIV-positive people in developing countries are currently unaware of their status. "If we are serious about ensuring universal access to drugs, there has to be a fundamental change in the approach to HIV testing," said Dr. Kevin De Cock, director of WHO's AIDS department. The UN now advises health workers to test patients for HIV as part of standard medical care, but only with the patient's informed consent. Yet there are questions about how the cash-strapped countries in Africa might adopt these guidelines. Of the estimated 40 million people living worldwide with HIV/AIDS, nearly 65 percent are in Africa. Because current estimates of the number of HIV/AIDS patients include people who don't know their status, experts do not expect the numbers to rise dramatically if more people are tested. Though universal testing will certainly identify more HIV-positive people needing lifesaving anti-retrovirals, there is already a long waiting list: Nearly 5 million people in sub-Saharan Africa are still without treatment. Identifying more AIDS patients whom countries cannot afford to treat threatens to create an even bigger backlog of people who know they are sick, but have no access to care. Most AIDS experts believe that increased HIV testing will help, even if the conditions are not perfect. "No one wants a situation where people find out they're HIV-positive and can't get anti-retroviral treatment," said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of HIV policy for the Kaiser Family Foundation. "But if we waited until everything was perfectly aligned, we would never respond." Another benefit of testing: Past studies also have shown that once people are aware that they are HIV-positive, they tend to practice safer sex - which could give prevention efforts a boost. Africa's weak health infrastructure, though, is a huge stumbling block. The continent urgently needs at least another 4 million health workers to fill the gap, according to WHO. Without doctors and nurses to administer the HIV tests or to provide the necessary treatment when patients are identified, such guidance will create even more stress for Africa's already fragile health systems. Still, the new testing procedures should mean that HIV patients are found earlier. "The biggest problem we have now is that our health care systems are overburdened with very sick people who come in too late," said Zackie Achmat, chairman of South Africa's Treatment Action Campaign. "These new guidelines are long overdue," said Achmat. "We cannot deal with the burden on the health care service if we don't prevent people from becoming so sick that they become a supreme burden on it," he said. Increased HIV testing and the treatment and infrastructure it ultimately entails will require more money, yet no new funds have been announced to help countries implement these policies. The UN estimates that the fight against AIDS in 2007-2008 requires $22 billion, and there is still a considerable shortfall. Last year, the deficit for global AIDS programs was about $6 billion. While health authorities would like to see the new UN recommendations adopted much will depend on whether countries decide to follow their advice. "I hope that countries start implementing this immediately," said WHO's De Cock. "But we know you can't just flip the switch and change everything in one day."
http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7747747.html Health agency warns water-pipe smoking may pose same risk as cigarettes agency warns water-pipe smoking may pose same risk as cigarettes AM PDT AM PDT GENEVA (AP) - Smoking from a water pipe may pose the same health risks as cigarettes, the World Health Organization said Tuesday, adding that there's a need for more research into the link between hookahs and a number of fatal illnesses. The hookah, used for centuries in North Africa, the Middle East and Central and South Asia, has become increasingly popular in the West, particularly among college students and young adults. Hookah bars have sprung up in cities across the United States, and groups of people often visit them to relax and talk while smoking from the water pipes. WHO, however, warned that using the water pipe to smoke tobacco is "not a safe alternative to cigarette smoking." In a seven-page document on the practice, the U.N. health agency said the rising popularity of hookahs is partly due to "unfounded assumptions" of safety and misleading commercial marketing. "Contrary to ancient lore and popular belief, the smoke that emerges from a water pipe contains numerous toxicants known to cause lung cancer, heart disease and other diseases," said WHO, which also issued a 50-page report Tuesday urging all countries to ban smoking in public buildings. WHO warned that using water pipes to consume shisha - a mixture of tobacco, molasses and fruit flavors - usually exposes a person to more smoke over a longer period of time than do cigarettes. The health agency said a person can inhale more than 100 times more smoke in a hookah session than in a single cigarette. By delivering nicotine, the water pipe can cause addiction. Preliminary research also indicates that hookah smoking may involve "some unique health risks," WHO said. A hookah typically consists of a bowl connected to a vase of water with a long tube and mouthpiece. The tobacco sits inside the bowl with a layer of foil and a hot coal on top. The shisha is not lit, instead heated by the charcoal, which users say produces a vapor different from smoke. "None of the accessories have been demonstrated to reduce smokers' exposure to toxins or risk of tobacco-related disease and death," WHO said. While further research is required, the health body said those exposed to secondhand hookah smoke appeared to be at risk of the same diseases as those exposed to cigarettes. WHO warned that hookah smoke could also increase the risk of adverse effects during pregnancy. Also Tuesday, WHO issued its strongest policy recommendations yet for controlling tobacco use, urging all countries to ban smoking at indoor workplaces and in public buildings. Tobacco use is the world's leading cause of preventable death, accounting for 10 percent of adult fatalities, according to WHO. It is responsible for 5.4 million deaths each year, a figure that is expected to rise to 8.3 million by 2030, the agency says. Increasing numbers of nonsmokers will also die unless governments take action, WHO said. It said governments of both rich and poor countries should declare all public indoor places smoke-free, by passing laws and actively enforcing measures to ensure that "everyone has a right to breathe clean air, free from tobacco smoke."
http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7735622.html Advanced Medical says that contact lens solution recall not due to manufacturing problem Medical says that contact lens solution recall not due to manufacturing problem PM PDT PM PDT ATLANTA (AP) - The company involved in a voluntary recall of a contact lens solution said Tuesday it stands by its product and blamed improper handling of contact lenses for the eye infections that forced the product to be pulled from the shelves. "What we're trying to handle right now ... is what the CDC hit us with," said James Mazzo, president and chief executive officer of Santa Ana, Calif.-based Advanced Medical Optics Inc., in a Tuesday morning conference call. Government officials Friday warned people to throw away AMO Complete Moisture Plus Multi-Purpose Solution, using for cleaning and storing soft contact lenses, after an investigation linked it to a rare eye infection. The solution seems to be a factor in cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis, a painful eye infection caused by a waterborne organism that, untreated, can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said. "It's not a manufacturing problem or a contamination issue," said Mazzo, who added that the infection, also called "AK," affects people who improperly handle contact lenses, such as disinfecting them with water or wearing them while swimming or showering. "AK is something the vast majority of contact lens users typically avoid by following their eye practitioner's advice," Mazzo said. "All of our products ... have always met and continue to meet FDA requirements. Moisture Plus does what it is required to do." CDC officials said they drew a link between the Advanced Medical Optics product and the infection because 58 percent of confirmed cases who wore soft contact lenses had used the solution in the month before onset of symptoms, and 39 percent had used only that solution. They calculated that wearers of soft contact lenses who had the infection were at least seven times more likely to have used AMO Complete Moisture Plus than healthy people who wear soft contact lenses. It's generally difficult to draw a strong statistical conclusion from a small number of cases, but in this case an association between the product and the infection was clear-cut, CDC officials said. Health officials will continue to investigate why the association exists. But in the interest of public health, they decided a warning was necessary, said Dr. Sharon Roy, the CDC epidemiologist who led the investigation. Chief Financial Officer Randy Meier said that the Moisture Plus products' $105.7 million in 2006 sales represent about 10 percent of the company's total consolidated sales. "We're still working through the details to determine how much of that revenue will be impacted by the recall," Meier said. "It is impossible to assess what path we'll take or what the impact will be to our future earnings." Meier said the company will update investors early next week. "While this recall is clearly a setback for our eye care business, none of our other products will be affected," Meier said. Shares of Advanced Medical Optics fell 13.7 percent to $34.69 Tuesday. The CDC and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are investigating 138 confirmed cases since January 2005. CDC officials said people should discard the solution, throw out their current contact lenses and toss away the lens storage case. All of them may harbor the infecting amoeba, said Michael Beach, team leader in the CDC's division of parasitic diseases. An estimated 85 percent of U.S. cases of Acanthamoeba keratitis occur in contact lens users, but it's extremely rare. The estimated prevalence is one to two cases per 1 million contact lens wearers. Contact lens wearers who practice proper lens care and people who don't wear contact lenses can still develop the infection. CDC information on Acanthamoeba
http://www.komotv.com/news/health/7756472.html Terminally ill woman to donate kidney on reality show ill woman to donate kidney on reality show PM PDT PM PDT By TOBY STERLING Associated Press Writer AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) - A Dutch reality show that claims to be trying to draw attention to a shortage of organ donors said Tuesday it would go ahead with a program in which a terminally ill woman will choose a contestant to receive one of her kidneys. The program, ''Big Donor Show,'' has been attacked as unethical and tasteless. One member of the Dutch parliament suggested the government should block Friday's broadcast. ''We know that this program is super controversial and some people will think it's tasteless, but we think the reality is even more shocking and tasteless: waiting for an organ is just like playing the lottery,'' Laurens Drillich, chairman of the BNN network, said in a statement. He said waiting lists in the Netherlands are more than four years long and 200 patients die annually for lack of a donor. The network identified the donor as ''Lisa,'' a 37-year-old woman with an inoperable brain tumor. During the show, she will hear interviews with the three candidates, their families and friends before choosing who will get her kidney. The show is being produced by Endemol NV, the creator of the ''Big Brother'' series. A spokeswoman for BNN said that there could be no guarantees the donation would actually be made, ''but the intention is'' Lisa's donation would be carried out before she died. That is because her wish to donate to a particular candidate ''wouldn't be valid anymore after her death'' under Dutch donation rules, Marieke Saly said. If Lisa does donate one kidney while living, the other kidney may still be awarded to someone else on a national donation waiting list under the country's organ allotment system. Viewers will be able to vote for the candidate they feel is most deserving via SMS text message, but ''Lisa will determine who the happy one is,'' BNN said in a statement. Saly could not say how much it will cost to send an SMS, but most TV programs charge around $1.35. Joop Atsma, a lawmaker of the ruling Christian Democrats, raised the issue in parliament, asking the government whether the program violated any law. ''Is it desirable that public broadcasting would go down this path, and is there no way to send a strong signal that we reject this?'' he said. Education Minister Ronald Plasterk, addressing parliament on behalf of the government because the health minister was ill, replied that there were serious questions about whether the transplant would actually go through as BNN has advertised it - but that there was no way to stop the program from airing. ''The information I have right now tells me that the program is unfitting and unethical, especially due to the competitive element, but it's up to program makers to make their choices,'' he said. ''The constitution forbids me from interfering in the content of programs: let there be no mistake about that, that would be censorship.'' He said that there were practical barriers. ''In every transplant the tissue of the donor and the patient must match as much as possible,'' Plasterk said. ''The doctors in this program can't make any concessions on that front.'' There also was doubt whether Lisa's organs could be donated at all because it might spread her cancer, he said. ''So it's very possible that in practical terms we're not talking about anything here, because it's possible this transplant can't take place,'' he said. Noting the shortage of donors, he said it was a good time for a debate on the question of what incentives to donate are ethical. He cited the example of a Dutch funeral home that is offering discounts to the families of people who were registered as donors, and an idea presented by the country's Kidney Institute to give registered donors preference on organ waiting lists.
