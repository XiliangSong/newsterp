Be So Quick to Hit the Road, One Program Says Physical Culture: For Those Who Sweat, Some Small Stuff Events like the LaSalle Bank Chicago Marathon have high finisher rates; some credit new training methods. During the first running boom three decades ago, aspirants embarked upon a six-day regimen of arduous runs hellbent on crossing the finish line in the fastest time possible. Hollow cheeks, hobbled feet and an overuse injury or two were badges of honor for the mostly middle-class men who tackled the 26.2-mile challenge. Their icon was Frank Shorter, a Yale-educated lawyer whose victory in the 1972 Olympic marathon ignited the mass running movement. Today’s marathoner is less likely to have been motivated by an Olympian than by . Her slow-but-steady completion of the 1994 Marine Corps Marathon in Washington, D.C., is considered the start of the second marathon boom, one that has dwarfed the first, and is far more democratic in nature. Ms. Winfrey was one of 277,000 marathon finishers nationwide in 1994; last year 410,000 runners crossed the line, according to Running USA, a nonprofit organization in Ventura, Calif., that keeps track of participatory running. The marathon has become an “everyman’s Everest,” said Amby Burfoot, the executive editor of Runner’s World magazine. Men, women, fledglings and fossils, of varying girth, are marathoners these days — in part because of the proliferation of training programs that make it, if not easier, at least less time-consuming to prepare. During his training for the Boston Marathon, which he won in 1968, Mr. Burfoot ran twice a day, seven days a week. Emil Zatopek, the great Czech runner who won the 1952 Olympic marathon (along with two other gold medals in the same Games), prepared by running mountain trails near his home in Moravia while carrying his wife, Dana, on his back. Contemporary marathon programs require neither twice-a-day workouts nor spouse-hauling. Indeed, the new watchwords of marathon training are moderation and specificity. Gone — for beginners, at least — are the six days a week of running routinely recommended in the 1970s. Absent, in most programs, are even consecutive days of running. Today, some popular schedules involve as little as three days a week of pounding the pavement. “It’s gone from being excessive training for what many would consider to be an excessive event to a very trimmed-down, less-is-more approach,” said Toby Tanser, a marathon coach in Manhattan and the author of “The Essential Guide to Running the New York City Marathon One of the leading less-is-more programs for running the marathon involves walking. It was developed by Jeff Galloway, a 1972 Olympian who believes that regularly timed walking intervals increase the likelihood of covering the 26.2 miles. In 2006, it worked for 18,000 Gallowalkers (as his followers are dismissively called by some old-school runners) who ran-walked their way to a marathon finish. At least half of last year’s marathoners used a minimal-mileage training plan, said Ryan Lamppa, a spokesman for Running USA. “The expectation has changed,” said Bill Pierce, the chairman of the health and exercise science department at Furman University in Greenville, S.C., and the creator of a popular three-day-a-week program. “It’s O.K. now to walk. It’s O.K. to finish over five hours. People have a completely different approach to the marathon.” Those people do not include the Kenyans, Ethiopians and other elite athletes from around the world who will be running in and perhaps winning the ING New York City Marathon on Nov. 4. The best will not be following a less-is-more approach. “This type of program is designed to get you to complete, not compete in, the marathon,” said Dr. William Roberts, the medical director of the Twin Cities Marathon in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Dr. Roberts endorses minimalist approaches. “They offer a lower risk for injury,” he said. Whether covering as little as 15 miles a week or as many as 100, the primary goal of all marathon programs is the same: to build your endurance to the point where you can cover 26.2 miles. Hence, the common denominator of every program is the weekly or every-other-week “long run” — a slow-paced run that starts at whatever distance you can now complete and, over months, grows longer. “The long run teaches the body how to deliver and utilize oxygen more efficiently,” said Carwyn Sharp, an exercise scientist with Wyle Laboratories, which conducts research on behalf of As the runs lengthen, the body adapts by creating more blood vessels to transport oxygen-rich blood to working muscles; by manufacturing more energy-producing mitochondria; and by more efficiently repairing the microscopic tears to muscle fibers that result from the extended effort. The long run is the one element, experts agree, that cannot be red-penciled out of a marathon program. But how long is long? Here, experts disagree. Many say 20 miles is sufficient. Others, like Mr. Galloway, recommend conquering at least the full marathon distance in training. Still, whatever the distance of the longest long run, novices can’t go from zero to 26 miles overnight, which is why most plans are at least 12 weeks long, and some last up to 30 weeks. What’s more, most coaches and exercise physiologists recommend against even starting a marathon program until you have regularly run shorter distances for a couple of years. Most programs also include at least one day of shorter but faster-paced running to improve efficiency; hill work not only to build leg strength, but also to prepare for steep elevation; and plenty of rest to allow the body to recover and rebuild. For many people, finding the time to train may be harder than actually training. Gordon Bakoulis, who competed in the United States Olympic Trials marathon four times, and now works for the New York Road Runners, the New York marathon’s organizers, says she has noticed a pattern among those who drop out before the race. “It’s not that they failed in the training,” Ms. Bakoulis said. “It’s just that they couldn’t manage the logistics. There were too many early-morning meetings at work, too many Saturday-morning soccer games. You can’t fake marathon training, especially the long runs.” But you can be reasonably certain that if you reach the starting line in one piece, you’ll finish: In last year’s New York City Marathon, 38,368 runners started and 37,869 finished — a 99 percent completion rate. Other major marathons, including the Marine Corps and Chicago’s, have similarly high finisher percentages — and it’s been that way for most of the last decade. What does that say about the various marathon training programs? “It says that they all work,” Ms. Bakoulis said. Basic Training looks at the latest thinking about conditioning for recreational sports.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/fashion/31CRITIC.html When You Just Need a Bespoke Chess Set You Just Need a Bespoke Chess Set Photographs by Robert Wright British retailer Asprey has moved from Trump Tower to its own space on Madison Avenue. It sells innumerable games, gifts, jewelry and accessories. Can Be Done,” the motto on the coat of arms awarded last year to Asprey, the British luxury house, in acknowledgment of 225 unbroken years of trading, refers to the ability of its skilled craftsmen to indulge its wealthy customers’ wildest flights of fancy. Madison Avenue (near 71st Street); (212) 688-1811 The serene and understated space, all creamy marble and dark wood, suggests a discreet and very expensive hotel. If you had never been to , you might be tempted to describe Asprey’s impeccable, nothing-is-too-much-trouble service as very British. Thankfully, it’s much, much better than that. A large gentleman’s bag based on an archival design originally created to carry polo mallets ($1,500 in calf) is sporty, stylish and masculine. Like most Asprey products, it can be ordered in the skin of your choice. Robert Wright instance, in 1973 Ringo Starr commissioned Asprey to create a gold and sterling silver chess set modeled from castings of his ringed fingers, bestowing a blessing for the bishop, forming a fist for the castle, etc. Today, anybody with a penchant for astronomically expensive conversation pieces can walk into the new Madison Avenue store and order a replica of this set or, budget and imagination permitting, create a unique army of chess pieces forged in the image of their own favorite anatomical part. But because the opening of this store marks the third time in under a decade that a new team of owners and managers have made a bid to turn this venerable brand into a force in 21st-century luxury retail, “It Can Be Done” can also be read as an invocation. Asprey’s move from its three-level flagship in the Trump Tower to a more intimate space on a prestigious stretch of Madison is central to this reinvention. While the former store, designed by , was beautiful, its location, in an edifice of nouveau-riche ostentation, and on a thoroughfare populated largely by tourists in synthetic fibers, didn’t exactly jibe with Asprey’s message of discreet British classicism. Accordingly, everything here has been scaled back, from the inventory to the interiors, where dark Art Deco-style cabinets evoke a golden age of aristocratic bright young things wielding monogrammed cocktail shakers, without making the kind of in-your-face design statement that might startle the horses or, more important, the local carriage trade. Last year, Asprey appointed Hakan Rosenius, formerly of Paul Smith, as its creative director. While the influence of Mr. Rosenius’s more aggressively Modernist aesthetic is evident, particularly in the home wares — a bold silver tea service ($45,000), with angular facets that recall the architecture of ; a chunky cut-crystal vase in the brand’s signature mauve ($5,400) — you sense that the Asprey style is still in transition. Nowhere is this clearer than in women’s ready-to-wear Pieces like a padded cotton jacket ($1,300) with inset elbows, apparently to allow greater leverage when swinging a polo mallet, are beautifully tailored and practical — at least for those given to equestrian sports or wild gesticulation — but entirely without glamour. An in-store brochure previewing Mr. Rosenius’s fall designs shows that things are set to change, though. Mixing ’20s and ’50s influences, the new collection balances refinement with a youthful sexuality. And the unexpected accessorizing — red belts with khaki buckles; vertiginous violet patent stilettos — signals an assured fashion sensibility at work. It was that I was privy to a demonstration of the Asprey scarf belt, a looped and buckled contrivance (from $100) that magically transforms scarves into belts. At first the charming saleswoman was all blithe confidence, happily folding and threading. (“Now this pops under here!”) But it soon became obvious that things were not going to plan. A professional, she dutifully wrapped the misshapen object around her waist — “Voilà!” And even gave a spin. “It does come with instructions,” she assured me when she had once again come to a rest. Still, the scarf belt is a clever idea, and such ingenious touches can be found throughout the store. The standard handle of the 167 alligator bag ($13,000) can be snapped off and swapped for wood, tortoiseshell or mother-of-pearl at a whim ($400 a handle). And Purple Water ($50 to $220), Asprey’s modishly unisex fragrance — “We prefer ‘shared,’ ” a salesman shared as he spritzed — has a cap that is pushed to spray or twisted to splash, according to the user’s gender or preference. Nothing, however, beats the picnic set (price on request) that the company will put into production next year. Based on a 1990 commission from an American, the rattan hamper, the size of a small trailer, opens to reveal not only crockery, linen, cutlery and glasses for 16, but also a barbecue and a mahogany campaign-style dining suite. During its heyday, Asprey was the place where the British royal family shopped for wedding and christening gifts, so it is not surprising that the Madison Avenue store offers the kind of presents you give when you’re out to impress, from china to Moroccan-bound first editions. The rabbit adorning sterling silver rattles, bookends and egg cups ($275 to $975) is sweetly aerodynamic, like the love child of Jeff Koons’s Neo-Geo bunny and Peter Cottontail. BUT for the ultimate gift-giving, look no further than the first floor jewelry department. After drunken spats, Richard Burton routinely appeased Liz Taylor with an Asprey jewel, and call me cheap, but with a daisy chain bracelet, every petal a diamond, merrily a-twinkle on my wrist ($120,000), I might also be prepared to overlook a little bad behavior. Despite the extravagant pricing, Asprey’s service is not only hauteur-free, but positively effusive. At one point I asked a staff member about an item stocked and she all but carried me up the stairs on her shoulders. And as I perused the jewelry cabinets, the sales team led me to feel that my popping in had really brightened their day. Soon I was trying on an Architecture ring, a gorgeous pavé diamond and amethyst knuckle-duster ($10,250), as casually as if I were shopping at Girl Props. Whether the historic house of Asprey will rise again, like the phoenix on its coat of arms, into the thin-aired stratosphere of jet-set luxury remains to be seen. But from its understated new store with its impeccable service to its introduction of more fashion-focused design, it is doing a lot right. While I was there, a staff member told me that just that morning they had sent a diamond ring to a customer for approval. By all accounts it was a comely bauble, its price a mere $2.5 million.

We pester our children not to do it; we take pride in the multitasking that ensures we never do it; and we bristle at our fellow workers, shop clerks and just about anyone else who slows us down by doing it. kind of work environment is most conducive to happy, productive workers? But we all do it. One of my favorite books as a child was “Cheaper by the Dozen,” the story of Frank B. Gilbreth Jr., who introduced the idea of efficiency to 20th-century America. His time-shaving techniques ran the gamut from a new way of laying bricks to a quicker method of buttoning his vest (bottom to top, saving four seconds). Inspired, I slept in my clothes for a few nights back then to save time dressing for school, though I don’t think that’s exactly what the man had in mind. I can only imagine what Mr. Gilbreth would have made of the modern workplace, with its endless possibilities for distraction. His 21st-century counterparts are an army of product researchers, academics and personal improvement gurus, who all agree we are frittering valuable minutes, hours and even entire days, though they can’t agree on how many. American workers, on average, spend 45 hours a week at work, but describe 16 of those hours as “unproductive,” according to a study by Microsoft. America Online and , in turn, determined that workers actually work a total of three days a week, wasting the other two. And Steve Pavlina, whose Web site ( ) describes him as a “personal development expert” and who keeps incremental logs of how he spends each working day, urging others to do the same, finds that we actually work only about 1.5 hours a day. “The average full-time worker doesn’t even start doing real work until 11:00 a.m.,” he writes, “and begins to wind down around 3:30 p.m.” The experts disagree on how we are wasting all this time. The AOL survey says time is lost to surfing the Internet (given the source, that is either self-congratulatory or self-incriminating). The Microsoft survey pointed to worthless meetings. Respondents said they spent 5.6 hours each week in meetings and 71 percent of them thought that those meetings “aren’t productive.” Searching through clutter is another diversion, says Peggy Duncan, a “personal productivity coach” in Atlanta, who maintains that rifling though messy desks wastes 1.5 hours a day. But wait, you say, you spend all your time working. Your boss is a slave driver. You’re the only one left in the office after the downsizing, meaning you are doing the work of three people. Well, there are numbers that also support this situation. The average professional workweek has expanded steadily over the last 10 years, according to the Center for Work Life Policy, and logging 70-plus hours is now the norm at the top. And there are those of us who work even when we are at home, driving or worse. A poll conducted for Staples found that almost half of the small-business managers in the United States work during time meant for family, while 49 percent make business calls and check e-mail messages while behind the wheel; 18 percent read e-mail messages in the bathroom. So how to reconcile the seemingly conflicting trends — the fact that we are working harder and wasting more time? A crotchety boss might say that we’re working longer because we’re wasting time, but the opposite may also be true. We are wasting time because we are working harder. “The longer you work, the less efficient you are,” said Bob Kustka, the founder of Fusion Factor, a productivity and time-management consulting firm in Norwell, Mass. He says workers are like athletes in that they are most efficient in concentrated bursts. Elite athletes “play a set of tennis, a down of football or an inning of baseball and have a pause in between,” he says. Working energy, like physical energy, “is best used in spurts where we work hard on a few focused activities and then take a brief respite,” he says. And those respites look an awful lot like wasting time. It has taken me years to make tentative peace with my stops and starts during work. Every morning I vow to become a morning person, starting full speed out of the gate. And every morning I daydream, shuffle papers, read e-mail messages and visit blogs, and somehow it is time for lunch. Then, at about 2 p.m., a sense of urgency kicks in, and I write steadily, until about 5 or 6, when I revert to the little-of-this, some-of-that style of the morning. Over the years I have come to see that the hours away from the writing are the time when the real work gets done. When a paragraph turns itself this way and that in a corner of my brain even while my fingers are buying books on . What appears to be wasted time is really jell time. This redefinition only makes me feel a little less guilty. Mr. Kustka assures me that the problem is not the three to four hours of concentrated work I do each day, but rather the outmoded paradigm against which I measure that work. Productivity was directly related to time back when Mr. Gilbreth was measuring things, he said, but the connection is less direct today. “We are in a knowledge-worker world,” he says. “If you were building me a building, I could measure the number of bricks. If you were loading a truck, I could measure the number of boxes. But I can’t simply count your words. That doesn’t measure quality.” I didn’t have the heart to tell him that word count is how nearly all freelance writers are paid. Instead I focused on his more general point that it shouldn’t matter whether I wrote these words in hours or days, at a desk or on a deck — the end result is all that counts. “The old thinking says ‘the longer it takes, the harder you’re working,” says Lynne Lancaster, a founder of BridgeWorks, a business consulting firm. “The new thinking is ‘if I know the job inside and out and I’m done faster than everyone else then why can’t I go home early?’ ” A few companies are taking the concept of “watch what I produce, not how I produce it” even further. At the headquarters of Best Buy in Minneapolis, for instance, the hot policy of the moment is called ROWE, short for Results Only Work Environment. There workers can come in at four or leave at noon, or head for the movies in the middle of the day, or not even show up at all. It’s the work that matters, not the method. And, not incidentally, both output and job satisfaction have jumped wherever ROWE is tried. In other words, what looks like wasting time from where you sit, could be a whirl of creative thought from where I sit. And, with due respect to Mr. Gilbreth, all the energy that’s been poured into trying to force everyone to work at the same pace and in the same way — it seems that’s the real waste of time.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/fashion/31sarkozy.html Christine Poujoulat/Agence France-Presse President Nicolas Sarkozy of France with his wife, C&#233;cilia, last July. photograph by Philippe Warrin/SIPA Nicolas Sarkozy and his family. TO their admirers, the Sarkozys are the French Kennedys: the president is outdoorsy and athletic, the first lady beautiful and designer-dressed, the passel of children smiling and photogenic. To their detractors, the Sarkozys are more like Italy’s former Prime Minister and his clan: showy, vulgar, acquisitive, more nouveaux riche than old money. ’s arrival at the Élysée Palace two weeks ago already has brought radical change, including what the French call the “people-ization” of the presidency. Gone are the much older and more formal Chiracs, with their discretion, impeccable manners, old-fashioned style and easy slow motion. In their place is a 52-year-old president, armed with naked ambition, a hyperactive style and close friendships with some of France’s richest men. By his side — episodically — is his somewhat mysterious 49-year-old wife, Cécilia, who left him for another man in the summer of 2005 and then returned several months later. She was absent during most of the campaign and didn’t bother to vote in the second and decisive round of the election. Then there are the children: two daughters (Judith, 22; Jeanne-Marie, 20) from her first marriage, two sons (Pierre, 22; Jean, 21) from his and one (Louis, 10) whom they had together. At least for now, some of the fiercest critics of Mr. Sarkozy are dazzled by his energy and hopeful that he will fulfill even some of his promises for reforming France quickly. Paradoxically, the French are both ready to put the most positive spin on the first family’s “normalcy” and eager to gossip about the most lurid rumors. Speculating about the Sarkozys has become a popular parlor game at Paris dinner parties. “They look like an ordinary French family — divorced, remarried — with all their problems out in the open,” said Marie-Pierre Lannelongue, a senior editor at French Elle. “Before when the president was unfaithful everyone knew about it but no one talked about it. Here is a great drama of love with its ups and downs. Everyone’s talking about the first lady: Were there suicide attempts? Why did she come back? We don’t know exactly but we want to know.” Stéphane Bern, a journalist and specialist in French royalty and society, calls it the “de-sacred-ization” of the French presidency, adding that he is reserving judgment over whether all this change will be better or worse for France. Activism is the leitmotif of this presidency. Mr. Sarkozy has been described as the “lapin Duracell” — the Energizer bunny — of politics. Perhaps a more apt comparison is Alice in Wonderland’s white rabbit, perpetually rushing to a very important date. Since taking office, Mr. Sarkozy has already traveled to Berlin and Brussels, visited hospital personnel in Dunkirk, eaten with workers in the staff cafeteria of Airbus in Toulouse and campaigned in Normandy for upcoming parliamentary elections. He has received dozens of visitors, from French union leaders to the emir of Qatar. He interrupted his jogging during his two trips to Brégançon, the official presidential summer residence, to shake hands with the locals. Today, he makes a brief trip to Madrid. Photographers embedded with him have captured his jogging in detail. One of the first iconic photographs of his presidency is of him running up the steps of the Élysée Palace in Nike jogging shorts and sneakers. The cover of last week’s Le Point was a photo of Mr. Sarkozy jogging with Prime Minister François Fillon, who is also a race-car driver and a mountain climber. Indeed, Mr. Sarkozy uses the informal “tu” instead of the formal “vous” with colleagues and journalists alike. But two weeks ago, when Mr. Sarkozy addressed Alain Juppé, one of his senior ministers and a former prime minister in the formal Chirac era, with “tu,” Mr. Juppé seemed so flummoxed that he replied in a convoluted formulation, avoiding both “you” forms. Mr. Sarkozy’s style has translated into a historically high popularity rating. According to a poll published Sunday in Le Journal du Dimanche, 65 percent of those questioned are “satisfied” with their new president, the highest early rating since the beginning of the Fifth Republic in 1958, according to the polling institute IFOP. Much of his popularity is driven by the national media. “Kennedy has come back,” wrote Le Point. “He’s named Sarkozy. Never has a president shown such a relaxed nature, such an absence of complexes.” SATURDAY PROFILE; Sarkozy's Top Diplomat Is the Undiplomatic Non-Sarkozy Sarkozy Chooses Campaign Aide as New French Premier to Help Smooth Way for Reform Plan The Sarkozy of the Future Jousts With the Chirac of the Past Look to Airbus For Clues To Sarkozy

Other major marathons, including the Marine Corps and Chicago’s, have similarly high finisher percentages — and it’s been that way for most of the last decade. What does that say about the various marathon training programs? “It says that they all work,” Ms. Bakoulis said.

They weren’t wrong. He oozed star status dressed in a graphite-colored Miu Miu suit, a Prada classic shirt and Martin Margiela sneakers. “I’ve had women cry when they’ve met me or break into a sweat so bad I couldn’t apply makeup because it kept slipping off,” Mr. Longo said as he greeted those who had come to meet him and sample or purchase products from his makeup line. In a society where lipstick is like oxygen and eyeliner is essential to mental health, makeup artists have become beauty idols. No one is asking to have her breast signed with a high-end lipstick, but women will wait hours for boldface cosmetologists like Mr. Longo, Laura Mercier and Bobbi Brown to arrive for a personal appearance. Montana Rader, 46, a stylist with pale skin, freckles and an haircut, was among the women who gave Mr. Longo a welcome worthy of a rock star. “I never go to these things,” she said, “but he’s sexy and chic and reminds me of Bryan Ferry, and I like his makeup.” After she had been in the chair for 50 minutes, Ms. Rader bought more than $800 in products. Some were for her; most were a gift for her niece who was receiving a makeup lesson for her prom. For Sally Gale, meeting Mr. Longo was a 14th birthday gift from her parents. “I was really nervous about meeting him because he’s so famous,” she said, as Mr. Longo applied blush to her cheeks. “All my friends knew who he is and that seeing him would be cool.” For stores, personal appearances are big business: sales double, traffic is heavy, new customers are made.

Mr. Longo was there to unveil his Riviera Light color collection for summer. “Customers tell me what’s working and what’s not,” Mr. Longo said, his index finger pressed gently on a fan’s brow. “My job is to make her beauty life easier.” The setup was simple. Eight stools were placed around two aluminum tables, and eight Longo artists stood ready to execute his style and technique.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/fashion/31swim.html you look at recent publications like “The Bikini Book” or “The Playmate Book: Six Decades of Centerfolds,” the barriers to wearing next to nothing seemed lower in the 1960s and 1970s. Bodies were softer, more varied, natural — breasts an average C — and Playboy liked to show a girl’s tan line, as if to suggest she had just come from the beach and innocently stripped. Regard model wearing Dolce & Gabbana&#146;s leopard print. Now that the female body has undergone a turbocharging — pumped and aggressively perky, with a spray-on tan — you can feel crazily short-strawed in the search for a new bathing suit. It’s not that your body isn’t good enough to be seen on a towel on Nantucket, or that you can’t find a suit from among the thousands sold online and in stores. But there is a definite mental hurdle between what you know looks genuinely sexy and what the rest of the world considers hot, which is a cross between a Gucci model and a porn star. Last week, at the encouragement of my editors, I threw myself into two days of bathing-suit shopping. I always say: I was born to endure. But their interest in my potential humiliation (was that a laugh track I heard in the Saks dressing room once the saleswoman deigned to unlock the door, the glare that of a police klieg light?) interested me. Was the assignment a form of editorial sport? Was I cruelly being recognized as the Every Woman, with body issues? (O.K.: flab.) Well. I boarded the escalator at Saks. I rode and rode until I reached the plus-size fashion floor (endure!), where I took another escalator to the lingerie department. The placement of swimsuits in department stores is intriguing. Plainly, the reason merchants put them so far from the front door is that they don’t generate the kinds of sales cosmetics and handbags do. But women don’t think like merchants. They want what is new the moment it enters their minds — and I hate to point out the obvious, but in the time it takes to reach the top floor of a busy department store, you can order the garment online. Of all the stores I visited, only Bloomingdale’s had its swimsuits next to other summer fashion. The Chanel boutique in SoHo posed a different challenge. When I asked a saleswoman if they had any swimsuits — I remembered some adorable ones on the runway — she said the only ones they had were on the mannequins in the windows. Maybe she expected me to climb into the window and struggle with the mannequin myself, but she didn’t budge. I left, wondering how she would have reacted if I had arrived in a limo and broken her nail when I dropped my big Fendi buckle bag on the counter. (A Chanel spokeswoman said its swimsuits were very popular this season and had sold out early. “However, the bigger miss was the opportunity to respond with the level of customer service that we strive for,” she said.) At Saks, I grabbed any suit I thought might look good. Buying a bathing suit is a lot like buying a wedding gown: usually the one you choose is a lot different from the one you pictured in your bedroom. I picked out a coral-and-pink micro-check Missoni one piece ($330); an olive green Lisa Curran tankini ($145); a Dolce & Gabbana leopard-print one piece ($495), and black shirred Miracle Suit ($132), which promised to banish 10 pounds in 10 seconds, and I’ll tell you right now it did no such thing. The fabric of the Missoni was heavenly but offered absolutely no support or shape. Maybe if I was sitting on a volcanic island with 20 ripening Italian women in their Missonis, it would work, but what were the chances of that? The tankini, on the other hand, made me think I should have a tattoo and boyfriend named Billy Ray. I loved the Dolce suit. The leopard print was flattering and fun, and the high cut lengthened my legs. The only trouble was, I couldn’t manage to keep up the top, which consisted of two foam-lined cups rimmed in a black ruffle. Without a strap, no pair of breasts, big or small, was going to stop those cups from dropping down like an airplane seat tray. It’s strictly a posing suit.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/fashion/31CRITIC.html?ex=1338264000&en=3038f404e6b5aefd&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss When You Just Need a Bespoke Chess Set You Just Need a Bespoke Chess Set Photographs by Robert Wright British retailer Asprey has moved from Trump Tower to its own space on Madison Avenue. It sells innumerable games, gifts, jewelry and accessories. Can Be Done,” the motto on the coat of arms awarded last year to Asprey, the British luxury house, in acknowledgment of 225 unbroken years of trading, refers to the ability of its skilled craftsmen to indulge its wealthy customers’ wildest flights of fancy. Madison Avenue (near 71st Street); (212) 688-1811 The serene and understated space, all creamy marble and dark wood, suggests a discreet and very expensive hotel. If you had never been to , you might be tempted to describe Asprey’s impeccable, nothing-is-too-much-trouble service as very British. Thankfully, it’s much, much better than that. A large gentleman’s bag based on an archival design originally created to carry polo mallets ($1,500 in calf) is sporty, stylish and masculine. Like most Asprey products, it can be ordered in the skin of your choice. Robert Wright instance, in 1973 Ringo Starr commissioned Asprey to create a gold and sterling silver chess set modeled from castings of his ringed fingers, bestowing a blessing for the bishop, forming a fist for the castle, etc. Today, anybody with a penchant for astronomically expensive conversation pieces can walk into the new Madison Avenue store and order a replica of this set or, budget and imagination permitting, create a unique army of chess pieces forged in the image of their own favorite anatomical part. But because the opening of this store marks the third time in under a decade that a new team of owners and managers have made a bid to turn this venerable brand into a force in 21st-century luxury retail, “It Can Be Done” can also be read as an invocation. Asprey’s move from its three-level flagship in the Trump Tower to a more intimate space on a prestigious stretch of Madison is central to this reinvention. While the former store, designed by , was beautiful, its location, in an edifice of nouveau-riche ostentation, and on a thoroughfare populated largely by tourists in synthetic fibers, didn’t exactly jibe with Asprey’s message of discreet British classicism. Accordingly, everything here has been scaled back, from the inventory to the interiors, where dark Art Deco-style cabinets evoke a golden age of aristocratic bright young things wielding monogrammed cocktail shakers, without making the kind of in-your-face design statement that might startle the horses or, more important, the local carriage trade. Last year, Asprey appointed Hakan Rosenius, formerly of Paul Smith, as its creative director. While the influence of Mr. Rosenius’s more aggressively Modernist aesthetic is evident, particularly in the home wares — a bold silver tea service ($45,000), with angular facets that recall the architecture of ; a chunky cut-crystal vase in the brand’s signature mauve ($5,400) — you sense that the Asprey style is still in transition. Nowhere is this clearer than in women’s ready-to-wear Pieces like a padded cotton jacket ($1,300) with inset elbows, apparently to allow greater leverage when swinging a polo mallet, are beautifully tailored and practical — at least for those given to equestrian sports or wild gesticulation — but entirely without glamour. An in-store brochure previewing Mr. Rosenius’s fall designs shows that things are set to change, though. Mixing ’20s and ’50s influences, the new collection balances refinement with a youthful sexuality. And the unexpected accessorizing — red belts with khaki buckles; vertiginous violet patent stilettos — signals an assured fashion sensibility at work. It was that I was privy to a demonstration of the Asprey scarf belt, a looped and buckled contrivance (from $100) that magically transforms scarves into belts. At first the charming saleswoman was all blithe confidence, happily folding and threading. (“Now this pops under here!”) But it soon became obvious that things were not going to plan. A professional, she dutifully wrapped the misshapen object around her waist — “Voilà!” And even gave a spin. “It does come with instructions,” she assured me when she had once again come to a rest. Still, the scarf belt is a clever idea, and such ingenious touches can be found throughout the store. The standard handle of the 167 alligator bag ($13,000) can be snapped off and swapped for wood, tortoiseshell or mother-of-pearl at a whim ($400 a handle). And Purple Water ($50 to $220), Asprey’s modishly unisex fragrance — “We prefer ‘shared,’ ” a salesman shared as he spritzed — has a cap that is pushed to spray or twisted to splash, according to the user’s gender or preference. Nothing, however, beats the picnic set (price on request) that the company will put into production next year. Based on a 1990 commission from an American, the rattan hamper, the size of a small trailer, opens to reveal not only crockery, linen, cutlery and glasses for 16, but also a barbecue and a mahogany campaign-style dining suite. During its heyday, Asprey was the place where the British royal family shopped for wedding and christening gifts, so it is not surprising that the Madison Avenue store offers the kind of presents you give when you’re out to impress, from china to Moroccan-bound first editions. The rabbit adorning sterling silver rattles, bookends and egg cups ($275 to $975) is sweetly aerodynamic, like the love child of Jeff Koons’s Neo-Geo bunny and Peter Cottontail. BUT for the ultimate gift-giving, look no further than the first floor jewelry department. After drunken spats, Richard Burton routinely appeased Liz Taylor with an Asprey jewel, and call me cheap, but with a daisy chain bracelet, every petal a diamond, merrily a-twinkle on my wrist ($120,000), I might also be prepared to overlook a little bad behavior. Despite the extravagant pricing, Asprey’s service is not only hauteur-free, but positively effusive. At one point I asked a staff member about an item stocked and she all but carried me up the stairs on her shoulders. And as I perused the jewelry cabinets, the sales team led me to feel that my popping in had really brightened their day. Soon I was trying on an Architecture ring, a gorgeous pavé diamond and amethyst knuckle-duster ($10,250), as casually as if I were shopping at Girl Props. Whether the historic house of Asprey will rise again, like the phoenix on its coat of arms, into the thin-aired stratosphere of jet-set luxury remains to be seen. But from its understated new store with its impeccable service to its introduction of more fashion-focused design, it is doing a lot right. While I was there, a staff member told me that just that morning they had sent a diamond ring to a customer for approval. By all accounts it was a comely bauble, its price a mere $2.5 million. Who knows? Maybe it can indeed be done.

TO their admirers, the Sarkozys are the French Kennedys: the president is outdoorsy and athletic, the first lady beautiful and designer-dressed, the passel of children smiling and photogenic. To their detractors, the Sarkozys are more like Italy’s former Prime Minister and his clan: showy, vulgar, acquisitive, more nouveaux riche than old money. ’s arrival at the Élysée Palace two weeks ago already has brought radical change, including what the French call the “people-ization” of the presidency. Gone are the much older and more formal Chiracs, with their discretion, impeccable manners, old-fashioned style and easy slow motion. In their place is a 52-year-old president, armed with naked ambition, a hyperactive style and close friendships with some of France’s richest men. By his side — episodically — is his somewhat mysterious 49-year-old wife, Cécilia, who left him for another man in the summer of 2005 and then returned several months later. She was absent during most of the campaign and didn’t bother to vote in the second and decisive round of the election. Then there are the children: two daughters (Judith, 22; Jeanne-Marie, 20) from her first marriage, two sons (Pierre, 22; Jean, 21) from his and one (Louis, 10) whom they had together. At least for now, some of the fiercest critics of Mr. Sarkozy are dazzled by his energy and hopeful that he will fulfill even some of his promises for reforming France quickly. Paradoxically, the French are both ready to put the most positive spin on the first family’s “normalcy” and eager to gossip about the most lurid rumors. Speculating about the Sarkozys has become a popular parlor game at Paris dinner parties. “They look like an ordinary French family — divorced, remarried — with all their problems out in the open,” said Marie-Pierre Lannelongue, a senior editor at French Elle. “Before when the president was unfaithful everyone knew about it but no one talked about it. Here is a great drama of love with its ups and downs. Everyone’s talking about the first lady: Were there suicide attempts? Why did she come back? We don’t know exactly but we want to know.” Stéphane Bern, a journalist and specialist in French royalty and society, calls it the “de-sacred-ization” of the French presidency, adding that he is reserving judgment over whether all this change will be better or worse for France. Activism is the leitmotif of this presidency. Mr. Sarkozy has been described as the “lapin Duracell” — the Energizer bunny — of politics. Perhaps a more apt comparison is Alice in Wonderland’s white rabbit, perpetually rushing to a very important date. Since taking office, Mr. Sarkozy has already traveled to Berlin and Brussels, visited hospital personnel in Dunkirk, eaten with workers in the staff cafeteria of Airbus in Toulouse and campaigned in Normandy for upcoming parliamentary elections. He has received dozens of visitors, from French union leaders to the emir of Qatar. He interrupted his jogging during his two trips to Brégançon, the official presidential summer residence, to shake hands with the locals. Today, he makes a brief trip to Madrid. Photographers embedded with him have captured his jogging in detail. One of the first iconic photographs of his presidency is of him running up the steps of the Élysée Palace in Nike jogging shorts and sneakers. The cover of last week’s Le Point was a photo of Mr. Sarkozy jogging with Prime Minister François Fillon, who is also a race-car driver and a mountain climber. Indeed, Mr. Sarkozy uses the informal “tu” instead of the formal “vous” with colleagues and journalists alike. But two weeks ago, when Mr. Sarkozy addressed Alain Juppé, one of his senior ministers and a former prime minister in the formal Chirac era, with “tu,” Mr. Juppé seemed so flummoxed that he replied in a convoluted formulation, avoiding both “you” forms. Mr. Sarkozy’s style has translated into a historically high popularity rating. According to a poll published Sunday in Le Journal du Dimanche, 65 percent of those questioned are “satisfied” with their new president, the highest early rating since the beginning of the Fifth Republic in 1958, according to the polling institute IFOP. Much of his popularity is driven by the national media. “Kennedy has come back,” wrote Le Point. “He’s named Sarkozy. Never has a president shown such a relaxed nature, such an absence of complexes.” SATURDAY PROFILE; Sarkozy's Top Diplomat Is the Undiplomatic Non-Sarkozy Sarkozy Chooses Campaign Aide as New French Premier to Help Smooth Way for Reform Plan The Sarkozy of the Future Jousts With the Chirac of the Past Look to Airbus For Clues To Sarkozy That Solves Problems for the World&#8217;s Poor Big Disparities in Judging of Asylum Cases Contributor: Physician, Upgrade Thyself Op-Ed Contributor: Fliers and No Plan B Economix: Fault Harsh Methods in Interrogation Push for Big Subsidies for Coal Process Google Deal Said to Bring U.S. Scrutiny Iraqi Refugees, in Dire Straits, Turn to the Sex Trade in Syria Giuliani Tempers Tough Image on Campaign Justices' Ruling Limits Suits on Pay Disparity Hitherto Staunch G.O.P.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/fashion/31work.html Well Spent Well Spent time gets a bad rap. We pester our children not to do it; we take pride in the multitasking that ensures we never do it; and we bristle at our fellow workers, shop clerks and just about anyone else who slows us down by doing it. kind of work environment is most conducive to happy, productive workers? But we all do it. One of my favorite books as a child was “Cheaper by the Dozen,” the story of Frank B. Gilbreth Jr., who introduced the idea of efficiency to 20th-century America. His time-shaving techniques ran the gamut from a new way of laying bricks to a quicker method of buttoning his vest (bottom to top, saving four seconds). Inspired, I slept in my clothes for a few nights back then to save time dressing for school, though I don’t think that’s exactly what the man had in mind. I can only imagine what Mr. Gilbreth would have made of the modern workplace, with its endless possibilities for distraction. His 21st-century counterparts are an army of product researchers, academics and personal improvement gurus, who all agree we are frittering valuable minutes, hours and even entire days, though they can’t agree on how many. American workers, on average, spend 45 hours a week at work, but describe 16 of those hours as “unproductive,” according to a study by Microsoft. America Online and , in turn, determined that workers actually work a total of three days a week, wasting the other two. And Steve Pavlina, whose Web site ( ) describes him as a “personal development expert” and who keeps incremental logs of how he spends each working day, urging others to do the same, finds that we actually work only about 1.5 hours a day. “The average full-time worker doesn’t even start doing real work until 11:00 a.m.,” he writes, “and begins to wind down around 3:30 p.m.” The experts disagree on how we are wasting all this time. The AOL survey says time is lost to surfing the Internet (given the source, that is either self-congratulatory or self-incriminating). The Microsoft survey pointed to worthless meetings. Respondents said they spent 5.6 hours each week in meetings and 71 percent of them thought that those meetings “aren’t productive.” Searching through clutter is another diversion, says Peggy Duncan, a “personal productivity coach” in Atlanta, who maintains that rifling though messy desks wastes 1.5 hours a day. But wait, you say, you spend all your time working. Your boss is a slave driver. You’re the only one left in the office after the downsizing, meaning you are doing the work of three people. Well, there are numbers that also support this situation. The average professional workweek has expanded steadily over the last 10 years, according to the Center for Work Life Policy, and logging 70-plus hours is now the norm at the top. And there are those of us who work even when we are at home, driving or worse. A poll conducted for Staples found that almost half of the small-business managers in the United States work during time meant for family, while 49 percent make business calls and check e-mail messages while behind the wheel; 18 percent read e-mail messages in the bathroom. So how to reconcile the seemingly conflicting trends — the fact that we are working harder and wasting more time? A crotchety boss might say that we’re working longer because we’re wasting time, but the opposite may also be true. We are wasting time because we are working harder. “The longer you work, the less efficient you are,” said Bob Kustka, the founder of Fusion Factor, a productivity and time-management consulting firm in Norwell, Mass. He says workers are like athletes in that they are most efficient in concentrated bursts. Elite athletes “play a set of tennis, a down of football or an inning of baseball and have a pause in between,” he says. Working energy, like physical energy, “is best used in spurts where we work hard on a few focused activities and then take a brief respite,” he says. And those respites look an awful lot like wasting time. It has taken me years to make tentative peace with my stops and starts during work. Every morning I vow to become a morning person, starting full speed out of the gate. And every morning I daydream, shuffle papers, read e-mail messages and visit blogs, and somehow it is time for lunch. Then, at about 2 p.m., a sense of urgency kicks in, and I write steadily, until about 5 or 6, when I revert to the little-of-this, some-of-that style of the morning. Over the years I have come to see that the hours away from the writing are the time when the real work gets done. When a paragraph turns itself this way and that in a corner of my brain even while my fingers are buying books on . What appears to be wasted time is really jell time. This redefinition only makes me feel a little less guilty. Mr. Kustka assures me that the problem is not the three to four hours of concentrated work I do each day, but rather the outmoded paradigm against which I measure that work. Productivity was directly related to time back when Mr. Gilbreth was measuring things, he said, but the connection is less direct today. “We are in a knowledge-worker world,” he says. “If you were building me a building, I could measure the number of bricks. If you were loading a truck, I could measure the number of boxes. But I can’t simply count your words. That doesn’t measure quality.” I didn’t have the heart to tell him that word count is how nearly all freelance writers are paid. Instead I focused on his more general point that it shouldn’t matter whether I wrote these words in hours or days, at a desk or on a deck — the end result is all that counts. “The old thinking says ‘the longer it takes, the harder you’re working,” says Lynne Lancaster, a founder of BridgeWorks, a business consulting firm. “The new thinking is ‘if I know the job inside and out and I’m done faster than everyone else then why can’t I go home early?’ ” A few companies are taking the concept of “watch what I produce, not how I produce it” even further. At the headquarters of Best Buy in Minneapolis, for instance, the hot policy of the moment is called ROWE, short for Results Only Work Environment. There workers can come in at four or leave at noon, or head for the movies in the middle of the day, or not even show up at all. It’s the work that matters, not the method. And, not incidentally, both output and job satisfaction have jumped wherever ROWE is tried. In other words, what looks like wasting time from where you sit, could be a whirl of creative thought from where I sit. And, with due respect to Mr. Gilbreth, all the energy that’s been poured into trying to force everyone to work at the same pace and in the same way — it seems that’s the real waste of time.

Bodies were softer, more varied, natural — breasts an average C — and Playboy liked to show a girl’s tan line, as if to suggest she had just come from the beach and innocently stripped. Regard model wearing Dolce & Gabbana&#146;s leopard print. Now that the female body has undergone a turbocharging — pumped and aggressively perky, with a spray-on tan — you can feel crazily short-strawed in the search for a new bathing suit. It’s not that your body isn’t good enough to be seen on a towel on Nantucket, or that you can’t find a suit from among the thousands sold online and in stores. But there is a definite mental hurdle between what you know looks genuinely sexy and what the rest of the world considers hot, which is a cross between a Gucci model and a porn star. Last week, at the encouragement of my editors, I threw myself into two days of bathing-suit shopping. I always say: I was born to endure. But their interest in my potential humiliation (was that a laugh track I heard in the Saks dressing room once the saleswoman deigned to unlock the door, the glare that of a police klieg light?) interested me. Was the assignment a form of editorial sport? Was I cruelly being recognized as the Every Woman, with body issues? (O.K.: flab.) Well. I boarded the escalator at Saks. I rode and rode until I reached the plus-size fashion floor (endure!), where I took another escalator to the lingerie department. The placement of swimsuits in department stores is intriguing. Plainly, the reason merchants put them so far from the front door is that they don’t generate the kinds of sales cosmetics and handbags do. But women don’t think like merchants. They want what is new the moment it enters their minds — and I hate to point out the obvious, but in the time it takes to reach the top floor of a busy department store, you can order the garment online. Of all the stores I visited, only Bloomingdale’s had its swimsuits next to other summer fashion. The Chanel boutique in SoHo posed a different challenge. When I asked a saleswoman if they had any swimsuits — I remembered some adorable ones on the runway — she said the only ones they had were on the mannequins in the windows. Maybe she expected me to climb into the window and struggle with the mannequin myself, but she didn’t budge. I left, wondering how she would have reacted if I had arrived in a limo and broken her nail when I dropped my big Fendi buckle bag on the counter. (A Chanel spokeswoman said its swimsuits were very popular this season and had sold out early. “However, the bigger miss was the opportunity to respond with the level of customer service that we strive for,” she said.) At Saks, I grabbed any suit I thought might look good. Buying a bathing suit is a lot like buying a wedding gown: usually the one you choose is a lot different from the one you pictured in your bedroom. I picked out a coral-and-pink micro-check Missoni one piece ($330); an olive green Lisa Curran tankini ($145); a Dolce & Gabbana leopard-print one piece ($495), and black shirred Miracle Suit ($132), which promised to banish 10 pounds in 10 seconds, and I’ll tell you right now it did no such thing. The fabric of the Missoni was heavenly but offered absolutely no support or shape. Maybe if I was sitting on a volcanic island with 20 ripening Italian women in their Missonis, it would work, but what were the chances of that? The tankini, on the other hand, made me think I should have a tattoo and boyfriend named Billy Ray. I loved the Dolce suit. The leopard print was flattering and fun, and the high cut lengthened my legs. The only trouble was, I couldn’t manage to keep up the top, which consisted of two foam-lined cups rimmed in a black ruffle. Without a strap, no pair of breasts, big or small, was going to stop those cups from dropping down like an airplane seat tray. It’s strictly a posing suit.
