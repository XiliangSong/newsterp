http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/us/31road.html Louisiana Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims Sets Deadline for Storm Damage Claims Road Home, the Louisiana grant program for homeowners who lost their houses to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, is expected to cost far more than the $7.5 billion provided by the federal government, in part because many more families have applied than officials had anticipated. » As a result, Louisiana officials on Tuesday night set a July 31 deadline for applicants, who can receive up to $150,000 to repair or rebuild their houses. With the cutoff date, the state hopes to be able to figure out how much more money it needs to pay for the program; the shortfall is projected to be $2.9 billion. The financial woes of set off a frenzy of finger-pointing between federal and state officials, who blame one another for the projected shortfall. But it has stirred something close to despair among some Louisiana residents, who were already bemoaning the sluggish way the program has given out the money it does have; only 22,000 families statewide, out of 140,000 applicants, have received grants so far, for a total of $1.3 billion. The new problem has reinforced the fears of many in New Orleans that they are being abandoned by the federal government, even as it acknowledges that its levee system failed during Hurricane Katrina. “There’s no way they can ever make everybody whole, but they need to fix the thing they broke,” said Frank A. Silvestri, a New Orleans lawyer and co-founder of the Citizens’ Road Home Action Team, which has been critical of the program. Evidence that the program out of money has been building for several weeks as the state has finally begun making a significant number of grants since the inception of months ago. The grants have averaged about $76,000, which is more than the roughly $60,000 the state predicted last August. State officials say that many more houses turned out to have had severe damage than federal data indicated back when the program was created. They have also been surprised by a recent surge in applications, which are running at several hundred a day, almost two years after the storms, said Gentry Brann, director of communications for the program. The state also expected private insurance companies to cover a larger percentage of the damage, said Walter J. Leger Jr., a lawyer and member of the Louisiana Recovery Authority, which created “Anecdotally, the companies aren’t paying,” Mr. Leger said. “National Flood Insurance paid out, but private insurers didn’t.” Insurance benefits are generally subtracted from grants awarded by the program. But Mr. Leger and other state officials concede that many homeowners may have preferred to try to get larger grants from the Road Home, rather than fight with their insurers. The Bush administration contends that the state itself created the shortfall by paying for home damage caused by wind, rather than limiting the program to flood damage. Insurance policies are more likely to cover wind damage than flood damage. The decision to pay for wind damage added about 43,000 houses to the likely total covered by the program, at a cost of about $2.6 billion, according to data from the office of Donald E. Powell, President Bush’s coordinator for Gulf Coast rebuilding. Even so, Mr. Powell “is not opposed to additional funding — if the state can make a clear case for more funds,” his spokeswoman, Susan Aspey, wrote in an e-mail message. “He wants to get this resolved as quickly as possible for the people of Louisiana, and he’s indicated his willingness to sit down with the governor and her staff to work towards that end.” State officials, from the governor on down, say the program has always covered wind damage, and that they do not understand why Mr. Powell is raising the issue so late in the game. The state had a similar run-in with the Department of Housing and Urban Development over the way it paid out the grant money, and ended up changing the program in April. Louisiana is also fighting the Federal Emergency Management Agency for more than $1 billion it was counting on for FEMA says it cannot release the money — intended for hazard-mitigation efforts like elevating houses — because against younger people by exempting people 65 and older from a requirement that grant recipients live in their rebuilt houses for three years.

Thompson will begin raising money for a campaign for the Republican nomination. May 30 — Former Senator of Tennessee has taken new steps that make it clear that he for the White House, potentially shaking up a field of candidates that has failed to strike a chord with the Republican base. His Own Words The latest political news from around the nation. Ann Johansson Senator Fred Thompson greeted Boy Scouts after speaking in California to the Lincoln Club of Orange County on May 4. Mr. Thompson is creating a committee that will let him begin raising money on Monday toward a full-blown national campaign, advisers said Wednesday. They hope his name recognition as an actor and radio commentator, conservative stands on issues like and government spending, and strength in the South will differentiate him from the current crop of candidates. The disclosure of his intensifying activities sent ripples through the party, with the campaigns of two of the main Republican candidates checking with their deputies in Iowa and New Hampshire to monitor any hiring or fund-raising efforts by Mr. Thompson, 64. One campaign held a brief strategy session to review poll results on Mr. Thompson, and found him well-positioned even as an unannounced candidate. His moves come as have failed to coalesce around a candidate, as they struggle with the war in Iraq, President Bush’s unpopularity and questions about the party’s ideological direction. That has created a potential opening in a campaign field that, judging by polls and other reaction, has left Republican voters wanting more. “Thompson is a credible conservative, he has a strong voting record, he has strong, almost Reagan-esque communication skills,” said Scott Reed, who managed the presidential campaign of the Republican in 1996 and is unaffiliated with any campaigns. “And like Reagan, he believes in an ideological agenda in an undiluted way. He doesn’t have a bunch of qualifiers on things when he defends the Reagan years.” In a conference call on Tuesday, 75 to 100 Republicans who had offered to back the politician better known for his acting career were urged to raise roughly $50,000 each for the financial underpinnings of a Thompson bid that has been in the making for months. Five people closely involved in the emerging campaign discussed the plans in interviews Wednesday but asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to talk publicly about the details. Participants on the call said Mr. Thompson was enthusiastic about becoming an alternative to current contenders led by former Mayor of New York, Senator of Arizona and former Gov. of Massachusetts. They said he was not ready to formally announce without evidence that he could draw the necessary financial support. “You have to raise money to be competitive even if you are Fred Thompson,” said Representative Zach Wamp, a Tennessee Republican who has led an effort to draft Mr. Thompson. In another development on Wednesday, Mr. Thompson asked to be released from his role on “Law & Order” on NBC, The Associated Press reported. The show’s executive producer, Dick Wolf, said Mr. Thompson had told him that he “has not made a firm decision about his political future” but that he was concerned about “the creative and scheduling constraints of the upcoming season.” By joining the race late, Mr. Thompson may face questions about his ability to compete against the top-tier Republican candidates who have already raised at least $10 million each. He will also not participate in the Republican debate in New Hampshire on Tuesday. Tony Fabrizio, a Republican pollster and strategist who is not working for any candidate, said he was “surprised and a little sad” that Mr. Thompson had not declared himself a full-fledged candidate. Mr. Thompson has faced questions about his political commitment stemming from his days in the Senate. “Thompson will be competing against three guys who have been running flat out for months and working their tails off for well over a year,” Mr. Fabrizio said. “If you’re not going to get in this race and double-time on work, effort and commitment, how do you expect to win? You need to send signals that say, ‘I’m here and I’m going to win.’ “ Although Mr. Thompson planned in the coming days to create what is known as a “testing the waters” committee that would allow him to raise and spend money, members of Mr. Thompson’s inner circle said that if the next few weeks were encouraging, he could officially enter the race as early as July. “Fred Thompson is doing everything he has to do to gauge support to come to a final decision in a timely manner,” said Mark Corallo, who has been acting as his spokesman. The intense interest in Mr. Thompson’s trajectory reflected concern in the rival Republican camps about his possible appeal across the South, among conservative and evangelical voters, who might be attracted to his mainstream conservative stances, like opposition to and strong support for states’ rights. “There are still a lot of undecided voters in South Carolina, and Fred Thompson comes with enormous appeal — I’d call it -like appeal,” said Katon Dawson, the chairman of the Republican Party in South Carolina, which holds one of the first presidential primaries. Allies of Mr. Thompson said they were confident he would attract big-name contributors and present and former office holders now supporting other candidates. But potential competitors questioned his ability to make such inroads. Kate Phillips contributed reporting. Faults &#8217;86 Law on Immigrants Ex-Senator Seen as Rehearsing for Prime Time G.O.P.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/us/31lake.html Lake Okeechobee Drops to a Record Low Okeechobee Drops to a Record Low Scott Fisher/South Florida Sun-Sentinel, via Associated Press Stranded near Slim&#146;s Fish Camp on Torry Island in Belle Glade, Fla. POINT, Fla., May 30 — This state seems to seesaw perpetually between crises related to water: either too much or too little. Fisher/South Florida Sun-Sentinel, via Associated Press Fire burning to western shore of Lake Okeechobee on Tuesday. Levels are falling about a half-inch a day. Wednesday was no exception, as the retreating waters of drought-sapped Lake Okeechobee, a vital reservoir for millions of residents in dry times, sank toward a new low. Signaling the intensity of this once-a-century drought, roiling smoke clouds rose from exposed stretches of the saucerlike 730-square-mile basin midway between the crowded coasts. The plumes came from wildfires sweeping a 12,000-acre stretch of lakebed exposed as the waters retreated and sank about half an inch a day, water officials said. The flames fed on weeds and grasses that normally provide hiding places for bass, but are now baked by the sun and dehydrated by relentless winds. Officials at the South Florida Water Management District said the lake depth on Wednesday &#151; about six feet below normal &#151; matched the record low set in a long drought in 2001 and would certainly break the record overnight. “This year is definitely a larger challenge than 2001,” said Carol Wehle, executive director of the water district. “We have drought all the way from Disney to Key West.” Ms. Wehle said the easterly winds like those blowing over this town on the eastern shore of the lake were accelerating the drop in water by speeding evaporation. “Add to that warmer temperatures and lots of sunshine and when it gets this dry it doesn’t take much for the fire to spread,” she said. Thunderstorms predicted for this week, even a hurricane or two, are unlikely to end the water woes, Ms. Wehle said. “We need feet of rain, but coming every day throughout the summer,” she said. “When you have one big storm dumping a lot of water, the system can’t catch it.” Allows Florida to Clean Bottom of Lake Okeechobee Three States Delay Water-Sharing Plan National Briefing | South: Florida: Red Tide Spreads To Tampa Bay National Briefing | South: Florida: Water Plan Is Delayed Rivera Autographed Page
http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/washington/31asylum.html seekers in the United States face broad disparities in the nation’s 54 courts, with the outcome of cases influenced by things like the location of the court and the sex and professional background of judges, a of the Report The study, by three law professors, analyzes 140,000 decisions by immigration judges, including those cases from the 15 countries that have produced the most asylum seekers in recent years, among them China, Haiti, Colombia, Albania and Russia. The professors compared for the first time the results of immigration court cases over more than four years, finding vast differences in the handling of claims with generally comparable factual circumstances. In one of the starker examples cited, Colombians had an 88 percent chance of winning asylum from one judge in the Miami immigration court and a 5 percent chance from another judge in the same court. “It is very disturbing that these decisions can mean life or death, and they seem to a large extent to be the result of a clerk’s random assignment of a case to a particular judge,” said an author of the study, Philip G. Schrag, a professor at The study offers an unusually detailed window into the overburdened and often erratic immigration courts. Though the immigration bill now being considered does not propose major revisions in asylum laws, those courts serve as the judicial backbone of the immigration system that would take on an immense new workload if the bill becomes law. The legislation would offer a road to legal status to an estimated 12 million illegal immigrants, eliminate backlogs of legal immigration cases and step up enforcement, among other measures. Experts predict countless legal snags that would land before the immigration judges. Officials at the Executive Office for Immigration Review of the Department of Justice, which oversees the immigration courts, declined to allow interviews about the study with David L. Neal, the chief immigration judge, citing a policy that immigration judges do not speak with the news media about their rulings. The study found that someone who has fled China in fear of persecution and asks for asylum in immigration court in Orlando, Fla., has an excellent — 76 percent — chance of success, while the same refugee would have a 7 percent chance in Atlanta. Similarly, a Haitian seeking refuge from political violence is almost twice as likely to succeed in New York as in Miami. Immigration lawyers acknowledge that the judges have difficult work, with huge dockets of cases that must be decided speedily on the basis of scant or subjective information. Often the asylum seeker is the only witness to crucial events. But because immigration law is federal, the study’s authors argued, some uniformity could be expected in judges’ asylum rulings across the country, particularly in cases of people fleeing a country, like China or Colombia, where the conditions of political oppression or civil violence are publicly known. “It’s such a high-volume system where the participants have so little time to test cases and make decisions, you become much more subject to the general viewpoint of the judge,” said Bo Cooper, a lawyer at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker who is a former general counsel of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. That has created a risk, Mr. Cooper said, that “the system will not be good enough at providing refuge to those in need or identifying the claims of those who are not in need.” The wide discretion exercised by immigration judges can be disheartening to lawyers and disastrous for immigrants facing threats to their lives if they are forced to return home, immigration lawyers said. “Oftentimes, it’s just the luck of the draw,” said Cheryl Little, a lawyer and executive director of the Florida Immigrant Advocacy Center, a legal assistance group in Miami that represents many asylum seekers. “It’s heartbreaking,” Ms. Little said. “How do you explain to people asking for refuge that even in the United States of America we can’t assure them they will receive due process and justice?” While immigration officers at Citizenship and Immigration Services, the federal agency, can grant asylum, the majority of asylum cases are decided by the immigration judges. Under the immigration system, refugees are foreigners coming from abroad who win residency in the United States for protection from religious persecution or political threats. Asylum is granted to foreigners who apply for refuge when they are already in the United States. The study is based on data on judges’ decisions from January 2000 through August 2004. It will be posted today on the Web site of the Social Science Research Network, , and published in November in the Stanford Law Review. In addition to Professor Schrag, the authors are Andrew I.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/education/31dayton.html Ohio School Fears Cuts Will Rewrite Its Success Story School Fears Cuts Will Rewrite Its Success Story Greg Sailor Clark, left, and Arrick Greene graduated Wednesday from the Dayton Early College Academy. May 30 — The 32 students who graduated from the Dayton Early College Academy on Wednesday evening were mostly from low-income families. Few of their parents went to college. Sailor Jones teaches science at the academy. Greg Sailor Hennessey is the principal of the Dayton Early College Academy. Budget cuts may force the school to change its structure. &#147;For us to lose teachers would be catastrophic,&#148; Ms. Hennessey says. But every member of the graduating class, the school’s first, will attend college in the fall on the strength of their academic achievements and $2 million in scholarship offers, a remarkable success story in a school district plagued by budget shortfalls and challenges endemic to urban schools. That success, however, may not be enough to save the experimental public high school. Voters rejected a school tax levy on May 8, forcing the school district to cut $30 million from its budget. That could result in the academy’s reverting to a more traditional model. With more than 200 layoffs planned in the district, many of the teachers who have developed the academy’s curriculum through trial and error are likely to lose their jobs to teachers with more experience because the teachers’ union requires layoffs to be made according to seniority. Some positions would probably be eliminated. “For us to lose teachers would be catastrophic,” said Judy Hennessey, who resigned as superintendent of the affluent school district in nearby Oakwood to become principal of the academy, which has 225 students who are required to begin taking college-level courses by their junior or senior year. The school, which is in an office building owned by the University of Dayton, was founded and operated in part with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the KnowledgeWorks Foundation, based in Cincinnati. Some supporters want to convert the academy into a charter school, which would free it from dealing with the teachers’ union and help it retain its staff. The student-teacher ratio at the academy is 14 to 1, compared with the district average of 33 to 1, Ms. Hennessey said. who is speaker of the Ohio House and whose district includes the academy, said he was willing to sponsor a bill allowing it to become a charter school if the teachers’ union does not exempt the academy from layoffs by seniority. “I want them to keep this as part of the public system,” Mr. Husted said, “but if they’re unwilling to do that, I think preserving the school is more important.” Patricia Lynch, the president of the teachers’ union, was on the planning committee that formed the school but said it could not be exempt from cuts. “There are going to be setbacks in every school,” Ms. Lynch said. Thomas J. Lasley II, the dean of the School of Education at the University of Dayton and a founder of the academy, said the school and others like it were desperately needed. “If you’re going to educate urban kids, you’re going to need niche places,” Dr. Lasley said. “We can’t be losing this much intellectual capital and expect cities like Dayton to survive too long.” Away from the financing tug of war, the graduating students were ebullient. Jerusha Clark, 18, graduated with a diploma and an associate’s degree in liberal arts. She has enrolled at Mars Hill College near Asheville, N.C., majoring in pre-med biology. Kasandra Maxwell, 18, will study engineering at the University of Dayton. Other students, like Shaina Moore, a 16-year-old sophomore, hope the school continues untouched next year. Ms. Moore’s mother died in 1999, and her grandmother, who became her guardian, suffered from alcohol abuse, she said. Ms. Moore went into foster care and missed 100 school days in fifth grade in a downward spiral she worried might never end. With the help of her great-aunt and great-uncle, who became her guardians in 2001, she found her footing and has since blossomed at the academy. “I started out struggling my first year,” she said. “Now that I’m acquainted, I feel like it’s my second home.” Ms. Moore loves the language arts, she said, especially persuasive writing. She hopes to use her powers of persuasion as a probation officer to help people set their lives straight.
