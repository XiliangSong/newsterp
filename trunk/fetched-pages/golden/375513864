http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6704313.stm | Europe | EU asks industry to fight obesity 30 May 2007, 11:33 GMT 12:33 asks industry to fight obesity More than half of Europe's population is overweight Europe's food and drink industry could face new regulations if it does not try harder to tackle obesity, the European Commission has warned. Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said Europe needed healthier food and stronger advertising codes. He urged industry to act voluntarily, but said a review in 2010 would decide whether new laws were needed. The commission will make proposals later this year on labelling food, to help consumers make healthy choices. "The figures are frightening. More than 50% of the adult population is overweight or obese, and more than 21 million children are overweight or obese," Mr Kyprianou said. Body Mass Index figures (healthy = 18.5 to 25) "Even more worrying, the rate of increase [among children] is more than 400,000 per year. Today's overweight children will be tomorrow's adults with all these chronic illnesses." He said some progress had been made in reducing the level of fats and salt in food, but not enough. The commission is also proposing programmes to promote consumption of fruit and vegetables, and a White Paper on sport. Mr Kyprianou said children no longer entertained themselves through physical activity, so member states should ensure schools re-introduced "physical activity as entertainment, fun and games" for every child. A high level group, including a representative from every member state, will be created to encourage the exchange of best practice. European consumers' group BEUC had urged the commission to introduce binding regulation on advertising and nutritional labelling. "It seems that the commission has taken the easy way out by adopting a voluntary approach, combined with a policy of wait-and-see," said BEUC director, Jim Murray. The commission says poor diets and low levels of physical activity account for six of the seven leading risk factors for ill health in Europe. The World Health Organization says the prevalence of obesity has more than trebled in many European countries since the 1980s. organ donor card proposed EU asks industry to fight obesity Sarkozy 'won't stop Turkey talks' EU sets new digital media rules A think tank argues against channelling aid through the EU Sarkozy excites and worries EU EU fails to excite Bulgarians Mark Mardell on the US plan to bring its missile shield to Europe THE UK AND EUROPE UK beach hygiene hailed in report Migrants 'want to settle in UK' A timeline of the EU Q&A: EU constitution's future Health and Consumer Protection Directorate General blames US in missile row Turkish MPs force reform showdown
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6705667.stm 31 May 2007, 14:00 GMT 15:00 who want to quit can struggle to break the addiction A prescription-only pill to help people quit smoking has received draft approval for use on the NHS. Varenicline (Champix) is the first non-nicotine drug developed specifically to help smokers give up, and was licensed in the UK in 2006. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence said the drug should normally be given alongside counselling and support. Final guidance is due in July - the start of the smoking ban in England. Varenicline, produced by Pfizer, is unusual as it both stimulates and blocks specific nicotinic receptors in the brain. Graphic: How Varenicline works It is thought that by stimulating the receptor it mimics the effects of nicotine to reduce cravings. At the same time, it partially blocks the receptor preventing nicotine from binding to it, resulting in a weaker response in people who give in to temptation and have a cigarette. Some people have tried nicotine replacement therapy and been unsuccessful Trials have shown the drug was effective after a 12-week course, with 44% of smokers managing to stop. This compares with 18% of those given a placebo and 30% of those taking another anti-smoking drug, bupropion, which is also available on the NHS. The main side-effect of the drug, which costs about £1.95 a day or £163.80 for a 12-week course, seems to be nausea. The charity Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) had issued interim guidelines following discussions with the Department of Health to help health professionals prescribe the new treatment, while awaiting a decision from NICE, whose draft recommendations are still subject to appeal. A spokeswoman for NICE said: "Having looked at all the evidence, our independent committee have concluded that varenicline appears to be a good way to help people who want to quit smoking. "The draft guidance also recommends that varenicline should normally be provided in conjunction with counselling and support, but if such support is not available, this should not stop smokers receiving treatment with varenicline." Due to the burden placed upon the NHS by smokers it makes economic sense to fund this treatment Send us your comments From 1 July, there will be a ban on smoking in virtually all enclosed work and public places in England. Experts have predicted a surge of smokers attending NHS stop-smoking services in the run-up to the ban. Nicotine replacement therapy and buproprion - an antidepressant that has been found to help smokers quit - are already widely available on the NHS. Amanda Sanford, spokesperson for ASH, said the NICE guidance would push PCTs to offer varenicline as an alternative. "It's important smokers are offered a choice as some people have tried nicotine replacement therapy and been unsuccessful. "There's no reason varenicline can't be offered as a first-line treatment as it has been shown to be cost-effective," she said. Dr Alex Bobak, a GP in Wandsworth, south London, and a smoking cessation expert, said more people were asking about stopping smoking in the run-up to the ban. "It's tremendous we can offer this option for smokers who want to quit. "I've been using [varenicline] an awful lot and people have been asking about it." Nicotine from a cigarette stimulates the release of dopamine - a substance produced by the body which triggers feelings of pleasure When a smoker quits, the lack of nicotine leads to reduced levels of dopamine, causing feelings of craving and withdrawal Varenicline both blocks the nicotine receptors (reducing the addictive power of the drug) and triggers moderate dopamine release to alleviate withdrawal symptoms Return to the top BBC News 24 will be discussing the smoking ban in the England, which comes into force on July 1, and would like to put your questions on the subject to experts, who will answer them live on air on Friday.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/americas/6706437.stm | Americas | US steps up precautions over TB 30 May 2007, 21:21 GMT 22:21 steps up precautions over TB Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection spread through the air US officials have begun a worldwide search for people who may have come into contact with a man infected with a drug-resistant form of tuberculosis. They say crew and passengers on the same flights as the man, from Atlanta to Paris and from Prague to Montreal this month, should be checked. The man was honeymooning in Italy when he was told he had the rare form of TB - but still decided to return home. He is now under federal quarantine, the first issued in over 44 years. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has identified the illness as "extensively drug-resistant TB". This bacteria is a very deadly bacteria - we just have to err on the side of caution Dr Julie Gerberding, CDC CDC director Julie Gerberding said it was looking through passenger lists to try to find people who may have come into contact with the man, whose name has not been made public. "Is the patient himself highly infectious? Fortunately, in this case, he's probably not...," Dr Gerberding said, adding that the bacteria was "very deadly". "We just have to err on the side of caution." The man told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he knew he had a form of tuberculosis but not that it was so serious. He told the paper doctors had not told him to avoid flying, the Associated Press said. When he was on honeymoon he was told by health officials that he should surrender himself to Italian authorities. "I thought to myself: You're nuts. I wasn't going to do that. They told me I had been put on the no-fly list and my passport was flagged," the man said. The last federal quarantine order was issued in 1963, to isolate a patient with smallpox, according to the CDC. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that usually attacks the lungs. It is spread through the air and can lead to symptoms such as chest pain and coughing up blood. There were an estimated 1.6 million deaths from TB in 2005, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). The infected man travelled from Atlanta to Paris on 12 May on Air France flight 385. He returned to the North America on CSA flight 104 from Prague to Montreal on 24 May and continued his journey by car. CDC officials said the man was potentially infectious during this period and are recommending that crew members and passengers on board the same flights seek medical attention. "We want to make sure that we have done everything we possibly can to identify people who could be at risk," said Dr Gerberding. TB is rare in the US. Last year there were 13,767 recorded cases or 4.6 cases per 100,000 Americans. About 1.2% of cases in the US are "multidrug-resistant", and can withstand antibiotics commonly used to treat the illness, according to CDC statistics. The "extensively drug-resistant" TB is more dangerous. Medical treatment can cost $500,000 (£250,000) or more, CDC officials say. in TB flight infection warning 29 urges new greenhouse gas goals US growth weakest in four years Russia blames US in missile row
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/6707463.stm 31 May 2007, 11:53 GMT 12:53 difficile rates have been on the rise Thousands of cases of the hospital bug Clostridium difficile have not been reported in recent years, data shows. Hospitals have been required to submit C. difficile rates since 2004 - but only for over 65s until April this year when all patients have been included. Data from 171 NHS trusts in England - over 90% of the total - showed there has been an extra 26,000 cases on top of the 176,450 infections reported. Tory MP Grant Shapps, who compiled the figures, said they were "shocking". C. difficile is a bacterium found in the gut of up to 3% of healthy adults and 66% of infants, although it rarely causes problems Certain antibiotics can disturb the normal balance, allowing the bug to thrive and causing severe diarrhoea and in some cases severe inflammation of the bowel which can be life threatening Quick guide: Hospital bugs He asked all hospital trusts in England for their C. difficile statistics - most have the data for all patients but only publish the over 65s under the government's surveillance scheme. He said: "This investigation reveals that the number of C. difficile cases has been dramatically underestimated with the government simply ignoring anyone who contracts the infection, but happens to be under the age of 65." And he added; "It is an absolute scandal that I had to go to these lengths to get the true figures revealed." C difficile is linked to twice as many deaths as MRSA, and, unlike the so-called superbug, C difficile infection rates are still on the rise. 'No room for complacency' The number of cases in 2006 rose by 8% on the previous year to 55,000 infections. A spokesman for the Department of Health said: "There is no room for complacency. "We are clear - one avoidable infection is one too many and we are determined to ensure that the NHS has in place good hygiene and clinical procedures "We have recognised that C. difficile is a growing problem - which is why, along with our action programme to tackle all infections, we have a number of specific interventions. "We have improved the surveillance system to provide better local data, and local trusts have agreed local targets to significantly reduce C. difficile infections." and information to help you get more from the NHS 26 Apr over deadly hospital bugs 30 Jan superbug claims may surge 30 Nov on the hospital superbug 09 Feb squads' to help tackle MRSA 06 Feb deaths up by nearly quarter 23 Feb
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/4121411.stm timeline 23 December, 2004, 13:42 GMT occurs and a ball of quickly multiplying cells embeds itself in the lining of the uterus. In the UK pregnancy is calculated from the first day of the woman's last period so for as much as three weeks of this first month she might not be actually pregnant. When fertilisation does occur the tiny mass of cells called a blastocyst at this stage embeds itself in the lining of the womb which is already thickening to support it. The mass of cells is developing fast and becomes an embryo. For many women the first sign of pregnancy is a missed period. Shopbought tests are considered largely reliable so the mother-to-be does not have to have her pregnancy confirmed by her GP. If a first test is negative a second one a few days later may prove positive as hormone levels in the urine rise. The embryo officially becomes a foetus. It is about the size of a baked bean and its spine and nervous system begin to form. The foetus already has its own blood system and may be a different blood group from its mother. Blood vessels are forming in what will become the umbilical cord and tiny buds which will become limbs appear. The baby&acute;s heart is beginning to develop. Morning sickness and other side effects of early pregnancy may take hold. Around this time many women find they experience the side-effects of early pregnancy including needing to urinate more often nausea and vomiting and feeling a bit weepy and irritable. All medication including supplements need to be carefully checked as the foetus is undergoing vital development in the first 12 weeks. If the woman has not told her GP or community midwife she is pregnant yet now is a good time to do so. It is quite common to have a first scan at this stage if the woman has had a previous miscarriage or bleeding. An early scan is often done through the vagina and is used to check the pregnancy is not ectopic. It should show up the baby&acute;s heartbeat. The nervous system is also developing rapidly especially the brain. The head gets bigger and eyes form under the skin of the face. The foetus' limbs are growing and look more like arms and legs. All internal organs are developing and becoming more complex. The foetus is about 5cm long with its head tucked onto its chest. It has most its major organs and eyes and ears are developing. A scan at 10-13 weeks is recommended to pin down the date of the pregnancy. The umbilical cord is fully formed providing nourishment and removing waste products. The foetus looks fully human now. By this week the threat of miscarriage is much reduced. Many women announce their pregnancy to friends and colleagues. The foetus is growing in length much more quickly by now it is about eight cm long and weighs about 60 grams. The placenta is now wellformed though it's not yet doing its full job it takes over fully in week 14. The mother is likely to have her first scan this week. The womans uterus is becoming larger and is starting to rise out of the pelvis. The foetus can move its head quite easily. Third of the way through. The average pregnancy lasts 266 days or 280 days from the first day of last period. Screening for Downs syndrome is offered about now. A simple blood test is carried out first then further tests may be offered. On the basis of the blood test results the woman may opt for a Chorionic Villus sample or an amniocentesis which would diagnose or other chromosomal abnormalities. However these diagnostic tests have a small risk of subsequent miscarriage. An alternative to blood tests is a nuchal translucency scan a new scan offered by some larger hospitals. But again an amniocentisis would be required for firm diagnosis. The foetus now has toe and finger nails eyebrows and eyelashes. It is also covered with downy hair. The hair that will cover the baby until the last week or so of pregnancy - called lanugo - starts to form. This hair is very fine more like down and it probably serves as some form of insulation and protection for the skin. The foetus can hear noises from the outside world. By this stage the mother is visibly pregnant and the uterus is rising. By this stage the foetus is moving around a lot - probably enough to be felt. The foetus is now about 15-20cm long and weighs about 300g. Milk teeth have formed in the gums. Half way through pregnancy now. Almost all mothers are offered a routine scan. The foetus develops a waxy coating called vernix. The scan can show the foetus in fine detail and often reveal if the baby is a boy or a girl. However not all hospitals offer to tell parents the sex of the child - and not all parents want to know. The mother may feel short of breath as her uterus pushes against her diaphragm leaving less space for the lungs. The mother may be offered another ultrasound scan around this time. The scan can check the baby&acute;s spine internal organs and growth are normal. Senses develop: taste buds have started to form on the tongue and the foetus starts to feel touch. The skeleton continues to develop and bones that form the skull begin to harden - but not fully. Antenatal checkup and scan to check the baby&acute;s position. A baby born this early does sometimes survive. A baby born at 24 weeks may possibly survive but it would have severe breathing difficulties as its lungs would not be strong enough to cope. It would also be very thin lightweight and susceptible to infections. All organs are now in place and the rest of the pregnancy is for growth. Preeclampsia is a risk from here onwards. This potentially fatal condition causes high blood pressure protein in the urine and swelling caused by fluid retention. The causes are unclear but research suggests it may be linked to an immune reaction to the foetus or the placenta. If the condition is serious women may be advised to take drugs to lower their blood pressure and in some cases an early caesarean or induction may be performed. Serious complications of pregnancy The foetus skin is gradually becoming more opaque than transparent. The foetus measures about 34cm and weighs about 800g. Routine checkup to test for preeclampsia. Women with Rhesus negative blood will also be tested for antibodies. If the mother has Rh negative blood but the baby is Rh positive she can develop antibodies to her baby&acute;s blood during labour. This is not a problem in the first birth but can affect subsequent pregnancies and result in stillbirth. Fortunately treatment is simple and effective. BBC Health: Ask the doctor - Rhesus disease Some women develop restless leg syndrome in their third trimester. This is sensations such as crawling tingling or even cramps and burning inside the foot or leg - often in the evening and at night disturbing sleep and making the mother feel she needs to get up and walk around. No-one knows what causes this harmless but irritating condition. Braxton Hicks contractions may begin around now. They are practice contractions which dont usually hurt. These are irregular, painless contractions which feel like a squeezing sensation near the top of the uterus. If contractions become painful or occur four times an hour or more, the woman should call a doctor as she may be in early labour. The foetus can see now and tell light from dark. The mother&acute;s breasts start to produce colostrum about now This high calorie milk is produced by the mother to feed the baby for the first few days after birth before normal milk starts. Another antenatal appointment. The foetus is about 42cm and weighs 2.2kg. A baby born now has a good chance of survival. From now the baby should become settled in a head downwards position. A midwife can help to move it if necessary. The mother may find it more difficult to eat full meals as the expanded uterus presses on her stomach. If the mother has been told she may need a planned caesarean, now is a good time to discuss it further. The baby&acute;s head may engage in the pelvis any time now. The baby&acute;s lungs are practically mature now and it can survive unaided. The final weeks in the womb are to put on weight. Babies born from this week onward are not considered early. Another ante-natal appointment. The mother has reached her full size and weight by now. In theory the baby should be born this week. The mother&acute;s cervix prepares for the birth by softening. First babies are often up to a week late but if there are signs of distress to mother or child the birth will be induced. week by week guide to what happens to mother and baby during pregnancy Nine months: An overview at a Glance
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/health/2000/heart_disease/default.stm BBC News Disease The UK has one of the highest rates of death from heart disease in the world - one British adult dies from the disease every three minutes - and stroke is the country's third biggest killer, claiming 70,000 lives each year. Heart attacks occur when blood flow is blocked, often by a blood clot, while strokes are caused either by blocked or burst blood vessels in the brain. A range of other conditions, including heart failure, when blood is not pumped properly around the body, and congenital heart defects can also cause long term problems, and even death, for sufferers. - The blood returns from the lungs to the upper left chamber of the heart where it is again briefly stored until the atrium fills, before flowing on to the left ventricle. - Impure or blue blood returning from the atrium enters the heart here, where it is held until the atrium - or chamber - fills up. - This is the most powerful chamber of the heart. It pumps the newly oxygenated blood to the rest of the body through the aorta, or main artery. - This powerful pump propels blood into the pulmonary artery, the tube which carries blood to the lungs, where carbon dioxide in the blood is removed and oxygen added.
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6703467.stm out' HIV testing launched 30 May 2007, 11:46 GMT 12:46 out' HIV testing launched HIV tests should be offered routinely Countries with HIV epidemics should carry out HIV tests on everyone attending health centres unless they 'opt out', say experts Issuing new guidance, the World Health Organisation said 200 million people could benefit from the policy. Currently 80% of people infected with HIV in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa do not know they have it. However, no test should be done against a person's wishes or without their knowledge, the guidelines stress. Forcing them to carry out HIV tests insults their intelligence in such a way that they are no different from animals Omara Daniel Allan, Kampala Send us your comments Dr Kevin De Cock, director of WHO HIV/Aids said too many opportunities to diagnose the infection were being missed. Industrialised countries also need to take note of the guidance which recommends offering a test to everyone who presents with symptoms suggestive of HIV and people in high-risk groups, such as those attending sexual health clinics. Recent surveys in sub-Saharan Africa showed on average just 12% of men and 10% of women have been tested for HIV and received their test results. Until now, testing was only done if a person requested it. But in countries with HIV epidemic that affects the whole population, all patients attending all health facilities should now be offered testing, whether or not the patient has symptoms of HIV disease and regardless of the patient's reason for attending the health centre. The HIV test would be carried out unless the patient declines. Tests in low income countries cost up to $2 US dollars. People must be fully informed before testing and receive counselling afterwards, the guidance states. And patients should receive support to avoid potential negative consequences of knowing and disclosing their HIV status, such as discrimination or violence. Access to antiretroviral therapy is not a pre-requisite to testing but countries must have a treatment plan in place, which includes an intention to introduce the drugs when possible. "Globally the number of people living with HIV who are aware of their infection status is quite low - 20% in low and middle income countries" said Dr De Cock. "Even in the industrialised world the situation is far from satisfactory." "This is a significant shift but it builds on current recommendations and this document was based on lengthy consultation." Dr Paul De Lay, director of monitoring and evaluation at UNAids said it had been estimated that 200 million people worldwide could be offered tests which meant they had access to prevention advice and treatment if the were infected. "If we are going to get ahead of this epidemic, rapidly scaled up HIV treatment and prevention efforts are critical - and increased uptake of HIV testing will be fundamental to making this a reality," he said. "At the same time, and in all cases of HIV testing and counselling, the three Cs - that is consent, confidentiality and counselling - must be respected." Routinely offered HIV testing and counselling has already been implemented in a range of clinical settings in several countries, including Botswana, Kenya, Malawi, Uganda and Zambia. Some countries, such as Canada, Thailand, UK and the US offer tests in high-risk settings. Lisa Power, of the UK HIV charity Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "We fully support these recommendations. "In the UK, this means that sexual health clinics and health services for those at particular risk of HIV should be recommending HIV testing - something which we've been advocating for some time. "A third of people with HIV don't know they have it and many of them may never have considered testing. We need this proactive approach to help these people as early as possible." Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, said: "Healthcare workers, particularly in primary care, also need training so that they can identify symptoms of HIV as early as possible."

The Salk Institute study could lead to further tests to see if epicatechin also works on humans. The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, suggests it improves blood flow in the brain - especially in combination with extra exercise. However, nutritionists warn chocolate is high in fat and sugar, which may undo any potential benefits. We'd obviously recommend a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, with perhaps a small amount of chocolate - but eating five bars a day is likely to just make you fatter, without any noticeable improvement in memory Spokesman, British Nutrition Foundation This is not the first study to find a link between 'flavanol' chemicals in certain foods and health benefits - other studies claim that cardiovascular health can be improved by including them in the diet. The researchers, led by Dr Henriette van Praag, working with chocolate firm Mars, compared mice fed a typical diet with those fed a diet supplemented with epicatechin. Half the mice in each group were allowed to run on a wheel for two hours each day and then, a month later, were trained to find a platform hidden in a pool of water. Those that both exercised and ate the epicatechin diet remembered the location of the platform longer than the other mice. The epicatechin-fed mice who did not exercise also showed enhanced memory, but to a lesser degree. The mice on the special diet appeared to have greater blood vessel growth in certain parts of their brain, alongside more mature brain nerve cells. Chocolate is another source Dr van Praag said: "A logical next step will be to study the effects of epicatechin on memory and brain blood flow in aged animals - and then humans, combined with mild exercise." Dr Mark Mattson, from the US National Institute on Ageing, said: "This is an important advance because it identifies a single natural chemical with memory-enhancing effects, suggesting it may be possible to optimise brain function by combining exercise and dietary supplementation." However, a spokesman for the British Nutrition Foundation said that while there was some evidence that diets rich in flavanols could be beneficial in humans, often when flavanols such as epicatechin were given on their own, no benefits could be spotted. She added: "We'd obviously recommend a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, with perhaps a small amount of chocolate - but eating five bars a day is likely to just make you fatter, without any noticeable improvement in memory." nutrient for 'lethal ills' 11 Mar 'better than kissing' 16 Apr trial on heart patients 10 Apr
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6707175.stm says IVF couples exploited 31 May 2007, 10:53 GMT 11:53 says IVF couples exploited Lord Winston says IVF couples are being charged over the odds The IVF industry is exploiting UK couples, charging them over the odds for treatment, fertility expert Lord Robert Winston said on Wednesday. Speaking at the Hay Literary Festival in Wales, the Imperial College London professor also criticised the fertility watchdog the HFEA on its duty of care. The HFEA maintained it policed clinics and provided information to patients. One private IVF clinic said it was impossible to generalise about the private sector. It is very easy to exploit people by the fact that they're desperate and you've got the technology which they want Lord Winston said couples were being overcharged for fertility treatments, and some were being offered embryo screening tests for which there was no clinical justification. He criticised doctors in the UK for overpriced treatments, and said it was "rather depressing" to consider that some IVF treatments in London cost 10 times the fees charged in Melbourne, Australia. There are 85 licensed fertility clinics in the UK, and treatments at private clinics cost between £4,000 and £8,000 per cycle. According to the latest figures, more than 30,000 patients underwent IVF in 2004, and the HFEA estimates around 80% of treatments are performed privately. Lord Winston said: "One of the major problems facing us in healthcare is that IVF has become a massive commercial industry. "It's very easy to exploit people by the fact that they're desperate and you've got the technology which they want, which may not work." He said clinicians and scientists doing the work did not want to explore the implications of treatments and were not engaging with the public. But Dr Rajat Goswamy, medical director of the Harley Street Fertility Centre, said it was impossible to generalise about the private sector, and that many clinics were not offering some of the more controversial treatments available. He said the costs of IVF treatments in London had to be high to cover staffing and rental costs. Lord Winston also criticised the HFEA, saying it had done a "consistently bad job" at providing information to couples and limiting the availability of unscientific treatments. The HFEA said it did hold clinics accountable to ensure the safety and appropriateness of IVF treatments. A spokeswoman said: "We consider patient information to be extremely important, and so produce a wide range of information for patients." She said the HFEA also scrutinised the quality of information given to patients by clinics, but that it did not have a role in regulating treatments other than IVF procedures offered by clinics. denies 'IVF cut' claims 01 Apr 07 | UK NHS fertility care is 'a lottery' 02 Mar table of IVF clinics 10 Jan Guide - Fertility
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/south_asia/6704541.stm | South Asia | India alarm over HIV in new areas 30 May 2007, 16:40 GMT 17:40 alarm over HIV in new areas India has more HIV infections than any other country, the UN says India health officials are alarmed by the growing numbers of pregnant women infected with HIV/Aids in the key states of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar. The northern states are among India's most backward, with huge populations but poor literacy and health services. Officials say workers who migrate to cities in search of work bring the infection back to the states with them. They say unless the state governments get serious about tackling the disease, there could be an Aids epidemic. According to UN estimates, India has the highest number of HIV infections with 5.7 million people carrying the virus. The head of India's government-run National Aids Control Organisation (Naco), Sujatha Rao, told the BBC that urgent measures were needed in UP and Bihar to "stem the epidemic". There is a shift from urban to rural and from high risk to low risk categories Uttar Pradesh Aids Control Authority She was speaking after a countrywide survey to collect India's latest HIV/Aids figures. Full results of the annual Aids survey will be made public in early June. Ms Rao said the districts of Etawah, Banda and Lalitpur in UP had been found to have more than 1% of pregnant mothers infected with the virus. A high number of pregnant woman infected with HIV had also been identified in the districts of Lakhiserai and Saharsa of Bihar. Ms Rao says she is concerned over the slow response of the two state governments in dealing with the problem. The two state governments have "not realised" the seriousness of the problem but "we remain hopeful", she says. Ms Rao says the situation in UP and Bihar compares with that in the southern state of Tamil Nadu 10 years ago. Tamil Nadu is another high prevalence state as far as HIV infections are concerned, but what makes matters far more serious in the two northern states is their poor healthcare system. To compound matters, Ms Rao says, most cases of HIV/Aids infection in UP and Bihar go unreported because of the social stigma attached to the disease. The Naco chief's concern is shared by representatives of Aids control programmes in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, which together have a population of more than 280 million people. Officials say the virus is spreading to low-risk groups Health officials say the main cause of the growing incidence of HIV/Aids is migrant labour. RP Mathur of the Uttar Pradesh Aids Control Authority says around 60% of HIV cases reported come from the socially and economically backward eastern part of the state. "There is a shift from the urban to rural and from high-risk to low-risk categories" in the last few years, he says. Mr Mathur says it is estimated that UP has more than half a million HIV positive cases, but only 20,000 of them have been reported, due to the stigma attached to the disease. Bihar Aids Control Authority representative Vishal Singh says most of the infections have been detected in people who had migrated to work in places outside the state. "They get infected in industrial cities like Surat [in Gujarat] and return home to Bihar and have unprotected sex with their wives. This has to be controlled," he says. Mr Singh says given the poor economic situation in Bihar, it is important that more developed states like Gujarat take steps to educate migrants labourers working there. Rashmi Sharma of the Population Foundation of India, a non-government organisation involved in spreading awareness about HIV/Aids, says migrant labourers cannot solely be blamed. "A local community will have to take the blame for its inability to control the problem," she says. "The problem lies within the community and they have to be involved in looking for a solution." UP and Bihar are two of India's states which rank lowest on the human development index - they have high levels of illiteracy, unemployment and poor social infrastructure. Officials say it is only the wide gap between the estimated and reported cases which has kept the two states off the list of high prevalence states Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka in the south, Maharashtra in the west and Manipur and Nagaland in the north-east are considered high HIV prevalence states in India. There has been much debate about whether India does indeed have more people living with HIV than any other country. A study by British journal BMC Medicine last December suggested that methods used to estimate the number of infections in India were flawed and that the true figure could be about 40% of the estimated numbers.

Complete Moisture Plus was pulled from sale in the US six days ago following a warning from the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. US government officials linked the solution to acanthamoeba keratitis (AK), a painful eye infection. Advanced Medical Optics (AMO) which makes the solution, has issued the recall as a "precautionary measure". AMO said in a statement: "The recall is being initiated because of concerns over eye infections from acanthamoeba, a naturally occurring water-borne organism which can contribute to serious corneal infections." The recall is not related to contamination and no other AMO products are affected, the firm added. The company is asking contact lens wearers who begin suffering eye pain, redness, blurred vision or sensitivity to light to seek medical attention. There are reports of 138 cases of eye infections in the US which are being investigated. But AMO said it had not received any reports of UK users suffering eye problems. Those who swim or shower while wearing contact lenses, use tap water to clean their lenses or come into contact with contaminated water are most are most prone to getting AK, the company said. The eye infection can lead to permanent vision loss or blindness in rare cases. eye contact lens maker 25 Coping with a company disaster 15 How effective are product recalls? 20 Feb 07 | Magazine US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in anti-terror targets

The disease tends to affect older people - but can strike at any time. Excluding certain skin cancers, there were more than 270,000 new cases of the disease in 2001 - and the rate is increasing by about 1% a year. Some cancer, such as breast, are becoming more common, while new cases of lung cancer fall away due to the drop in the number of smokers. However, while the overall number of new cancers is not falling, the good news is that successful treatment rates for many of the most common types are improving rapidly.

The 50-year-old was trying to retrieve his pet from under the floorboards of his home near Evesham, Worcestershire, when the rodent attacked. It had escaped after his seven-year-old daughter had accidentally let it out of its cage on Monday night. Paramedics said the man survived largely through giving himself anti-allergy drugs before they arrived. He had suffered severe breathing difficulties and was in a semi-conscious state when the ambulance arrived at his home. They gave him further medication and took him to Alexandra Hospital, in Redditch. An ambulance service spokesman said: "If you have been identified as someone who can have severe reactions it is vital that you and your family know what to do.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6702295.stm | Tories 'to carry on Blair reform' 30 May 2007, 20:14 GMT 21:14 'to carry on Blair reform' Mr Osborne says Labour is abandoning the centre ground The Conservatives are best placed to carry on Tony Blair's public service reforms, the shadow chancellor says. George Osborne claimed Gordon Brown, the next prime minister, had "abandoned the centre ground of public service reform to the Conservative Party". The Tories would therefore have "a great opportunity to improve life for the many, not the few", he added. But at a hustings event later Mr Brown said there would be "no retreat" from the centre ground of British politics. Mr Blair has called for personalised services which allow people to choose schools and hospitals. Mr Osborne told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Blair's ideas on choice were right, but said he had been wrong to impose them from Whitehall. He said: "I'm saying work with the public service professionals, work with teachers, work with doctors to give them much greater power over their local services and to give the users of these services... the choice that is the driver of improvement in every other walk of life and can be the driver of improvement in public services. The roadblocks to reform are being put into place In full: Osborne speech "The fact that Gordon Brown has abandoned the centre ground of public service reform to the Conservative Party is a great opportunity for us to improve life... for the many not the few." In a speech later to the Policy Exchange think tank, Mr Osborne said that while the Tories and Mr Blair agreed on "the essentials of the way forward", Mr Brown, due to take over by the end of June, was not part of the "growing consensus". He said the deputy leadership debates had shown that Labour was poised to move to the left, abandoning the centre ground. "The roadblocks to reform are being put into place," he said. But Labour chairwoman Hazel Blears, who is one of six candidates for the deputy leadership, said on Wednesday night she "completely and utterly rejected" Mr Osborne's accusation that the party was "lurching to the left". We are going to stand on our principles and our beliefs and stand firmly in the centre ground of British politics "It is the Labour party that is in touch with the ambitions of people in this country," she said. And Mr Brown told people at the hustings event in Leicester there would be "no retreat" to "soft options" or the failed policies of the past. "That is what the Conservative Party did and it lost them three elections," he said. "We are going to stand on our principles and our beliefs and stand firmly in the centre ground of British politics." The solution which would provide immediate, quality health care at no large cost to the patient at the point of treatment is compulsory insurance The Tories say public services should become less "top-down", with more decisions made locally. Mr Osborne said they would not limit the number of academies that could be created, they would devolve healthcare budgets to GPs and patients and would offer disabled people a personalised budget to control how the money was spent. His speech came as the party sought to end the row over grammar schools. And while Mr Osborne rejected "alternative funding mechanisms like social insurance", Conservative MP Peter Bone wrote an article on his website calling for a system of private health insurance to be brought in. Mr Bone said that radical reform of the NHS was needed, and "the solution which would provide immediate, quality health care at no large cost to the patient at the point of treatment is compulsory insurance". full: George Osborne speech 30 Who is the real heir to Blair? 30 Brown pledges academy support 15 How Blair shaped public services 10 Blair tackles NHS critics head-on 30 Apr for 'personalised' services 19 Mar 07 | Politics Tories can save NHS, says Cameron 18 Mar 07 | Politics Reform getting faster, says Blair 24 Jan 07 | Politics issues Africa action call Coulson to be Tories' press chief Increase in anti-terror targets
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6705209.stm 30 May 2007, 23:31 GMT 00:31 woman take multivitamins in pregnancy Healthy pregnant women should think twice before taking iron supplements, say researchers who have linked high doses to blood pressure problems. Iron is often given to combat anaemia in pregnancy, but many women take extra iron, on its own or in a multivitamin. The Iranian university study, published in the British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, gave some women a 30mg daily dose as part of its research. UK experts say that this amount should only be taken on GP advice. The UK Food Standards Agency says that lower doses in UK multivitamins are unlikely to harm women. Anaemia is often associated with low birth weight and preterm births, but this does not mean that women should be popping iron pills, or any vitamin pills indiscriminately Professor Philip Steer, editor, British Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Anaemia is a common condition in pregnant women, which, if left unchecked, can contribute to premature births and low birthweight babies. It is caused by a lack of red blood cells, and taking iron on prescription helps the body produce more. The researchers from Tarbiat Modarres University wanted to check the effect of iron supplements on women whose red blood cell level was normal. They gave 370 women a 150mg dose of ferrous sulphate, which equates to approximately 30mg of actual iron, every day throughout their pregnancy. A similar number of women were given a "placebo" dummy pill containing no iron. The number of women with diagnosed high blood pressure - a disorder which can also cause problems for mother and baby - was higher in the women given the iron pills than in the other group. Many countries still offer iron pills as a routine measure for all pregnant women, and lead researcher Professor Saedeh Ziaei said: "Our trial suggests that administering it even in non-anaemic women." Professor Philip Steer, the editor of the BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, said: "Anaemia is often associated with low birth weight and preterm births, but this does not mean that women should be popping iron pills, or any vitamin pills indiscriminately, to prevent poor pregnancy outcomes." We consider that the supplements available in this country are safe, and it is up to the individual woman to choose A spokesman for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said that women should avoid taking extra iron unless recommended by their doctor or midwife. Routine iron supplementation is not practised in the UK, but blood is tested for signs of anaemia more than once during pregnancy as a matter of course. However, many healthy pregnant women take once-a-day multivitamin pills that contain smaller doses of iron - normally around 100% of the recommended dose of 15mg. Official bodies such as the Food Standards Agency recommend that pregnant women take extra vitamins such as folic acid and vitamin D, but don't encourage any other vitamin supplementation, saying that a balanced healthy diet provides all the vitamins needed. However, they said that taking 17mg or less a day - the amount UK multivitamin brands contain - was 'unlikely to be harmful'. A spokesman for the baby charity Tommy's also stressed the importance of a healthy diet, but added that women were free to take supplements if they chose.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/scotland/6706743.stm | Cardinal sounds abortion warning 31 May 2007, 15:42 GMT 16:42 sounds abortion warning The cardinal has been accused of using inflammatory words Catholic politicians who defend abortion should not expect to remain full church members, Scotland's most senior Roman Catholic has warned. In a sermon marking 40 years since the Abortion Act, Cardinal Keith O'Brien said pro-abortion MPs should consider their stance on receiving Communion. He said the abortion rate north of the border was equivalent to "two Dunblane massacres a day". The cardinal's opponents have accused him of using inflammatory language. We're told by statisticians that the equivalent of a classroom of children every day are being aborted in their mothers' womb Send us your comments Profile: 'Cardinal of Controversy' They said it was up to elected officials to decide such ethical issues without facing threats from church leaders. Abortion remains a reserved issue, legislated over by politicians at Westminster. Speaking at St Mary's Cathedral in Edinburgh, the cardinal urged decision-makers to stop supporting what he labelled an "unspeakable crime". And he called on voters to reject candidates who defend a "social evil". Cardinal O'Brien said: "We are killing - in our country - the equivalent of a classroom of kids every single day. "Can you imagine that? Two Dunblane massacres a day in our country going on and on. And when's it going to stop? "I can't change the teachings of Jesus Christ. I can't change the 10 Commandments. That's what I'm ordained to teach and to preach: 'Thou shalt not kill."' BBC religious affairs correspondent, Robert Pigott, said Cardinal O'Brien has been frustrated by what he sees as the marginalisation of Christian values in public affairs. He has embarked on his boldest intervention yet in political life, our correspondent said. His sermon attacked the 1967 act, describing the roughly seven million abortions in Britain since then as an "unspeakable crime" and the "wanton killing of innocents". What Cardinal O'Brien has done is bring it up in a manner that makes people stop and listen Editor, Scottish Catholic Observer The cardinal told the BBC: "We're told by statisticians that the equivalent of a classroom of children every day are being aborted in their mothers' womb - basically murdered in their mothers' womb." However, his intervention has angered some politicians. Jeremy Purvis, a Liberal Democrat member of the Scottish Parliament, said the cardinal was using "inflammatory" language. He said: "It is not right that we would be seen to be put under pressure, or indeed some members threatened, by a religious leader on what is a very sensitive issue." A Liberal Democrat spokesman in Westminster said abortion was a matter for the individual conscience and that Mr Purvis was giving his own personal view as a liberal politician. That view was echoed by the main parties in Scotland. Minister for public health, Shona Robison, said that the Scottish government was committed to improving Scotland's sexual health and reducing the number of unintended pregnancies through Respect and Responsibility, the national sexual health strategy. SNP MSP Michael Matheson said the Catholic Church would be "hypocritical" if it didn't speak out against abortion and those who supported it. He added: "I think it is perfectly reasonable for the Catholic leader in Scotland to effectively assert Catholic social teaching that is opposed to abortion. "If you had a situation where politicians who were voting in favour of abortion were then expected to be able to participate fully within a Catholic Mass then the church itself would be derelicting its responsibility to uphold its own teachings." Harry Conroy, editor of the Scottish Catholic Observer, said the paper fully supported Cardinal O'Brien's stance on abortion. Mr Conroy denied that the cardinal had used extreme language. "What Cardinal O'Brien has done is bring it up in a manner that makes people stop and listen," he said. Ann Furedi, chief executive of the British Pregnancy Advisory Service, said: "Abortion is a safe, legal and medically legitimate procedure, essential in safeguarding women's reproductive health. "Women should be able to make their own choices about their bodies and their future. The cardinal has every right to hold his views. He obviously doesn't have to have an abortion, or provide one."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6702107.stm cost reforms 'may cost NHS' 30 May 2007, 07:29 GMT 08:29 cost reforms 'may cost NHS' The OFT spent 18 months looking at drugs pricing Reforms of the drugs pricing system may cost the NHS money, an economist says. The Office of Fair Trading has proposed the cost of drugs to the NHS should be based on health impact, rather than the cost to manufacturers as happens now. The OFT had estimated the move could save the NHS £500m from its £7bn bill, the Health Economics journal reported. York University expert Professor Karl Claxton said the plan was well-founded but may cost the NHS more and said industry should cover any extra costs. OFT officials spent 18 months studying the drugs market before proposing a value-based pricing system , which would allow companies to charge higher prices for those drugs that delivered the greatest health benefits. Such a radical shake-up is bound to worry people within the industry, but most fears are unfounded Professor Karl Claxton, of York University At the moment, prices are determined by the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, which allows companies to set their own prices within broad profit constraints. The OFT suggested a move to value-based pricing could save £500m, although it did not fully establish how cost-effectiveness should be measured. But Professor Claxton said: "Under the new scheme, the NHS will only take on technologies if they are cost-effective - that means the health benefits of using the technology must be greater than health displaced elsewhere in the NHS.. "This will provide a powerful incentive for companies to concentrate on cost-effective delivery when they develop new therapies." But he said such an approach could actually lead to an increase in the drugs bill as companies try to produce treatments they get more money for. Professor Claxton added a system of safeguards should be built into the system whereby industry compensates the NHS if the drugs bill goes over an agreed limit, while the health service hands money back if revenue drops below a set amount. The OFT declined to comment on the claims, but the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said they were logical. A spokeswoman said: "We are not opposed to the system that is being proposed, it is just how it works in practice. "Current measures of cost-effectiveness do not take into account the impact of things such as a benefit of a person returning to work or not needing social care. "We are keen to see how the government responds to this." The government is expected to respond formally to the proposed value-based pricing system in the coming weeks. But a spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: "The government is looking carefully at how to maintain and accelerate the flow of life saving, effective drugs on to the market, at a fair price for the NHS, that also rewards the innovation of pharmaceutical companies. "We have been listening carefully to a wide range of views and will publish our response later in the year." and contacts on NHS healthcare to help you take action NHS 'pays too much to drug firms' 20 Feb 07 | Business Probe into cap on drugs profits 17 Sep 05 | Health NHS medicine cost control urged 28 Jul 05 | Scotland Office of Fair Trading
http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6701269.stm 'up Parkinson's risk' 29 May 2007, 23:18 GMT 00:18 'up Parkinson's risk' Some pesticides may be bad for human health Exposure to pesticides could lead to an increased risk of contracting Parkinson's disease, a study has found. Researchers discovered that high levels of exposure increased the risk by 39%, while even low levels raised it by 9%. However, the Aberdeen University researchers stressed that the overall risk of developing the disease remained small. In the UK, one person in 500 develops the incurable degenerative brain disease, or a similar illness. This doesn't prove that pesticides cause Parkinson's Disease - but does add to the weight of evidence of an association Dr Finlay Dick, Aberdeen University Symptoms often include unsteadiness and tremor in the hands or arms, often alongside difficulties with speech or movement. Other studies have pointed strongly towards exposure to pesticides being involved in some cases, with agricultural workers showing higher rates of the illness. The Aberdeen study, reported in the journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, involved 959 cases of parkinsonism, a term used to describe people with diagnoses of Parkinson's Disease, and other, similar conditions. They all answered questioned about their lifetime occupational and recreational exposure to a variety of chemicals, including solvents, pesticides, iron, copper and manganese. Some have suggested that the head injuries involved in boxing could be linked to Parkinson's, so the patients were also asked whether they had ever been knocked unconscious. The study included more general questions about family health history and tobacco use. All the replies were then compared to those from a group of people of similar age and sex who had not been diagnosed with Parkinson's. They revealed that while having a family history of Parkinson's was the clearest risk factor for developing the disease, exposure to pesticides also gave a clear increase. People who had been knocked out once were 35% more at risk, while being knocked out on more than one occasion appeared to increase the risk by two-and-a-half times. However, the researchers acknowledged that it was impossible to tell from the results whether the patients had been knocked out after falling as a result of their Parkinson's. Dr Finlay Dick, the lead researcher, said: "What we have shown in the study is that with increasing risk to exposure to pesticides, the risk of Parkinson's Disease increases. "This doesn't prove that pesticides cause Parkinson's Disease - but does add to the weight of evidence of an association." A spokesman for the Parkinson's Disease Society echoed this: "The important finding from this study is confirmation that Parkinson's is not caused by any one factor, but instead a combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental factors." Georgina Downs, from the UK Pesticides Campaign, which represents people in rural communities, said: "Considering many pesticides are neurotoxic, then it isn't surprising that study after study has found associations with various chronic neurological and neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's. "This is highly significant in relation to the long-term exposure of rural residents and communities living near sprayed fields." in link to Parkinson's 25 May 05 | Scotland 'Parkinson's was not the end for me' 20 Apr Mar 03 | Medical notes Occupational and Environmental Medicine

He said the sum would double the current US commitment and provide treatment for 2.5 million people. Mr Bush said the funding would also be aimed at preventing more than 12 million new infections. The president said his wife Laura would visit Africa next month as part of the US campaign against Aids. "When I took office, an HIV diagnosis in Africa's poorest communities was usually a death sentence," Mr Bush said. HIV/Aids around the world "Once again, the generosity of the American people is one of the great untold stories of our time." In 2003, the US Government approved a $15bn package over five years to fight the spread of Aids. The US Congress stipulated that a proportion of those funds must be spent on encouraging abstinence-until-marriage programmes. United Nations agencies say about 40 million people worldwide are infected with Aids or HIV. Almost three-quarters of deaths from Aids last year occurred in sub-Saharan Africa, and two-thirds of those living with HIV are found there. The number living with the virus has increased everywhere, with the most striking increases in East Asia and Central Asia/Eastern Europe. On Wednesday the World Health Organization urged affected countries to carry out HIV tests on everyone attending health centres unless they "opt out". It said 200 million people could benefit from the policy.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/health/6703701.stm organ donor card proposed 30 May 2007, 09:45 GMT 10:45 organ donor card proposed Organs for transplant are in short supply The EU could soon introduce an organ donor card covering all member states. The idea has been proposed by EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou, as a way to increase the number of organs available for transplant operations. A survey showed most Europeans support using donor cards - but only 12% actually carry one. Around 40,000 patients are on EU waiting lists for a transplant, and it is thought ten people a day die waiting in vain for a donor organ. The Commission's strategy paper suggests guidelines are drawn up to control the supply of surplus organs to countries in need. It also proposes creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals and making better use of living donors. Mr Kyprianou said: "Organ donations save lives. A European organ donor card, and common EU standards on the quality and safety of organ donations and transplants, could secure a sufficient and safe supply or organs." An opinion poll carried out for the European Commission in late 2006 and published on Wednesday said 81% of EU citizens "support the use of organ donor cards". It also found that 56% of Europeans are willing to donate one of their organs after they die. Support for the idea of donating an organ was highest in Sweden (81%), and lowest in Romania (27%). The Netherlands, Sweden and Ireland had the highest take-up of donor cards. However, use of donor cards was extremely limited in member states which have joined the EU since 2004. Dutch television will air a reality show this week in which a dying woman chooses a recipient for her kidneys. The EU executive and the Dutch government said the show was unethical. However, the maker, BNN argued the show highlights the shortage of organ donors. organ donor card proposed EU asks industry to fight obesity Sarkozy 'won't stop Turkey talks' EU sets new digital media rules A think tank argues against channelling aid through the EU Sarkozy excites and worries EU EU fails to excite Bulgarians Mark Mardell on the US plan to bring its missile shield to Europe THE UK AND EUROPE UK beach hygiene hailed in report Migrants 'want to settle in UK' A timeline of the EU Q&A: EU constitution's future
