The U.S. military said only one policeman was killed and eight were wounded. U.S. forces backed by helicopter gunships clashed with suspected al-Qaida gunmen in western Baghdad in an engagement that lasted several hours. The American military also reported the deaths of three more soldiers, two killed Wednesday in a roadside bombing in Baghdad and one who died of wounds from a roadside bomb attack northwest of the capital Tuesday. At least 122 American forces have died in May, the third-deadliest month of the Iraq conflict. U.S. forces also continued a search for five Britons who were kidnapped Tuesday in Baghdad, as well as for two of its soldiers who have been missing since a May 12 ambush south of the capital. The Fallujah suicide bomber killed at least 10 policemen in the attack, which occurred about 11 a.m., according to a police official in the city who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information. The rest of the dead were civilians, many of them in line seeking jobs as policemen. He said as many as 50 were wounded. Fallujah General Hospital had received 15 bodies and 10 wounded, according to a doctor there, who would not allow the use of his name because he feared retribution. The physician said he believed other casualties were taken to the nearby Jordanian Hospital and private clinics. A member of the Fallujah city council, who also asked for anonymity for fear of attack by insurgents, said there were at least 20 killed and 25 injured. The coordination of information in Fallujah was particularly difficult because the mobile telephone system has been working only sporadically. Maj. Jeff Pool of the Multi-National Force-West said the Anbar province governor's office and the provincial police put the total number of dead at one Iraqi policeman, with six police and two civilians wounded in Fallujah, 40 miles west of Baghdad. Police said the bomber detonated explosives in his vest at the third of four checkpoints, standing among recruits who were lining up to apply for jobs on the force. The center had only opened Saturday in a primary school in eastern Fallujah. The U.S. military and Iraqi army and police were running the center along with members of Anbar Salvation Council, a loose grouping of Sunni tribes that have banded together to fight al-Qaida. Police stations and recruiting posts have been a favorite target of Sunni insurgents and al-Qaida throughout the war. The fighting in western Baghdad's Amariyah neighborhood exploded after residents called for U.S. help. Members of al-Qaida, who consider the district part of their so-called Islamic State of Iraq, were preventing students from attending final exams, shooting randomly and forcing residents to stay in their homes, according to an official of the district council. He spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retribution from al-Qaida. Clashes continued into the afternoon, and the council official said the al-Qaida leader in the region, known as Haji Hameed, was killed and 45 other fighters detained. There was no immediate word on the fighting from the U.S. military. U.S. forces, meanwhile, pressed on with the search for five kidnapped Britons, and a procession of mourners, some of them women wailing and beating their chests, marched through Sadr City behind a small bus carrying the coffins of two people who police said were killed in a U.S. helicopter strike before dawn. The U.S. military said it had no report of airstrikes in Sadr City and that there were no civilian casualties in the second day of a search for the Britons, who were abducted Tuesday from a Finance Ministry data processing building in eastern Baghdad. A U.S. military statement, however, said U.S. and Iraqi forces had arrested two "members of the secret cell terrorist network" in Sadr City. There was no mention of fatalities. AP Television News videotape from Sadr City showed the coffins of the victims atop a small bus with men and women walking behind, crying. A young boy could be seen sitting next to the coffins. A car in the area was punctured with big holes, as if hit by an airstrike. A police officer in Sadr City, who refused to allow use of his name because he feared retribution, said the helicopter hit a house and car at 4:30 a.m., killing two elderly people sleeping on the roof of their home - a common practice in Iraq's extreme heat through late spring and summer. The officer said a 13-year-old boy was wounded. Also in Sadr City raids, which the U.S. has been conducting with a select unit of Iraqi army forces, Shiite cleric Abdul-Zahra al-Suwaidi claimed his home was raided and ransacked by American forces at 3 a.m. Thursday. The military said it had no report of the incident. Al-Suwaidi, who runs the Sadr City political office of radical cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, said he was sleeping elsewhere at the time of the raid, expecting that he would be targeted. He said his home was badly damaged and a small amount of money was taken. Dozens of U.S. Humvees and Bradley fighting vehicles had taken up positions around Sadr City at nightfall Wednesday. The five kidnapped Britons included four bodyguards working for the Montreal-based security firm GardaWorld and one employee of BearingPoint, a U.S.-based management consulting firm. In Washington, Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the military believed a helicopter that crashed Monday north of Baghdad was brought down by small-arms fire. The Islamic State of Iraq, an al-Qaida front group, claimed responsibility. Wiggins also said that more than 100 patrols a day were being launched to search for two missing troops who vanished after a May 12 ambush near Mahmoudiya, south of Baghdad. Four Americans and one Iraqi soldier were killed in the attack and the body of another American was later found in the Euphrates River. "Our determination and resolve to locate our missing soldiers is unwavering," Wiggins said.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/I/ISRAEL_PALESTINIANS?SITE=MSJAD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Abbas, Olmert to try to mend cease-fire Israel Steps Up Attacks on Hamas Abbas, Olmert to try to mend cease-fire Olmert weighing peace talks with Syria Israel bars burials in Old City cemetery Group: Gaza students need freer travel Peres to run for Israeli presidency Conflict in the Middle East CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) -- The Israeli and Palestinian leaders will meet next week in the Palestinian territories for the first time in a bid to restore a shattered cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, a senior Palestinian official said Thursday. The announcement came amid a slowdown in violence after two weeks of fighting between Palestinian rocket squads and Israeli forces. The fighting is expected to dominate the agenda of next week's meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. "The president is working night and day for a mutual, comprehensive cease-fire," said Nabil Abu Rdeneh, a top aide to Abbas. Abu Rdeneh said next week's summit, scheduled for June 7, "is expected in the Palestinian territories." Officials would not say where, but in the past they have mentioned the West Bank oasis of Jericho as the likely venue. While the two leaders have held a series of meetings over the past year, the Palestinians haven't hosted any of the gatherings. Olmert's spokeswoman, Miri Eisin, said a West Bank meeting is "a possibility," but said the date and location still have not been finalized. Olmert and Abbas promised Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in March to meet every two weeks with the aim of moving beyond day-to-day issues and begin discussing the outlines of a final peace agreement. However, the men have met just once since then, in April, and next week's talks will focus on the fighting. A five-month truce in Gaza unraveled earlier this month when the Hamas militant group began firing barrages of rockets into southern Israel, prompting Israel to respond with a series of airstrikes. More than 50 Palestinians, most of them militants, and two Israeli civilians have been killed. In the latest violence, Israeli aircraft attacked a Palestinian rocket-launching squad in northern Gaza. No injuries were reported. "We will actively pursue and hit these rocket launchers as well as those who operate them," said David Baker, an official in Olmert's office. Despite the flareup, there were signs of a slowdown in fighting. Hamas' military wing, which has been responsible for most of the recent rocket fire, said it has not launched a projectile in 48 hours. "Perhaps there is an unannounced cease-fire," Abu Rdeneh said. The smaller Islamic Jihad group claimed responsibility for Thursday's rocket fire. In a separate incident, Islamic Jihad said two members were slightly injured in an Israeli artillery strike. But the army denied involvement. Still, the number of rocket attacks has sharply dropped in recent days. Israel resolved on Wednesday to keep striking Gaza rocket squads and said it wasn't negotiating a truce with radical groups. Israeli officials believe the Israeli air campaign is the reason for the reduced rocket fire. Abbas, a moderate who favors peacemaking, has been pushing Hamas to restore the Gaza cease-fire. But he has been ineffective in halting militant attacks. Abbas' Fatah movement and Hamas are partners in the Palestinian coalition government. That partnership is extremely fragile, however, and Hamas began attacking Israel in an apparent attempt to halt a fresh wave of Palestinian infighting. Abbas has proposed a truce agreement that would commit Gaza militants to halt their rocket fire for a month to permit negotiations on a more comprehensive cease-fire including the West Bank. Militants have said a truce is out of the question as long as Israel keeps up its attacks and refuses to bring a truce to the West Bank, where it frequently conducts arrest raids. Israel has so far rejected the notion of applying the truce to West Bank, especially in light of the latest round of attacks from Gaza. Meanwhile, Hamas and Fatah are expected to meet next week to discuss shoring up an internal truce called after this month's infighting, which killed more than 50 Palestinians, said a senior Egyptian security official. Both sides have sent representatives to Cairo to individually speak to Egyptian mediators about the reasons for the latest outbreak in fighting, and the possibilities of coming to a truce with Israel. The two sides are expected to agree to form a committee that will include an impartial Egyptian observer to call judgment on violations of the truce currently holding between Palestinians, said Lt. Col. Burhan Hamad, head of the Gaza-based Egyptian security delegation. "But it's not a guarantee against fighting," Burhan warned. Although the internal truce has mostly held, mistrust runs deep. Both sides have welcomed Egyptian involvement. "We want to get out of mutual accusations through the refereeing of a third party, trusted by both sides, and that is the Egyptians," said Mohammed Dahlan, a Fatah strongman in Gaza, speaking on an Arab news television station.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/R/RUSSIA_PUTIN?SITE=MSJAD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Putin: U.S. has triggered new arms race Suspect: U.K. involved in ex-spy's death Putin: U.S. has triggered new arms race Russian diplomat: New arms race starting U.S. senators back missile defense plan Russia says new ICBM can beat any system Putin blasts U.S. missile defense plan Latest Photos from Russia (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that tests of new Russian missiles were a response to the planned deployment of U.S. missile defense installations and other forces in Europe, suggesting Washington has triggered a new arms race. In a clear reference to the United States, he harshly criticized "imperialism" in global affairs and warned that Russia will strengthen its military potential to maintain a global strategic balance. "It wasn't us who initiated a new round of arms race," Putin said when asked about Russia's missile tests at a news conference after talks in the Kremlin with Greek President Karolos Papoulias. Putin described Tuesday's tests of a new ballistic missile capable of carrying multiple nuclear warheads and a new cruise missile as part of the Russian response to the planned deployment of new U.S. military bases and missile defense sites in ex-Soviet satellites in Central and Eastern Europe. He assailed the United States and other NATO members for failing to ratify an amended version of the 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty, which limits the deployment of heavy non-nuclear weapons around the continent. "We have signed and ratified the CFE and are fully implementing it. We have pulled out all our heavy weapons from the European part of Russia to (locations) behind the Ural Mountains and cut our military by 300,000 men," Putin said. "And what about our partners? They are filling Eastern Europe with new weapons. A new base in Bulgaria, another one in Romania, a (missile defense) site in Poland and a radar in the Czech Republic," he said. "What we are supposed to do? We can't just sit back and look at that." Putin and other Russian officials have repeatedly rejected U.S. assurances that the planned missile defense installations are meant to counter a potential threat from nations such as Iran and pose no danger to Russia. Putin reaffirmed his warning that Russia would opt out of the CFE treaty altogether if NATO nations fail to ratify its amended version. "Either you ratify the treaty and start observing it, or we will opt out of it," Putin said. In remarks clearly directed against Washington, Putin blasted those "who want to dictate their will to all others regardless of international norms and law." "It's dangerous and harmful," he added. "Norms of the international law were replaced with political expediency. We view it as diktat and imperialism." Russia this week initiated an international conference to be held in Austria in early June to discuss the situation around the CFE treaty. Putin described the tests of new missiles conducted by Russia on Tuesday as a necessary response to the Western action. "There is no reason to fear these actions by Russia, they aren't aggressive. It's merely a response to tough and unfounded unilateral actions by our partners," he said. "These actions are aimed at preserving a global balance." In one missile test Tuesday, a prototype of new Russia's intercontinental ballistic missile, called the RS-24, was fired from a mobile launcher at the Plesetsk launch site in northwestern Russia and its test warhead landed on target 3,400 miles away on the Far Eastern Kamchatka Peninsula, officials said. Russia's military also tested a new cruise missile based on the existing short-range Iskander missile. "We will keep modernizing our potential," Putin said.

Landmine Education Becoming a Priority in Afghanistan A Children's Oasis in Kabul Rebirth of Afghan Art Kabul: Five Years After the Taliban's Fall 5 Americans among 7 dead in Afghan crash NATO says copter down in Afghanistan US general: Army avoids civilian deaths American remains in Afghan jail General: U.S. airstrikes killed Taliban Afghanistan (AP) -- NATO troops on Thursday secured the wreckage of a CH-47 Chinook helicopter apparently shot down by Taliban militants, an attack that killed everyone on board - five U.S. soldiers, a Canadian and a Briton, officials said. NATO said troops going to the crash site in southern Helmand province were ambushed by enemy fighters, and the unit called in an airstrike "to eliminate the enemy threat." It did not say if the troops were from the U.S.-led coalition, NATO's force or the Afghan army. One civilian was injured by gunfire. Maj. John Thomas, a spokesman for NATO's International Security Assistance Force, said there would be a full investigation into Wednesday's crash. "We will try to determine everything that happened and to fully investigate the site," he said. A U.S. military official, who insisted on speaking anonymously because the crash was still under investigation, said initial reports suggested the helicopter was hit with a rocket-propelled grenade. A purported Taliban spokesman, Qari Yousef Ahmadi, claimed in a phone call to The Associated Press that militants shot the helicopter down in the province, the world's largest opium poppy-growing region where combat has been heavy in recent months. Ahmadi did not offer any proof for his claim, but he specified the helicopter crashed in the Kajaki district hours before NATO reported that information. Kajaki is the site of a large U.S.-funded hydroelectric dam now being repaired so it can provide electricity to the southern city of Kandahar. British troops, who make up the bulk of the forces in Helmand province, have been engaged in fierce fighting around the dam protecting it. The Chinook, a heavy transport helicopter with two rotors, can carry about 40 soldiers plus a small crew. The fact it was flying at night suggested the aircraft might have been carrying troops on a nighttime air assault. The NATO force, which is responsible for a countrywide counterinsurgency campaign, has 37,000 soldiers, including about 14,000 Americans. There are 12,000 U.S. troops in the separate coalition, which trains the Afghan army and conducts Special Forces anti-terrorism operations. Helicopter crashes in Afghanistan have been relatively rare. A Chinook crashed in February in the southern province of Zabul, killing eight U.S. personnel. Officials ruled out enemy fire as the cause. In May 2006, another Chinook crashed attempting a nighttime landing on a small mountaintop in eastern Kunar province, killing 10 U.S. soldiers. In 2005, a U.S. helicopter crashed in Kunar, after apparently being hit by an RPG, killing 16 Americans. Also Thursday, Afghan and NATO forces battled suspected Taliban in Helmand's Sangin district. The Defense Ministry said "tens of enemies" were killed or wounded, but did not provide further detail. In western Farah province, insurgents attacked the Pusht Rod district late Wednesday, and ensuing clashes with police left 10 militants dead and 15 wounded, the Interior Ministry said. Retreating insurgents left behind one body and one wounded militant. Elsewhere, a senior military officer said the U.S. had "the Taliban on their heels" in Afghanistan. Brig. Gen. Perry Wiggins, deputy director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters that "the Taliban has suffered numerous losses and has suffered losses to their senior leadership over this past month" in southern and eastern Afghanistan. As a result, the Taliban has "reverted to asymmetric-type, small-scale, high-profile attacks," he said. Mullah Dadullah, a one-legged veteran who orchestrated an intensifying campaign of suicide attacks and beheadings, was killed in an operation in southern Afghanistan this month. He had been considered the top Taliban field commander. Still, Wiggins said that as the poppy harvest ends, more insurgents might join the battle. "So the fight's not over," he said. "But we'll continue to take the offensive through several of the operations we have in Afghanistan, and hopefully ... continue to inflict casualties on the Taliban." Associated Press writers Lolita Baldor in Washington and Noor Khan in Kandahar, Afghanistan, contributed to this report.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/UN_LEBANON_TRIBUNAL?SITE=MSJAD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT PM EDT Hezbollah, Syria denounce U.N. tribunal American U-N ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad (ZAHL'-may kah-LEEL'-zahd) says the tribunal will prevent future political violence. Hezbollah, Syria denounce U.N. tribunal Lebanese soldier killed by militants 20 suspects charged in Lebanon fighting Lebanese woman wounded by leftover bomb Fight is real test for Lebanese army Lebanon (AP) -- The militant Hezbollah group and its ally Syria denounced the United Nations on Thursday for its decision to establish a tribunal to prosecute the killers of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri. Meanwhile, officials in Beirut reopened the road where Hariri was killed by a suicide truck bomb in February 2005. Mayor Abdel-Monem al-Ariss said the spot would remain "a historic symbol in the heart of Beirut." The tribunal has been at the core of a political crisis between the pro-Western government in Beirut and the Hezbollah-led opposition that has erupted into street clashes in recent months, killing 11 people. Hezbollah called the U.N. Security Council decision a violation of Lebanon's sovereignty and "an attack on its internal affairs." "It amounts to a flagrant violation that makes the resolution illegal and illegitimate at the national and international level," the Shiite Muslim group said in a statement, adding that the resolution placed Lebanon under "international tutelage, without decision-making and sovereignty in an unprecedented development in the history of sovereign states." U.S.-backed Prime Minister Fuad Saniora had asked the Security Council earlier this month to establish the tribunal, citing the refusal of opposition-aligned Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri to convene a session to ratify the creation of the tribunal. Berri rejected these accusations Thursday, reflecting the opposition's bitterness over the government's move to take the issue to the U.N. Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, expressed skepticism over the tribunal's ability to "lead us to the truth" and identify the assassins. But he said he would support the court if it was "fair and impartial." Syria, which has been implicated in Hariri's assassination by the U.N., was also quick to criticize the establishment of the tribunal under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which deals with threats to international peace and allows military enforcement. Shortly after the vote late Wednesday, Syria's official news agency, citing an unidentified official, said: "The formation of the international court under Chapter 7 is considered as a degradation of Lebanon's sovereignty." Syrian newspapers on Thursday also criticized the decision as an American-Israeli effort to exact revenge on Damascus, an opponent of both. Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied involvement in the assassination and threatened not to cooperate with the tribunal if it infringes on Syrian national sovereignty. Police cleared roadblocks in front of the 328-yard stretch of road where Hariri and 22 others were killed. The seaside boulevard had been closed for more than two years while the U.N. scoured the ground, adjacent buildings and the nearby Mediterranean Sea for evidence. Among the first to drive through was a passenger minivan, whose driver stopped, got out of the vehicle, knelt and kissed the ground, saying: "God have mercy on your soul." Earlier, Carole Farhat, who survived the bombing two years ago, watched as laborers filled the bomb crater with gravel and paved over it. She said she was glad to be alive "to enjoy this moment." "I've come to see the spot where I was seconds away from death. It might be a good sign for Lebanon and for us," said Farhat, who was thrown in the air by the bombing as she crossed the road. She lost much of her hearing and sustained injuries to her eyes. Daniel Germani, an engineer who was also injured in the bombing, said the reopening of the road would allow his team to repair the famous St. George Hotel, which was severely damaged in the blast. Five hotel employees were killed and eight were wounded, he said. He estimated damages to the hotel at $10 million, saying they had yet to receive compensation. The U.N. resolution gives the Lebanese parliament a last chance to establish the tribunal itself. If it doesn't act by June 10, the U.N. decision will automatically "enter into force." Saad Hariri, leader of the parliamentary majority and the son of the late prime minister, and Saniora have extended a hand to the opposition after the tribunal's approval. But ratification by the parliament so far appears unlikely entangled. Saad Hariri said after the vote late Wednesday the decision was a turning point in Lebanon that would protect the country from further assassinations. The vote is a "victory the world has given to oppressed Lebanon and a victory for an oppressed Lebanon in the world," he said, holding back tears at the end of his televised speech. Saniora, a longtime confidant of Rafik Hariri, also called the tribunal "a triumph for Lebanon against injustice, crime and tyranny." He urged the Lebanese to put their differences behind, saying the approval of the tribunal was a "positive step" for renewed dialogue.

Suspect: U.K. involved in ex-spy's death Putin: U.S. has triggered new arms race Russian diplomat: New arms race starting U.S. senators back missile defense plan Russia says new ICBM can beat any system Putin blasts U.S. missile defense plan Latest Photos from Russia into Poisoning Death of Former Spy Suspect: U.K. involved in ex-spy's death Britain seeks suspect in poisoning death Kremlin foe: Russian suspect in danger Litvinenko docu to premiere at Cannes 1998 tape shows Russian ex-spy fearful MOSCOW (AP) -- The Russian businessman whom Britain has named as a suspect in the killing of ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko claimed Thursday that he has evidence of British special services' involvement in the poisoning death. Andrei Lugovoi, himself a former KGB agent, said Litvinenko tried to recruit him to gather compromising materials about Russian President Vladimir Putin for MI6, Britain's foreign intelligence agency. He claimed that British security services were unhappy with Litvinenko for boasting of his contacts with senior MI6 officials and spilling secrets. "It's hard to get rid of the thought that Litvinenko was an agent who got out of the secret service's control and was eliminated," Lugovoi told a news conference. "Even if it was not done by the secret service itself, it was done under its control or connivance." A British government security official, who demanded anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case, said the allegations were untrue. Britain's Foreign Office, responsible for MI6, declined to comment. Lugovoi claimed he had evidence of his allegations but that he would only give details to Russian investigators. Britain last week said it had enough evidence to charge Lugovoi, who also worked for the KGB and its main successor agency the FSB, in the November killing of Litvinenko. Litvinenko, who died of poisoning by the rare radioactive isotope polonium-210, had fled to Britain several years earlier after becoming a strong critic of the Kremlin and received British citizenship. Lugovoi and another Russian had met in London with Litvinenko on Nov. 1, the day Litvinenko said he became ill. Britain has requested Lugovoi's extradition, but Russia has refused, saying its constitution does not permit it. Lugovoi dismissed the British accusations against him as an attempt to divert attention from Litvinenko's contacts with British spy services. He claimed Litvinenko tried to recruit him during one of several business trips to Britain last year. At one point, he said, Litvinenko gave him a book for coding communications and a cell phone for contact with his British spy handlers. He said he refused to betray his country. "In conversations with me, Litvinenko often went beyond his role as a recruitment agent and told me many things he shouldn't have said," Lugovoi said. "I got an impression that he was really getting out of British secret services' control. He believed that the British undervalued him and paid him too little for his service." Oleg Gordievsky, a former top KGB spy who worked for MI6 and defected to Britain, dismissed Lugovoi's claims as "silly fantasies." He said Litvinenko had worked for domestic branches of the KGB and post-Soviet security structures and was of no interest to British intelligence. "MI6 not interested in information about the domestic service," Gordievsky, who was a friend of Litvinenko, said on British Broadcasting Corp. television. "Litvinenko was not needed. He made signals that he might be prepared, but they said, 'We don't need you,' so he didn't work for MI6." Lugovoi's statements would be "thoroughly investigated" by the Russian Prosecutor- General's office as part of its own inquiry into Litvinenko's killing, spokeswoman Anna Pozdnyakova said. She said prosecutors were already checking several similar claims he made previously under questioning. Konstantin Kosachev, the Kremlin-connected head of the foreign affairs committee in the lower house of the Russian parliament, urged British authorities to help investigate the "very serious accusations against British secret services." "I do believe they will take these new versions as seriously as it should be done," Kosachev said on Russia Today television. Lugovoi also claimed that Boris Berezovsky, a Russian billionaire living in self-exile in London who is among Putin's most powerful political foes, might have been involved in Litvinenko's death. Lugovoi said Litvinenko was angry after Berezovsky, his longtime friend and patron, cut a living allowance he paid Litvinenko. Lugovoi claimed that Litvinenko told him he could prove that the tycoon received political asylum in Britain under false pretenses. Russia has long sought Berezovsky's extradition to face charges of financial crimes that date back to the 1990s. Berezovsky says the charges are politically motivated. Lugovoi claimed that Berezovsky, who briefly served as a deputy secretary of Russia's presidential Security Council during the 1990s, also was an MI6 agent and gave British intelligence sensitive information about Russia. Berezovsky called Lugovoi's allegations "absolutely false." "MI6 absolutely knows who are agents for its organization, it knows Berezovsky is not on that list," Berezovsky told is not the story of Lugovoi, this is the story the Kremlin wants to present to the world. The Kremlin in a corner. Putin is in a corner." Associated Press writers D'Arcy Doran and David Stringer contributed to this report from London.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/S/SOUTH_AFRICA_BLAIR?SITE=MSJAD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Blair: G-8 must keep pledges to Africa British Prime Minister Tony Blair says peaceful coexistence between religions can help prevent terrorism. Historian claims to ID Jack the Ripper Sudan: Sanctions are `death sentence' Sudan: U.S. sanctions over Darfur unfair Gunmen in Darfur kill U.N. peacekeeper U.N. peacekeeper killed in Darfur Editor, columnist detained in Sudan South Africa (AP) -- Nelson Mandela hailed Tony Blair on Thursday as "very good friend" to Africa for the priority he has given the continent, while the outgoing British prime minister called on rich countries to fulfill aid pledges to the region. Blair, ending his farewell tour of Africa, said the Group of Eight summit in Germany next week must follow through on commitments made two years ago, when Britain made Africa the focus of its presidency of the G-8. "We need each G-8 to be bolder than the last," Blair said in a speech at the University of South Africa. "If we give up, we will lose the chance in this continent, rich as it is though its people are often poor, for our values to take root. It would be a calamitous misjudgment and we should not make it." Blair said Mandela, who led the struggle against apartheid and became South Africa's first black president, embodied the best of the continent. The two men met at Mandela's foundation in Johannesburg. Blair "has been a very good friend to Africa, and I know his commitment will continue in his retirement," Mandela said. "I know that your energy, passion and youth can still play a big role in international affairs." Blair said both the West and Africa faced two possible paths. "One is chosen by countries like South Africa, Ghana, Tanzania, Mozambique, Botswana and many others, reinforcing economic growth with good governance and the stamping out of violence and corruption," he said. "The other, the path of Zimbabwe or Sudan, where bad government and violent oppression send the country's economy spiraling down." "Our choice is to support the good. Africa's challenge is to eliminate the bad," he said. Blair said debt-relief programs have helped countries like Zambia provide free basic health care, while funding from Britain and the West have helped improve education and distribute anti-AIDS drugs to hundreds of thousands. Blair has won praise from some African leaders, while others say Britain and other Western countries have not fulfilled lofty promises and high-sounding declarations. In his speech, Blair called for tougher action against Sudan over the violence in Darfur. Britain has said it would support Washington's proposal for a U.N. sanctions resolution against the Sudanese government. Despite months of international pressure, Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir has resisted the deployment of a 22,000-member joint U.N.-African Union force to quell a four-year conflict that has left more than 200,000 people dead. "It is wrong that President Bashir, intent on bombing his way to a solution, is determined to obstruct any effort made to reinforce the Africa Union's ability to improve security and stability," he said. "We must offer President Bashir a choice. Engage with us on a solution. Or, if you reject responsibility for the people of Darfur, then we will ... put to a vote sanctions against the regime," he said. Blair also appealed for renewed pressure on Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, accused by the West of becoming increasingly repressive and leading his country to economic ruin. The prime minister was due to meet later Friday with South African President Thabo Mbeki for talks likely to include the crisis in neighboring Zimbabwe. Mbeki, who is southern Africa's mediator on Zimbabwe, has kept to his long-standing policy of quiet diplomacy, but that has yet to persuade Mugabe to embrace political and economic reform.

The Saudi government identified the man who died Wednesday as Abdul Rahman Maadha al-Amry. A spokesman for the kingdom's Interior Ministry, Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, said it was too early to judge how al-Amry died. The U.S. military has not confirmed the detainee's identity or explained how it arrived at the conclusion that he probably committed suicide. "The actual cause of death is under investigation," Southern Command spokesman Jose Ruiz said by telephone from Miami on Thursday. Ruiz said the man was held at the maximum-security Camp 5. Guards at the U.S. Naval Base in southeast Cuba found the detainee unresponsive and not breathing in his cell Wednesday afternoon, the Southern Command announced Wednesday. It would be the fourth suicide at Guantanamo since the prison camp opened in January 2002. On June 10, 2006, two Saudi detainees and one Yemeni hanged themselves with sheets. Prisoners in Camp 5, which is similar to the highest-security U.S. prisons, are kept in individual, solid-wall cells and allowed outside for only two hours a day of recreation in an enclosed area. Wells Dixon, a defense attorney who met with detainees at Camp 5 last month, said many showed signs of desperation. "I can assure you that it is hell on earth," Dixon said. "You can see the despair on the faces of detainees. It's transparent." Other critics said detainees are frustrated at being held indefinitely without charges. "You have five and a half years of desperation there with no legal way out," said Michael Ratner, president of the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, which represents hundreds of Guantanamo detainees. "Sadly, it leads to people being so desperate they take their own lives." Lawyer Julia Tarver Mason, whose firm represents eight Saudi detainees at Guantanamo, said the government so far has declined to tell her if the man who died was among her clients. There are about 80 detainees from Saudi Arabia held at Guantanamo. "They are in the care of the United States government and that should mean that deaths should not occur," Mason said. The death came as Guantanamo prepares to hold pretrial hearings for two detainees in military tribunals. One of the detainees, Canadian Omar Khadr, fired his American attorneys on Wednesday, leaving him without defense counsel, his former U.S. military attorney told is still to be arraigned Monday. He and Salim Ahmed Hamdan, a Yemeni who also faces a hearing Monday, are among only three of the roughly 380 Guantanamo prisoners to be charged with a crime. The third, David Hicks, was convicted of aiding al-Qaida and returned to his native Australia. Khadr was 15 when he was captured in Afghanistan during a firefight in which he allegedly killed a U.S. Army special forces soldier with a grenade. "He doesn't trust American lawyers, and I don't particularly blame him," said U.S. Marine Lt. Col. Colby Vokey, who was taken off the case Wednesday. "The United States is responsible for his interrogation and his treatment under a process that is patently unfair." Many of the "enemy combatants" at the isolated prison camp have been held for more than five years. In most cases, the military accuses them of having links to al-Qaida or the Taliban. The former commander of the detention facilities, Navy Rear Adm. Harry Harris, described earlier suicides as acts of "asymmetric warfare" - an effort to increase condemnation of the prison. A cultural adviser was helping the military handle the remains. "The remains of the deceased detainee are being treated with the utmost respect," the military said. Associated Press writers Andrew O. Selsky and Ben Fox contributed to this story.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/V/VENEZUELA_CHAVEZ_VS_TV?SITE=MSJAD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Venezuela uproar concerns Carter Center Delayed: Latin America's Dirty Wars Leaning Left: Political Changes in Latin America Venezuela uproar concerns Carter Center U.S.: Dead detainee was of high value Tropical Storm Barbara forms off Mexico Novelist Garcia Marquez goes home Bolivian police find big cocaine factory CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- The Carter Center called for dialogue Thursday between President Hugo Chavez and opponents protesting his decision to force an opposition TV channel off the air, while calm returned to the streets after three days of demonstrations. The Atlanta-based organization founded by former President Jimmy Carter expressed concern about the potential for escalating violence after the government halted broadcasts by Radio Caracas Television on Sunday. Police have repeatedly clashed with angry crowds hurling rocks and bottles since Chavez refused to renew the station's broadcast license. "Healthy democracies require spaces for political dialogue and debate to allow divisions about the future direction of the country to be addressed in peaceful ways," the Carter Center said. In parts of Caracas, meanwhile, Venezuelans walked to work along sidewalks littered with rocks and debris from the protests. Opposition leader Manuel Rosales on Wednesday demanded the release of dozens of students jailed during clashes between protesters and police. Rosales - the governor of western Zulia state who was defeated by Chavez in December elections - said protesters are demanding not only free speech but also the right to protest "peacefully and democratically." He noted that a home video broadcast on the Globovision network showed unidentified men in the doorway of a government office, apparently Chavez allies, firing guns at unseen targets. "For that there is no justice?" he asked. As he spoke, about 8,000 student protesters chanting "freedom!" marched through Caracas. Although the march was generally peaceful, there were several scuffles between students and Chavez supporters. The Carter Center, which has observed past elections here, said it is concerned that "non-renewal of broadcast concessions for political reasons will have a chilling effect on free speech." "A plurality of opinions should be protected," it said. "The right of dissent must be fiercely defended by every democratic government." Chavez accused RCTV of helping incite a failed coup in 2002 and violating various broadcast laws. He said his decision to replace it with a new state-funded public channel, TVES, was a step toward "democratizing" the airwaves.
http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/R/RICE?SITE=MSJAD&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT AM EDT Rice holds line on Iran nuclear program Austria (AP) -- Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice held the hard U.S. line against concessions to Iran over its nuclear program Thursday and renewed a conditional offer to talk to the clerical regime on any subject. Iran also refused to budge ahead of talks Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official. Asked if it is time to change tactics in the world's nuclear standoff with Iran, Rice ruled out the idea of dropping a key precondition. "I think it's time for Iran to change its tactics," Rice said. There is increasing sentiment in Europe that world powers trying to engage Iran should drop the demand that Iran halt, or suspend in diplomatic parlance, disputed nuclear activities before bargaining on a package of incentives could begin. "The international community is united on what Iran should do, which is to suspend; to demonstrate that it is in fact not seeking a nuclear weapon under cover of civilian nuclear power," Rice said. She spoke during a press conference with Austria's foreign minister, a year to the day after she made a dramatic outreach to longtime adversary Iran. The offer to talk "anytime, any place," was intended to inject new life into an ebbing European diplomatic effort to turn back Iran's advancing nuclear program. "I think the question isn't why won't we talk to Tehran. The question is why doesn't Tehran want to talk to us." Iran did not accept Rice's offer for the first Cabinet-level direct talks in nearly three decades because of the condition to stop enriching uranium. Enriched uranium is an ingredient for both the peaceful nuclear power Iran claims it wants or for the illicit weapons program that Washington suspects. "I repeat again that if Iran is prepared to take that course then we are prepared to change 27 years of American policy and sit with Iran to talk about whatever Iran would like to talk about," Rice said. "But that can't be done when Iran continues to ... try to perfect technologies that are going to lead to a nuclear weapon." Since Rice's offer, the Bush administration has embarked on a more cautious outreach to Iran. U.S. and Iranian diplomats have met twice to discuss the spiral of violence in Iraq. The United States accuses Iran of arming insurgents in next-door Iran, but Iran denies it. The disputed nuclear issue hangs over those limited talks. Tehran recently suggested a readiness to discuss a partial suspension of uranium enrichment, but the U.S. and key allies rejected the overture and Iran pulled back from the idea for starting talks on its nuclear program, diplomats said Wednesday With both sides back at their hard-line stances, an exploratory meeting Thursday between Iran's chief international negotiator and the European Union's senior foreign policy official was unlikely to make substantial headway, the diplomats told another sign of defiance, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad boasted that his country's military has become so strong that no adversary would risk an attack. "We have passed our point of vulnerability," he told Iranian state television. Later Thursday, Rice skipped on opportunity to continue a public argument with Russia over U.S. plans to base a missile interceptor system in Europe. Speaking at the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Rice did not mention Russia or the controversy that has dominated increasingly troubled U.S.-Russian relations in recent months. Rice referred to the Cold War roots of the organization, begun as a bulwark against the Soviet Union, and said its expansion to include all manner of nations proves her theory that some historical events that seem impossible one day become inevitable. "That is for me, a great benefit and a great inspiration in a world that is in a great deal of turmoil now," Rice said.
