http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6706805.stm | Whale meeting condemns Japan hunt GMT 07:58 meeting condemns Japan hunt Environment correspondent, BBC News website, Anchorage, Alaska Sea Shepherd protesters disrupted Japan's Antarctic hunt this year The International Whaling Commission's annual meeting has passed a resolution condemning Japan's scientific hunting programme in the Antarctic. Japan catches nearly 1,000 whales there each year in the name of research. After an acrimonious debate, a large number of countries refused to vote, saying the resolution was illegitimate. There was, however, consensus support for a motion censuring environmental groups which try to hinder Japan's Antarctic programme. Both Greenpeace and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society have tried to block the programme in recent years, culminating in a damaging collision between Japanese and Sea Shepherd vessels in the recent Antarctic season for which each party blames the other. It was just about the only sign of common ground in a day marked by the entrenched positions and political posturing which has bedevilled this organisation for years. 'Stain on the commission' Any International Whaling Commission (IWC) member is entitled to hunt whales for scientific research, but anti-whaling countries view the size and scope of Japan's programmes in the Antarctic and north Pacific as going far beyond what was envisaged when the IWC's constitution, the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, was drawn up in 1946. Resolutions calling for a halt have materialised regularly. Japan is not obliged to comply with the IWC vote "Every scientific catch is a stain on the record of this commission," said Monaco's whaling commissioner Frederic Briand. "The best thing Japan could do is to reduce the size of its scientific whaling programmes around the world." The IWC's scientific committee recently reviewed Japan's Antarctic programme, and New Zealand's conservation minister Chris Carter was not too impressed with their conclusions. Japanese hunters "killed 7,000 whales over 18 years, and couldn't even decide how many whales there are," he fumed. This was in marked contrast to the St Kitts commissioner Cedric Liburd, who said: "This research provided significant data enabling us to understand the structure and abundance of whale populations. Every scientific catch is a stain on the record of this commission "I find [this resolution] extremely disturbing, vexatious and in some ways irrelevant," he said. "It is frivolous, devoid of action and meaningless." Virtually all of the pro-whaling bloc abstained from the vote, leading to a majority of 40 to 2. It makes no material difference, as Japan is not obliged to comply. Nevertheless, it is viewed by environmental groups as an important weapon in the battle for hearts and minds. Environmental organisations Greenpeace and Sea Shepherd came under fire themselves in a resolution co-ordinated by Japan and New Zealand. It was the only concrete sign so far of the common ground which both sides said they were seeking before the meeting convened. People on both sides of the debate talk about their views The resolution, which says that member governments "do not condone, and in fact condemn, any actions that are a risk to human life and property in relation to the activities of vessels at sea," passed by consensus. "We maintain that our protests are peaceful and non-violent," commented Shane Rattenbury of Greenpeace International. "Greenpeace has 35 years of history of being non-violent; but I'm sure the Japanese government will attempt to wave it in our face and say 'you shouldn't be undertaking these protests'." Sea Shepherd's record is rather different, having been implicated in attacks on whaling vessels spanning more than two decades. It is notable that while Greenpeace is allowed into the meeting here, Sea Shepherd is not. Parts of the resolution can also be interpreted as a rebuke to Japan, particularly an injunction to "have regard to protecting... the fragile Antarctic environment." The meeting looked like running late into its penultimate evening, with several major issues unresolved.

Audience numbers were down by 800,000 compared with 7 million viewers for the start of the seventh series in 2006. Following the end of ITV's British Soap Awards and BBC One's The Apprentice, the audience peaked at 8 million. It is the first time an all-female house has launched the show, but a male housemate will join them shortly. Viewing figures were well above average for the C4 time slot, with the reality show drawing 26 per cent of available viewers. Channel 4's commissioning editor for Big Brother, Angela Jain, said: "This heralds a fantastic start to Big Brother." The show opened with an official apology, ordered by Ofcom, over C4's handling of the race row involving celebrity contestants Jade Goody, Danielle Lloyd and Jo O'Meara and their treatment of Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty. House rules for this series have been updated to warn against bullying and to make clear that offensive remarks on the grounds of race, religion or sexuality are unacceptable. Carole received the biggest cheer of the night from waiting crowds The 11 contestants include the first set of twins ever to enter the house, a member of the Women's Institute and a Victoria Beckham wannabe. Charley, an unemployed former lap dancer, was greeted with boos and chants of "get a job" by the crowd as she arrived at the house, at Elstree Studios in Hertfordshire. Political protester Carole received the loudest cheer of the night. A single man is expected to enter the house on Friday to join the contest for the £100,000 prize. It is rumoured that the female contestants will choose from three possible contenders.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6707315.stm | Middle East | Hezbollah condemns Hariri court GMT 16:52 condemns Hariri court Hariri's killing sparked protests that pressured Syria to leave Lebanon Lebanese opposition party Hezbollah has condemned a UN Security Council vote to set up a tribunal to try suspects in the killing of Rafik Hariri. The ex-PM and 22 other people died in a huge car bombing in Beirut in 2005. A UN inquiry has suggested that Syrian and Lebanese intelligence forces played a role - which Syria denies. The pro-Syrian Hezbollah group, which has previously blocked a parliamentary vote on the plan, said the UN decision violated Lebanese sovereignty. "The resolution, as much as it constitutes a violation of the Lebanese state and an attack on its internal affairs, it is contrary to legal rules and the charters and principles of the United Nations and the objectives for which it was established to achieve," the statement said. The resolution was "illegal and illegitimate at the national and international level", the group added. Lebanon's pro-Syrian president, Emile Lahoud, has said he fears the tribunal will cause fresh division in the country. Syria has also condemned the decision. Hezbollah's opposition to the tribunal has so far meant that Lebanese PM Fouad Siniora has been unable to get a vote backing the plan through parliament. The UN resolution gives the Lebanese parliament one more opportunity to back the plan. The ratification of the international tribunal does not, and should not, be considered as a victory for one party over another Lebanese party If the parliament does not ratify the tribunal by 10 June, the Security Council may independently authorise a tribunal, as it did in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. The issue of the tribunal has been at the centre of a political crisis in Lebanon which has seen the opposition withdraw its ministers from the cabinet, and attempt to bring down the government through street protests. The Syrian ambassador at the UN, Bashar Jaafari, condemned the UN vote. "Definitely this is something that goes against the interests of the Lebanese people and Lebanon as a whole," he told reporters after the vote. The Syrian government has in the past threatened not to co-operate with an international tribunal. NEXT STEPS FOR TRIBUNAL Lebanon must ratify tribunal by 10 June, or UN could push ahead regardless May take about a year to establish court Tribunal to be held in undetermined neutral location Syria has threatened not to co-operate with the tribunal The resolution was adopted by 10 votes to zero, with five abstentions from Russia, China, South Africa, Indonesia and Qatar. Syria has always strongly denied any involvement in Mr Hariri's death, but in 2005 it withdrew its troops from Lebanon after a presence of 29 years, following massive domestic and international pressure after the assassination of Mr Hariri. Four pro-Syrian Lebanese generals have been under arrest for more than a year, accused of involvement. The Syrian government position is that the tribunal will be a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and that it will further undermine stability there. As far as its alleged involvement in the assassination is concerned, Syria says that if one of its citizens was to be formally accused of involvement, that person could be tried only by Syrian courts. Saad Hariri, the son of the assassinated politician, said the tribunal was a turning point for the country and "an opportunity for all Lebanese to unite". Speaking live on Lebanese television, he said the time had come for justice. Some of the abstaining ambassadors at the Security Council objected to the reference in the resolution to Chapter Seven of the UN Charter, used in cases of threats to international peace and security. The issue of the tribunal has caused deep divisions in Lebanon However, the US and its allies argued that only Chapter Seven resolutions were legally enforceable. There is a hope in Lebanon that the resolution will end a long, sad history of unpunished political assassinations, says the BBC's Kim Ghattas in Beirut. Reporting from the Damascus, Magdi Abdel Hadi says the new resolution is likely to increase the tension between Syria and the Western-backed Lebanese government of Mr Siniora. It is also likely to increase polarisation inside Lebanon itself. People in Lebanon are on edge after a series of bomb attacks last week and an ongoing bloody standoff in northern Lebanon between the army and militants from the Fatah al-Islam group. A Lebanese army spokesman said a soldier was killed on Thursday by sniper fire from Fatah al-Islam militants inside the Nahr al-Bared Palestinian refugee camp. At least 80 people have been killed in the fighting, including 35 soldiers, 20 civilians and at least 25 militants. condemns Hariri court Press divided on Hariri tribunal UN approves Hariri murder court Hariri probe 'progress on motive' The US, Iran and Saudi Arabia battle to gain influence in Lebanon.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6707593.stm | Number of failing schools up 5% GMT 12:00 of failing schools up 5% Some 1% of schools are judged to be failing The number of schools in England judged to be failing has risen by 5% since last term, education inspectors say. By the end of March this year, 256 schools were in "special measures" compared to just 243 at the end of December - a rise of 13 schools. Ofsted said the rise was partly because there were fewer schools in a position to be removed from this category. Schools in special measures can be closed if they do not improve fast enough. Just 1% are in this category. Schools that used to escape closer attention may now find themselves in special measures By the end of the spring term, 179 primary schools were in special measures, eight more than at the end of December. Four more secondaries were in special measures, taking the total to 52, with one more special needs school also in the failing category. Eleven special schools were judged to be failing, up one from December. The rest were pupil referral units - 14 of which were judged to be failing. A spokeswoman for Ofsted said: "The number of schools removed from special measures in the spring term 2007 was lower than in previous terms because very few schools were made subject to special measures in the spring and summer terms 2005. "It normally takes around two years for schools to improve sufficiently to be removed from special measures." However the most recent increase follows a rise of 16.8% - or 35 schools - from 208 at the end of August 2006 to 243 at the end of December. Schools Minister Jim Knight said the government had halved the number of failing schools since 1997-1998. He also highlighted the fact that the figures show that compared with last term overall there are fewer schools in categories of concern. Until August 2005 categories of concern were those in special measures, with serious weakness, underachieving schools and secondary schools with inadequate sixth forms. From September 2005 these categories changed to those in special measures and those requiring significant improvement. Mr Knight added: "This is a promising trend despite the fact we raised the bar on inspection in autumn 2005. "The new, tougher inspection framework means there is no room for 'coasting schools'. "Schools that used to escape closer attention may now find themselves in special measures. "Our reforms to tackle failing schools demand radical action from the school and the local authority to turn the school around quickly." Shadow education secretary David Willetts said the figures were more evidence of the "pressing need" to focus on raising standards in state schools. "It demonstrates why it is right to concentrate on creating more good schools so we can improve opportunities for all pupils, particularly those from poorer backgrounds, who are currently being failed by the system," he added. Liberal Democrat education spokeswoman Sarah Teather said the government was running out of excuses for its inability to deal with failing schools. She added that schools with more underachieving pupils should be given extra funds so they have the resources to deal with those pupils' additional needs. power to search for knives Number of failing schools up 5% Enforced schooling to 18 opposed
http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6702983.stm BBC SPORT | Football | Internationals | Terry determined to save McClaren GMT 12:30 determined to save McClaren Terry (left) will lead out England against Brazil and Estonia England v Brazil (Fri 1 June) Live on BBC ONE from 1930 BST & Radio Five Live Estonia v England (Wed 6 June) Live on Sky Sports and BBC Radio Five Live, highlights on BBC ONE England skipper John Terry has admitted coach Steve McClaren could lose his job if they lose in Estonia. England face Brazil in a friendly on Friday before a must-win Euro 2008 qualifier in Estonia five days later. "Will there be a question mark over him if England lose? Possibly. But we are not thinking like that," Terry said. "We need to go there and get a win. It is as simple as that. We are fully behind the manager and we are going to do our best to keep him in his job." Interview: England captain John Terry Interview: England striker Michael Owen England head to Estonia for Wednesday's game in fourth place in Group E and knowing only a win will do after some disappointing results. Your thoughts on Terry's comments Terry added: "We need to go there and perform. The Brazil game is a chance for us to get our sharpness back and make sure we are ready for the game on Wednesday." Terry is pleased to have David Beckham - the player he replaced as skipper after the World Cup last summer - back in the squad. He said: "It is great to have him back. We all know his quality and he has brought that into training and we look forward to seeing him training. "It is not strange for me. We are all important players in the squad and it is just great to have him back. "I had a few chats with Steve and the form he has been in is exceptional since he came back from injury. It couldn't go unnoticed. The manager has brought him in and rightly so." I will stand or fall by this decision Steve McClaren on Beckham's recall McClaren has praised David Beckham for earning a recall to the national squad. Real Madrid midfielder Beckham, 32, was named in a McClaren squad for the first time - his first inclusion since the 2006 World Cup. McClaren said: "He showed great hunger and desire to get back. He didn't moan, just got his head down and worked hard. "I have not made this decision for anyone, it is about form. He is the fittest I have seen for a long time." Beckham last played for England in the World Cup quarter-final defeat against Portugal last July, after which he resigned the captaincy and has not been selected in any of McClaren's nine previous squads. He was also dropped by Real Madrid in January after agreeing to join Major League Soccer side LA Galaxy when his contract with the Spanish side runs out at the end of the season. But coach Fabio Capello eventually recalled Beckham and he has produced some stunning displays to lead Real to the top of La Liga, with two games left. McClaren added: "You've got to respect the work Fabio Capello is doing at Real Madrid. "He has had the same problems as me. He had no hesitation about bringing David back when he was on form and that has changed the fortunes of Real Madrid. "I would be very foolish to ignore that. I have played against them a couple of times and scored both times Michael Owen on facing Brazil "After one match, Capello said David ran 15 kilometres and the next highest figure was 12km. In another he ran 80 yards in the last minute to create a winning goal. "I will stand or fall by this decision but anyone who has watched David closely over the last few weeks and months must understand why he is in the squad." Also returning to the England squad is Michael Owen, who has been ruled out since the World Cup after injury. The Newcastle striker is delighted to be back playing for his country and taking on the might of Brazil at Wembley. He said: "I feel fine. It feels great to be back in the fold. I played in the England B game last week but obviously this is the real stuff now. "The way Brazil play, the stars they produce, their kit - everything about them means you couldn't wish for a more exciting game to start off with at Wembley. "I have played against them a couple of times and scored both times." Owen scored in a 1-1 friendly draw with Brazil in one of the last England's last games at the old Wembley stadium in 2000 and in their World Cup quarter-final defeat in 2002. He also scored against Brazil for England Under-15s on his first ever appearance at Wembley.

It means all four of the world's major music firms are now YouTube partners. The terms of the agreement should eventually allow users to incorporate recordings by EMI artists into their own projects. The deal follows a string of lawsuits by companies who accuse YouTube of allowing its users to pirate their copyrighted works. The biggest threat comes from entertainment giant Viacom Media which is suing YouTube for $1bn (£505m). The US group - which owns MTV and Nickelodeon - claims that the website uses its shows illegally. "We're excited to add EMI Music's stellar roster of artists' content to our site and make it available to our community," said Chad Hurley, chief executive of YouTube. EMI and YouTube have agreed to work together to develop ways in which EMI-owned recordings can be incorporated into user generated content by YouTube users. News of the deal comes just 10 days after EMI agreed to be taken over by private equity group Terra Firma for £2.4bn. Google bought the video-sharing website for $1.65bn (£883m) in October 2006.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/edinburgh_and_east/6707011.stm | Edinburgh and East | Witness appeal after hit-and-run GMT 14:31 appeal after hit-and-run Four-year-old Olivia Donachie was killed instantly in the crash. Police have urged witnesses to a hit-and-run in Edinburgh which killed four-year-old Olivia Donachie to contact them. Officers have been hunting for a man who fled the scene of the accident in the Colinton area of the city at about 1530 BST on Wednesday. Olivia's mother Rachel, 33, is stable but critically ill in hospital. A man who was detained by members of the public at the scene of the accident has been released by police. Eyewitnesses said a green Cherokee Jeep had been involved in two collisions with other vehicles shortly before the fatal accident. The earlier crashes occurred in the area within a 15-minute period. When I got close up to the vehicle I could see that it was a most horrendous accident Officers said the first crash happened in Lanark Road at the Gillespie Crossroads and the second one in Bridge Road in nearby Colinton Village. No-one was injured in the Gillespie Crossroads incident but two women suffered minor injuries as a result of the collision in Bridge Road. An incident room has been established at Gayfield Square Police Station. Chief Inspector Paul Bullen, of Lothian and Borders Police, appealed for information, especially from bus passengers. He said: "We know that when the fatal crash happened there were two Lothian Transport buses, numbers 10 and 16 nearby and we would like to hear from anyone on them who may have seen what happened or have any information about the incident. "When the collision happened at Gillespie Crossroads there was a number 45 bus nearby and those passengers should come forward. "We would also like to hear from anyone who may have seen the fatal crash yesterday afternoon or saw a green Cherokee jeep driving erratically and has any information about what happened." The woman and her daughter were struck near a wall only yards from their home in Westgarth Avenue. One of those first to arrive after the accident was resident Gordon Reynolds, who described the scene as shocking. He said: "When I got close up to the vehicle I could see that it was a most horrendous accident. "There was what I took to be the body of a very young child pinned, massively hemmed in at the front of the vehicle." Scenes of crime, CID and forensic officers have been examining the vehicle and the crash site. She was a wonderful, innocent, four-year-old girl who loved everything that she did at nursery Bonaly Primary School head teacher Gordon Robertson, the head teacher of Bonaly Primary School, where Olivia attended nursery, said her death had left everyone at the school devastated. "She was a wonderful, innocent, four-year-old girl who loved everything that she did at nursery," he said. "She was so full of joy and so popular with her classmates and the staff. "Our thoughts are with the whole Donachie family and we are praying for Olivia's mum Rachel, who is still in hospital." Rev George Whyte, the minister of Colinton, said the community was in shock over what has happened. "This is a quiet family community where people walk around and know each other," he said.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6708553.stm BBC SPORT | Football | Internationals | Worthington set to be NI manager GMT 14:58 set to be NI manager Nigel Worthington played 66 times for Northern Ireland Nigel Worthington will be unveiled as the new Northern Ireland manager on Friday, BBC Sport understands. The 66-times capped former defender is the Irish Football Association's choice to succeed Lawrie Sanchez who resigned to take charge of Fulham last month. The 45-year-old has previously managed Blackpool and Norwich City and has just completed a spell in temporary charge of Championship side Leicester City. It is unclear if the appointment goes beyond the Euro 2008 qualifying series. Worthington's first game in charge will be against Liechtenstein at Windsor Park in August. Northern Ireland are in with a chance of qualifying for a major championship for the first time in over 20 years. Is Worthington the right choice for Northern Ireland? They head Group F on 13 points following the superb victory against Sweden in March. The IFA Executive is expected to be asked to ratify the appointment on Friday morning ahead of a media conference and a backroom team will then be announced. Worthington began his career as a left-back with Ballymena United in the Irish League in 1979 and went on to play at full-time professional level for Notts County, Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds United, Stoke City and Blackpool. He spent ten years at Sheffield Wednesday and was a member of the Owls side that won the League Cup and promotion to the top flight in 1990-91. Two years later, Worthington and his teammates were losing finalists in both the League Cup and FA Cup. The highlights of his international career included being part of the 1986 World Cup squad in Mexico and a spell as captain under manager Bryan Hamilton.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6708141.stm | Increase in anti-terror targets GMT 14:12 in anti-terror targets BBC News home affairs Counter-terror police are stopping and searching more people Counter-terror police have recorded a 37% increase in "suspicious reconnaissance" of potential targets in the first four months of 2007. Metropolitan Police commanders said the "undiminished" threat level justified the continued use of random stop-and-search powers. But they accepted the reasons for almost 23,000 stops under anti-terror laws in London needed more explaining. Campaigners say anti-terrorism stop and searches "criminalise" communities. However, the Home Office may expand the powers yet further. ANTI-TERRORISM STOPS AND SEARCHES 22,672 from Sept 05 to Oct 06 16% of stops Asian In February London police came under fire from their watchdog, the Metropolitan Police Authority, in a major report into the effect of counter-terrorism policing on the capital. The watchdog found that the force's use of special anti-terror stop and search powers were doing "untold harm" to communities in the capital, in particularly Muslims. Under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000, police officers may randomly stop someone without reasonable suspicion, providing the area has been designated a likely target for an attack. The power is currently in force across the whole of London. Under Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000 police officers may randomly stop someone without reasonable suspicion, providing the area has been designated a likely target for an attack. The power is currently in force across the whole of London. But coming under fire for the use of the power, senior officers told the watchdog that the threat to the UK from terrorism remained "undiminished" - and that police had to use as broad a range of tools as possible. Commander John McDowell, the Met's deputy national co-ordinator for counter-terrorism in the UK, said he agreed with analysis that the threat had worsened. "There have been public pronouncements that the threat has grown in volume and I would concur with that," he said. "Since 2005 we have seen an increase in activity and an increase in the gradient of the graph." Commander McDowell said that the first four months of 2007 had seen the police record a 37% increase in what it classed as suspicious reconnaissance - incidents that may be the first stage in planning an attack on the public. He cautioned that this increase in reporting may be partly attributable to improved intelligence gathering as the security services expand counter-terrorism operations. Assistant Commissioner Andy Hayman of the Met Police said the figure showed why officers were right to continue to use the Section 44 powers. WHERE SEC 44 STOPS HAPPEN 23% Outside Govt buildings, iconic sites, tourist attractions While police could never be certain that a stop directly reduced the threat of a specific potential attack, he said it was important in a wider counter-terrorism context. "What we do know is the mode of behaviour around a terrorist," he said. "If they feel that they could be stopped and searched under these powers, they could be prevented [from attacking]. What I don't know is how many are truly prevented." Assistant Commissioner Hayman said that he accepted some of the criticisms of how the powers had been deployed - in particularly the lack of public information on who was being stopped. He said the force would introduce a new rule book for officers involved in Section 44 stops - and the Met would also build a publicity campaign to explain to key communities why police believed the power was necessary. Some officers were "unsure" of how the powers should be used, according to the Met's report into their use. The defence of the powers came days after the Home Office said it was considering introducing a wider "stop and question" law. The new power would give police an automatic right to stop and question anyone in the UK about suspected terrorism, building on the Section 44 power currently in force. The proposal immediately drew fire from civil liberties groups and Muslim campaigners who predicted it would criminalise entire communities. features and more from the BBC website for London More stop and quiz terror powers 27 in anti-terror targets Stop-smoking drug approved on NHS
http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/6707995.stm BBC SPORT | Football | My Club | Man Utd | Man Utd seal deal for Hargreaves GMT 12:16 Utd seal deal for Hargreaves Manchester United have targeted Hargreaves for a year Manchester United have confirmed that England midfielder Owen Hargreaves will join them from Bayern Munich on 1 July. United have not yet disclosed the fee for the 26-year-old but it is believed to be in the region of £17m. Hargreaves has agreed personal terms and passed a medical so now he only has to officially put pen to paper on what is expected to be a five-year deal. "Owen will formally sign his contract when he returns from a holiday at the end of June," read a United statement. Where would Hargreaves fit into your United XI? Hargreaves, who is taking a family break in his native Canada, has been a long-time target for United. The Premiership champions failed with bids to sign him last summer and in January. He enjoyed an illustrious 10 seasons at Bayern, winning six league titles and the 2001 Champions League. Now we're ready to attack on four fronts But his final season was plagued by injury and ended with Bayern finishing fourth in the Bundesliga, thereby missing out on Champions League qualification. Hargreaves had a four-month lay-off at the start of the campaign because of a broken leg and went on to play in only nine league games. He will also miss England's matches against Brazil and Estonia in June because of a knee problem. The announcement of Hargreaves' arrival at Old Trafford comes less than 24 hours after it was revealed that United had agreed "in principle" to sign Brazilian midfielder Anderson, 19, from FC Porto and Portuguese winger Nani, 20, from Sporting Lisbon.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6708375.stm | GMT 14:32 maps from Google could be available offline Google has launched a tool designed to make it easier for computer users to use online applications offline. One of the key limitations of web services such as e-mail, word processing and calendars, is that they require a net connection to function. Gears allows access to online data and applications inside the web browser when offline. The tool was launched at Google's global developer day, with 5,000 coders attending seminars worldwide. Google Gears is an open source plug-in for browsers, which the firm hopes will lead to the creation of new web standards. The firm wants many of the people attending its developers conference to use the Gears tools, which are free to use, to adapt their own applications for offline usage. Using Gears, online data that is usually held on web servers can be stored offline on an individual's computer, and then synchronised when the user logs back on to the web. Chris Prince, the engineer leading the Gears project, told the conference in London: "We want a seamless experience between offline and online." "This fills a gap for us," said Jeff Huber, a vice president of engineering at Google. "The internet is great, but you can't always be plugged in to it." Initially, Google's RSS feed reader application - for reading news and blogs - will work offline, but the company plans to add other programmes, Mr Huber said. A word processor with less functionality than WordPad isn't going to upset anyone's business model, online or off Michael Gartenberg, Jupiter Research He said Google's e-mail, calendar, word processing and spreadsheet programmes were logical candidates for offline access. Gears works in most of the leading web browsers, such as Firefox and Internet Explorer, and will soon work with Safari and Opera. "With Google Gears we're tackling a key limitation of the browser in order to make it a stronger platform for deploying all types of applications and enabling a better user experience in the cloud," Google chairman Eric Schmidt said in a statement. He added: "We believe strongly in the power of the community to stretch this new technology to the limits of what's possible and ultimately emerge with an open standard that benefits everyone." Brendan Eich, chief technology officer at Mozilla corporation, the organisation behind the Firefox browser, said: "This announcement is a significant step forward for web applications." Some commentators have seen the move as a strike at Microsoft's dominance in the area of productivity applications. But Jupiter Research analyst Michael Gartenberg struck a more cautious note about the new technology. Writing in his blog, he said: "Folks are missing the point. "Yes, offline functionality is required but it isn't in itself a game changer. A word processor with less functionality than WordPad isn't going to upset anyone's business model, online or off." Google also used the conference to announce Google Mapplets, a tool giving developers the power to customise Google maps with mini-applications. News stories, weather, housing prices, and crime figures could be combined with maps to provide a more geographical representation of data. Speaking at the London-based conference, Ed Parsons, Google's geospatial technologist, said the firm wanted developers to help build a "geo-web".

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6707935.stm | Coulson to be Tories' press chief GMT 15:58 to be Tories' press chief Andy Coulson joins the Tories at a crucial time Former News of the World editor Andy Coulson is to become the Conservative Party's Director of Communications. Mr Coulson quit his job with the tabloid after one of his reporters was jailed for plotting to intercept phone messages left for royal aides. The new job with the Tories will be a key one as David Cameron prepares to take on incoming PM Gordon Brown. Meanwhile it emerged that Mr Brown's long time aide, Michael Ellam, will be his official spokesman in Number 10. Mr Ellam, who worked for Ken Clarke before spending the last ten years working for Mr Brown at the Treasury, will handle the daily lobby briefings when Mr Brown succeeds Mr Blair. As well as editing the News of the World, Mr Coulson, 39, is also well known for his past stint as editor of The Sun's Bizarre pop gossip column. Mr Cameron said: "Andy is a hugely experienced journalist. I am delighted that he has agreed to join my team. "Andy will make a formidable contribution as a senior member of my team in building the most effective strategy and operation to win the next general election. I look forward very much to working with him". A Tory spokesman said Mr Coulson would give the Conservative press operation the extra "horsepower" it needed in the run up to the next general election. "A lot of Andy's job will involve being in day-to-day contact with editors and senior commentators and dealing with long-term strategy," he added. "We are not looking for an Alastair Campbell figure - his reliance on spin and aggressive media management has been discredited. Ellam to be No 10 spokesman "But we are looking for more horsepower and we are delighted that Andy will be playing a key role in David Cameron's top team." He said George Eustice would continue to be Mr Cameron's personal press secretary. He denied Mr Coulson's job would involve building bridges with the Tory-supporting newspapers and columnists who have launched scathing attacks on Mr Cameron's education policy in recent weeks. "This has nothing to do with the controversy over grammar schools," he said. Mr Coulson, 39, quit as News of the World editor in January on the day Clive Goodman, the paper's former royal editor, was jailed for four months for illegal phone tapping. A Tory spokesman said the party was satisfied Mr Coulson was not to blame for the scandal after he was cleared by a Press Complaints Commission investigation. The PCC found no evidence that Mr Coulson or anyone else at the paper was aware of Goodman's illegal activities. A close friend of former Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan, Mr Coulson started out as a reporter on the Basildon Evening Echo. He rose rapidly through the News International ranks, editing The Sun newspaper's Bizarre gossip column and, in 2003, succeeding Rebekah Wade as editor of the News of the World. His reign saw a string of old-fashioned tabloid exclusives, lifting the lid on the private lives of David Beckham, David Blunkett, Sven Goran Eriksson. Commenting on his latest role, Mr Coulson said: "I am delighted to be joining David Cameron's team and I look forward to helping the Conservative Party to return to Government under his leadership." jailed over royal phone taps 26 Jan 07 | UK Blair issues Africa action call Coulson to be Tories' press chief Increase in anti-terror targets
http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/6706947.stm | South Asia | Nepal parties agree November poll GMT 16:29 parties agree November poll The Maoists want the king to go before the vote is held Elections to a constituent assembly to shape Nepal's future will take place in November, the ruling coalition says. The seven parties and former Maoists had earlier agreed to hold the vote in June, but the election commission said it needed more time to organise it. The assembly will decide the future of the monarchy and political system. The date of the vote has yet to be fixed. The elections are part of a peace deal signed last year with the Maoists whose 10-year rebellion claimed 13,000 lives. "We have agreed to hold the constituent assembly elections by the end of November and the eight party leaders have given the responsibility to the government to fix the date," Ramchandra Poudel, Nepal's minister for peace and reconstruction, told the AFP news agency. The weapons of both sides are under UN supervision He said the country's parliament, formed in January, would need to amend the interim constitution in the next two weeks. "We have also agreed to amend the interim constitution and formulate the necessary election laws by mid-June," he said. United Left Front party leader CP Mainali said that Prime Minister GP Koirala had proposed 26 November as election day, but that the date had not been approved by the leaders of the other parties. The governing coalition of seven political parties and the former Maoist rebels has said the fate of Nepal's beleaguered monarch, King Gyanendra, will be decided in the new assembly's first meeting. He was forced to relinquish most of his powers after huge protests in April last year ended his absolute rule. The assembly's members are then supposed to reorder Nepal's highly centralised political structure. The BBC's Mark Dummett in Kathmandu says they will consider a federal form of government, as well as ways to empower traditionally marginalised groups, such as low-caste Hindus, indigenous tribes and people living on the southern plains. The delay in holding the elections prompted complaints by the Maoists that King Gyanendra was manipulating the situation and trying to make a comeback. The former rebels insist he should be removed and a republic declared before polls are held. At least 13,000 people were killed in the fighting between security forces and Maoists, after the rebels began their insurgency in 1996. As part of a landmark peace deal agreed late last year, the former rebels and the army have placed their weapons under United Nations supervision.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6708311.stm | Morgan reveals assembly cabinet News in video and audio GMT 15:20 reveals assembly cabinet Rhodri Morgan has been drawing up the new team for the past week Welsh First Minister Rhodri Morgan has announced major changes to his new Labour cabinet team. Ex-social justice minister Edwina Hart takes health from Brian Gibbons and Carwyn Jones becomes the new education, culture and Welsh language minister. Dr Gibbons is now economy and transport minister and former education minister Jane Davidson takes charge of "sustainability and rural development". Opposition members warned the minority administration could soon be ousted. Under the assembly's new powers, Mr Morgan nominated his cabinet team and its members were appointed by the Queen. Cabinet changes became inevitable after the 3 May assembly election. Previous culture minister Alun Pugh lost his Clwyd West seat to the Conservatives and finance minister Sue Essex stood down in Cardiff North, a seat also captured by the Tories. Mr Morgan was re-appointed first minister last Friday after the coalition agreement between the three other parties appeared to have collapsed when it was rejected by senior Liberal Democrats. But the following day, Lib Dems voted to go ahead with the alliance at a special conference. Plaid Cymru's national council will meet in July to decide on a possible agreement with the Lib Dems and Conservatives. Labour is ruling as a minority administration after winning 26 of the 60 seats in the assembly election. Plaid has 15 AMs, the Tories 12, Lib Dems six, and there is one independent. If the opposition parties unite, they can oust Mr Morgan with a vote of no confidence. Mr Morgan is expected to announce his team of deputy ministers later.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6707475.stm | Asia-Pacific | Thai security chiefs fear unrest GMT 12:06 security chiefs fear unrest Support for Thai Rak Thai remains high in parts of Thailand Security officials have met in the Thai capital to discuss how to deal with possible unrest after a court ruling banning the former governing party. Supporters of Thai Rak Thai have threatened protests over the verdict, which also saw key party leaders barred from politics for five years. Army chiefs said extra security had been introduced on top of measures put in place ahead of Wednesday's ruling. The interim PM said he would impose a state of emergency if there was unrest. In a day of drama, a constitutional tribunal ruled on Wednesday that Thai Rak Thai was guilty of breaking electoral laws last year. It's an unexpected ruling and we are disappointed by the verdict - it's too harsh on Thai Rak Thai Earlier, it cleared the country's other main political party, the Democrats, of similar charges. Thai Rak Thai leaders have condemned the outcome as unfair but urged people to accept it. The party's founder, Thaksin Shinawatra - who was prime minister until he was ousted in a coup last September - urged "everyone to stay calm and don't make any moves". Bangkok was reported to be relatively calm on Thursday, although there was a small protest against last year's coup. Thousands of soldiers have been deployed in Bangkok Thousands of soldiers were put on alert earlier in the week in case of unrest, and army chief Sonthi Boonyaratglin said further checkpoints and security measures were now in place. A few "hardcore" allies of Mr Thaksin were being specifically monitored, he told the AFP news agency. "Security measures have been stepped up since last night and will gradually be increased," he said. "The measures will be in place for a long time". The panel of judges announced their verdict on Thai Rak Thai in a heavily-guarded courtroom in Bangkok on Wednesday, after hours of suspense. Thai courts are known to lack independence. It is sad that the great achievements of Thaksin are overlooked Send us your comments They found the party guilty of malpractice during the April 2006 electional campaign, and ruled that it should be disbanded and more than 100 party officials, including Mr Thaksin, be barred from office. Earlier, the same judges ruled that the Democrats - Thailand's oldest political party - had not maligned Thai Rak Thai in the same elections and would not have to disband. Following the malpractice allegations, the April 2006 elections were annulled. Prime Minister Thaksin was ousted by a military coup a few months later. The BBC's Andrew Harding in Bangkok says the decision to punish the entire party is sure to provoke anger in Thailand. Thai Rak Thai still retains widespread popularity, especially in rural areas, and supporters of the charismatic Mr Thaksin are likely to be upset that he has been barred from politics for so long. king warns over court ruling 25 Thai government hires PR company 30 Apr 07 | Asia-Pacific Draft of Thai constitution agreed 18 Apr 07 | Asia-Pacific Thai king remains centre stage 21 Sep 06 | Asia-Pacific 02 Oct 06 | Country profiles security chiefs fear unrest State of emergency ends in Fiji Freed Chinese panda dies in wild

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6708511.stm | Tories deny grammars 'disarray' GMT 15:40 deny grammars 'disarray' Mr Grieve said new grammars should be built if needed The Tories have denied their education policy is in "disarray" after a second frontbencher defended grammar schools. Dominic Grieve told his local paper that if more grammars were needed in Buckinghamshire, they should be built. One shadow minister has already quit after leader David Cameron said it was "delusional" to expect new grammars. But the party denied Labour claims its policy was in "chaos" saying Mr Cameron had only been referring to areas that did not already have grammar schools. In an article for the Buckinghamshire Examiner, Mr Grieve - shadow attorney general and MP for Beaconsfield - said he was "pleased" the Conservatives were looking at ways of reforming the comprehensive school system nationally. But he added: "There is no question of our changing the selective education system in Buckinghamshire against the wishes of the local community. "We must also ensure that if further grammar or secondary schools are needed they can be supplied within the county." David has said absolutely nothing that is out of line with Conservative Party policy There are 164 grammar schools in England - choosing pupils by academic ability at the age of 11 - with 10 local education authorities considered to be fully selective. David Cameron has faced a grassroots rebellion over his decision to ditch the Tories' traditional support for grammar schools and academic selection. He said the party had not built a single new grammar school during its 18 years in power, that evidence suggested they did not enhance social mobility and called it "delusional" to think they would be able to build more in the future. Instead, he pledged support for existing grammar schools, but backed an expansion of Labour's academies programme instead. On Tuesday Europe spokesman Graham Brady resigned after being reprimanded and warned to stick to his brief after saying selective schools could boost overall educational standards. The policy was also denounced by members of the Conservatives' influential 1922 committee of backbench MPs as "ridiculous" and "absurd". Europe Minister Mr Brady has already quit over the row On Thursday, Labour's chief whip Jacqui Smith said: "Dominic Grieve's comments have thrown the Tories' schools policy into further chaos. "At the same time as David Cameron and George Osborne pledge that new grammar schools would not be built, their own shadow attorney general says that allowance should be made for new grammar schools to be built. "The Tories are in complete disarray." But the Conservatives say Mr Grieve's comments do not contradict party policy. Shadow Education Secretary David Willetts said: "David has said absolutely nothing that is out of line with Conservative Party policy. "I do understand that in parts of the country where they've got grammar schools, as demography changes, so they will come forward with how their grammar school system needs to change." Mr Willetts said Mr Grieve's argument had been made in the full knowledge of his discussions with Buckinghamshire MPs and councillors - and he did not rule out building more grammar schools in such areas if they were needed. "I am fully aware that in a place with rapid demographic change, like Buckinghamshire, you are inevitably going to face questions about whether you need to build more schools or not," he added. quits post over grammars row 29 Tory reprimanded over grammars 29 Q&A: What are grammar schools? 16 Cameron steps up grammars attack 22 Is Cameron winning schools fight? 22 Cameron attacks grammar 'fantasy' 21 No more grammars, Tories pledge 09 Jan 06 | Education issues Africa action call Coulson to be Tories' press chief Increase in anti-terror targets

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6707157.stm | Mortgage approvals hit year low GMT 12:16 approvals hit year low Recent interest rate rises in the UK could be beginning to bite The number of new mortgage approvals in the UK fell to a 12-month low in April, Bank of England figures show. Mortgage approvals totalled 107,000 in April, down from 111,000 in March and the third monthly decline in a row. In a further indication of weakening buyer demand mortgage lending rose by £8.9bn, much less than expected and the weakest rise since September Consumer debt rose by only £498m - half what was expected and the smallest increase since March 1997. "The Bank of England will be comforted by today's news which shows its monetary tightening is taking effect," said Thushani Gajasinghe, an economist at the Centre for Economic and Business Research. "With a further quarter-point rate increase possible in the third quarter, consumer lending may cool further." Historically low interest rates in the past few years have encouraged Britons to take on a mountain of debt - now reaching £1.5 trillion. However, interest rates have risen four times since the beginning of August last year which has begun to put pressure on some households' finances. Interest rates rose to 5.5% last month and it is widely thought a further rate increase is on the cards before August, and could even hit 6% by the end of the year. These rate rises are already impacting the consumer's attitude to credit card spending, and are expected to eventually take some of the steam out of the surging housing market and stabilise soaring property prices. But with double-digit price growth reported by Nationwide for May, analysts remain tentative on calling when a slowdown may occur. Global Insight economist Howard Archer said a general property shortage - particularly in London and the South East - would keep pricing power in favour of the vendor for a little while yet. But he did point out that significantly more houses have come onto the market in recent weeks as vendors looked to beat the planned introduction of compulsory Home Information Packs (Hips) in June. "This could well have some dampening impact on house prices in the near term at least, although it remains to be seen how housing supply will be affected by the delaying of the introduction of Hips to at least August," he added. home costs deter buyers Spain real estate sell-off eases House price growth 'strengthens' Cheapest homes top £100k Mortgage lending is still booming Will house prices crash?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6708995.stm | Americas | US urges new greenhouse gas goals GMT 16:51 urges new greenhouse gas goals Germany wants a 50% cut in emissions by 2050 US President George W Bush has urged countries to agree on long-term goals for greenhouse gas emissions. He said he would hold meetings bringing together the US and 14 other major emitters, including developing nations, to set targets by the end of 2008. Mr Bush was outlining US policy ahead of next week's G8 summit, in which the German hosts are expected to call for cuts in emissions. The US has been accused of resisting strong action to tackle climate change. It has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, which sets out targets on lowering emissions until 2012. But Mr Bush on Thursday insisted that his administration took climate change seriously. The way to meet the challenge of energy and global climate change is through technology "The United States will work with other nations to establish a new framework on greenhouse gas emissions for when the Kyoto protocol expires," he said. To achieve this goal, he added, the US would hold a series of meetings bringing together "nations that produced most greenhouse gas emissions, including nations with rapidly growing economies like India and China". The BBC's Adam Brookes, in Washington, says Mr Bush's proposals differ radically from plans put forward by European countries ahead of the G8 summit. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called for a major deal, including slowing the rise in average temperatures to 2C this century, by way of a cut in global emissions by 50% below 1990 levels by 2050. The United States has rejected that approach. In his address in Washington, Mr Bush repeated that solutions to the problem of global warming would be found through the development of new technologies. "The United States is in the lead," he said. "The world is on the verge of great breakthroughs that will help us become better stewards of the environment." The US president also urged other nations to eliminate tariffs on clean energy technologies. The G8 summit will be held on 6-8 June in Heiligendamm in Germany.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/education/6704563.stm | School power to search for knives GMT 05:36 power to search for knives The government hopes to stamp out the use of violent weapons Schools in England have been given the legal right to search pupils who are suspected of carrying knives. Head teachers will also be given guidance on how to use airport-style metal detectors to screen young people. The guidelines state that a pupil can be refused entry to a school if he or she refuses to be screened. Education Secretary Alan Johnson said knife-carrying in schools was rare, but it was illegal and a message it would not be tolerated must be sent out. I think parents will welcome the clear message that bringing a weapon into school is a criminal offence Education Secretary Alan Johnson 'Why my school uses search wands' He told the BBC: "What happens at the moment is that if a teacher suspects a child of carrying a knife they have to call the police and wait for the police to arrive before that child can be searched - unless the child agrees to be searched. "By that time any weapon they are carrying may have been passed on." Under the new guidelines trained staff, authorised by the head teacher, would be able to carry out searches. Crucially, a search should never take place where there is any risk to staff or pupils. They also explain how best to screen pupils, suggesting that randomly selected groups of pupils could be searched in order to send out a strong message of deterrence. But it also sets out limits for schools, in that suspicion has to be reasonable and not based on stereotypical images of certain groups of pupils. Two members of staff should be present for a search and both must be the same sex as the pupil. And students can only be required to remove outer clothing, such as coats or jackets. Mr Johnson said teachers themselves had asked for the powers but added that the main way to keep knives out of our schools is to continue educating young people about the dangers associated with them. "I think parents will welcome the clear message that bringing a weapon into school is a criminal offence and will not be tolerated." Parents should make sure their children do not leave for school with weapons Send us your comments But he added: "Let's not exaggerate how our schools look at the moment our schools have a very low proportion with any problem at all with pupils bringing in weapons. "The Youth Justice Board survey told us that, Ofsted told us that and head teachers and teachers tell her that. "Lets not exaggerate this into saying our schools are some kind of ghetto from central Manhattan or the Bronx." National Association of Head Teachers spokesman said it was the job of the police to search individuals for weapons. "They are trained and have the appropriate body armour. "Our advice to our members will be to call for police assistance should they suspect that a weapon is being carried." General secretary of the NASUWT union, Chris Keates, welcomed the new powers, but said searches must be conducted properly by appropriately trained staff. "However, all schools will still need to consider how they will be incorporated into their policies and procedures to ensure that they are prepared fully should the need arise. "There is a clear role for local authorities and the local police in supporting and advising schools in this process." The Teacher Support Network said in the past year its support line had handled 175 calls regarding behaviour management, 30% of which were concerned specifically with violence, abuse and threats. "Giving teachers facing these issues the power to stop and search pupils may make them feel safer at work though schools must exercise extreme caution," a spokesman added.
