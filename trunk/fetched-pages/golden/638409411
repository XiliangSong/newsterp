Conrad/The come and go in the homes of the painter Hunt Slonem, both the quick and the dead. There’s the handyman, who’s brought a stray cat that’s been screaming its head off all morning; the antique picker who has spread his wares outside; the friends who have stopped by to visit Mr. Slonem in his latest acquisition, an 1832 plantation house called Lakeside, pink if you please, as surprising in this community of shoebox houses as an aged diva in a pink organdy dress at McDonald’s. Also as indifferent, inasmuch as a house can be indifferent, to the bruising of time. The long dining room table is set with pink porcelain plates, a few of which have been over-set with paper plates. Lunch is Louisiana takeout: boudin sausage, pecan pie, a local desert called ooey gooey. The talk is of a portrait, just hung, of Catherine of Aragon. Then Mr. Slonem’s caretaker calls with word of an interloper: a voodoo head, or something that looks like one, has been found in the third-floor ceiling earlier in the week and tucked away in a kitchen cabinet. Mr. Slonem goes at once to retrieve the head, a mud-colored walnut-size carving of a skull, with a tiny straw hat and pointy appendages. Then he retreats to make a call. When he returns to the table, Mr. Slonem is relieved: the psychic did say her stomach hurt when he first mentioned the head, he says. But she believes whatever powers it once had to be long gone. There are those who scoff at mysticism. Mr. Slonem, a 55-year-old New York painter whose work, both artistic and domestic, is the subject of a forthcoming book, “Pleasure Palace: The Art and Homes of Hunt Slonem,” to be published by powerHouse Books, and whose paintings are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , does not. The spirit world figures in his life, his art, his five homes. He refers to psychics the way successful businessmen refer to their lawyers. “Tell her the wire transfers haven’t come through,” he tells a caller. “My psychic says by the end of the week.” Speaking with Mr. Slonem, it is easy to become confused, for in referring to this person or that he does not distinguish between the living and the dead. (“The countess predicted I would buy another plantation,” he says, the countess being one Xacha Obrenevitch, a spiritualist of the 1920s who, as Mr. Slonem understands it, was an intimate of Rudolph Valentino. Mr. Slonem has also heard from Valentino, who once came to him when he was meditating and demanded to be painted dancing the tango. The series sold rather well, Mr. Slonem says.) THE notion that less is more has never appealed to Mr. Slonem. In New York City he rents 30,000 square feet — about 80 rooms — of former office space in the West Village, which houses 35 birds, tropical plants and wildly colored areas. The yearly rent is about $300,000, a spectacular deal in New York. He also owns the Cordt mansion, a 19th-century home in Kingston, N.Y., which he bought in 2001 for $770,000, and the Albania plantation house in Jeanerette, La., a property so grand that it was used as a setting for the 2006 remake of “All the King’s Men,” inspired by Gov. Huey Long of Louisiana. (The mansion’s appearance in the film was a good thing, Mr. Slonem says, because the money he was paid helped offset the cost of termite damage.) His newest home, here in rural Louisiana, is a faded, dream-inspiring pile with 18-foot ceilings, circular staircases and a filigree wrought-iron entrance. Inside, where there was significant deterioration, some walls have been repaired and painted. The red room, on the ground floor, is really red, with red walls and a half dozen red velvet sofas. But for the most part the old plaster walls, here yellowed and peeling, there the color of neglected pearls, have been left to be what they are. Mr. Slonem’s antiques, some from expensive shops, some from flea markets, seem to have always been here. When he takes a pair of 19th-century girandoles to the third-floor sitting room and places them on the mantel, one feels as if the house is reaching out to embrace them. Mr. Slonem bought the house, originally listed at $1.2 million, for about $625,000 in 2005. He has now spent, by his calculation, a few hundred thousand in renovation: completely rewiring the house, replacing rotted floorboards, refurbishing plumbing and the pool. Not included in those figures are the furnishings. There is also Mr. Slonem’s own brightly colored art; hothouse flowers and birds, saints and of course Valentino share space with portraits of Louisiana landowners long dead. And Mr. Slonem is not finished: paintings and furnishings are still arriving.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31garden.html Reshaping Their Own Worldview Their Own Worldview Darke and Melinda Zoehrer used native and nonnative plants like Allegheny pachysandra and Asian Syneilesis aconitifolia, creating a welcoming retreat. Darke and Melinda Zoehrer. Rick Darke bought this one-and-a-half-acre property about 20 years ago, it was nothing to write home about: a modest ranch on a lawn set a bit close to the road, with the usual crabapples and yews. But to the east was a spectacular view of fields rolling down to an old farmhouse and barn, bordered by a forest full of oak and beech, with a meandering creek. Mr. Darke, then curator of plants at Longwood Gardens, in Kennett Square, Pa., soon met his future wife, Melinda Zoehrer, who was then the development director of the Delaware Center for Horticulture, in Wilmington. The two threw themselves into gardening, planting unusual trees and shrubs and turning the lawn into a prairie by scattering seeds gathered from little bluestem, Indian grass and other natives growing along the roadsides. Now and then they sat down on the brow of the hill to drink in the scenery. “We were completely content to put two chairs there and say, ‘The whole thing is our garden,’ ” Mr. Darke said one afternoon about two weeks ago. “But we were always aware that it wouldn’t last forever.” Sure enough, oversize houses now dot the old hay meadow. The farmhouse and barn are up for sale. To screen out the houses, Mr. Darke and Ms. Zoehrer have planted cedars and katsura trees, sweetshrub and shadbush, and turned their gaze inward, to the garden of their own making. They even had a little cabin built out of the hemlock and white pine that lived and died here; it faces the garden. It’s just big enough for sitting around a wood stove in winter or on the porch outside in the rain. They carved spaces at first with grasses like Karl Foerster, a feather reed grass planted in a semicircle to define an outdoor dining area. It formed a billowy curving wall until the seedlings of silverbell trees they planted in between grew tall enough to hold the space. They have planted many other trees, and moved some brought in by birds, like the alternate-leaved dogwood, Cornus alternifolia, that Mr. Darke found as a seedling beneath an old apple tree. He dug it up and replanted it by the front door of his house. Now the tree is 20 feet tall, 30 feet wide, its tiered horizontal branches covered with white flowers in spring, black fruits in summer, red leaves in fall. Beeches have blown in on the wind, their seeds floating up from the forest, and some seem to know just where to plant themselves. Others are moved, or given away. The bottlebrush buckeyes, brought as mere root divisions from Longwood, are now great green mounds of palm-shaped leaves; the winter hazels, started as cuttings from Longwood, fill the air with their perfume in February. Fragrant azaleas — both native and exotic hybrids — bloom beneath the huge whorled leaves of umbrella magnolias. And under the oak, Japanese lady-slippers have opened their crenellated leaves. “They’ve been here for 15 years with no water, no fertilizer,” Mr. Darke said, mentioning the two characteristics that are bound to win his heart. “We don’t have the kind of moisture and acid conditions to keep the native lady-slipper alive.” Mr. Darke has experienced a sea change in his own thinking as he has traveled widely; he now makes a living as a writer, photographer and consultant. He watches what succeeds and fails in this garden, the public spaces he works on: he has helped develop highway plantings for Delaware’s Department of Transportation, and he is in drought-stricken Australia now to share his knowledge of grasses with public horticulturists. Many grasses are tough and drought tolerant, like Dewey Blue, a coastal switchgrass that Mr. Darke first spotted years ago while searching for roadside plantings. Ms. Zoehrer, who is now the deputy director of the ’s Botanic Garden, has adopted Dewey Blue in her mixed border, where its arching blue-green blades complement the deeper blues and purples of baptisias, irises and salvias. Designing with grasses is the subject of Mr. Darke’s latest book, “The Encyclopedia of Grasses for Livable Landscapes,” published by Timber Press in April, but it has a far more global perspective than his earlier books, “The Color Encyclopedia of Ornamental Grasses” and “The American Woodland Garden,” which emphasized the use of native plants as a means of preserving regional landscapes. This new book opens its boundaries to welcome plants from other parts of the world if they can thrive without water, fertilizer and pesticides; if they are not invasive; and if they can harmonize with the surrounding landscape. “Ten years ago, I was unabashedly aligned with the native plant movement,” Mr. Darke said. “I’m still desperately interested in conserving local things, but sometimes the native plant movement is not nuanced enough.” It doesn’t leave room, in other words, for Japanese lady-slippers, even though they can thrive where natives can’t. It doesn’t acknowledge that many urban landscapes are too degraded for dogwoods and shadbush, and so many other natives that flourished before the concrete and asphalt. But prairie species like little bluestem and sheep’s fescue can flourish in parking lots and along old rail lines, even in Manhattan. In his new book, Mr. Darke concedes that a Japanese maple, like Acer trifolium, which turns bright orange in fall, can fit right in with native purple asters and the red-gold leaves of native sumac. In his own garden, Bowles Golden sedge, from northern Europe, nestles among white variegated Hakone grass, which hails from the Hakone mountains in Japan. Both plants need cool, wet habitats, like the north side of this Pennsylvania house. “A sensible palette takes a global ethic,” Mr. Darke said. “You never want to do anything potentially damaging to any habitat. But if we are going to keep spaces green around the world, we can’t restrict the garden to plants that existed before anybody touched it.”

What can I do? You need only look for your crop in the right place. Edible rhubarb parts are often called stalks, but they are actually leaf stems with the leaves, which are poisonous, removed. Inedible flowering stalks are the only true stalks a rhubarb plant makes. For the largest number of tasty stems plant rhubarb in a sunny spot, in fertile, well-drained soil. Hope for cold winters (rhubarb enjoys ground that freezes several inches down), along with cool summers and plentiful spring rain. Then wait: rhubarb takes several years to reach an ideal size. Once flower stalks rise, leaf stems start toughening. That is why rhubarb is best in spring. Removing flower stalks strengthens plants but will not keep the leaf stems from losing their succulence. Flower stalks normally form in late spring, but they can start earlier when plants are stressed by drought, lack of nutrients or crowding. So fertilizer can sometimes help, and plants older than 15 years should be divided. It might also pay to plant Valentine, a bright red variety known for being a late bloomer. It is less tart than old-fashioned rhubarb, which many consider a virtue. Sources include Hartmann’s Plant Company, or (269) 253-4281, and Miller Nurseries, I want to use climbing hydrangea to cover a 40-foot-wide slope that rises six feet. Could I train the plants to fall down the slope instead of climbing up, or is that too ambitious? The plan itself is fine. Although climbing hydrangea (Hydrangea petiolaris) is a slow grower, its gnarly stems, shiny leaves and lacy white flowers would make a beautiful ground cover. But it is the nature of vines to grow up; they fall only when there is nothing to climb, and this one can climb almost anything. Coercive training like tying stems in place will not work because every new branch will rise. You will be Sisyphus in reverse, constantly pushing the vines down the hill only to see them heading back up, over and over and over again. It is better to work with nature and plant the hydrangeas at the bottom of the slope. That will also help protect them from the droughts that appear increasingly likely.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31sofa.html If a Sofa Doesn&#8217;t Fit, They&#8217;ll Make It Fit a Sofa Doesn’t Fit, They’ll Make It Fit Robert Caplin for the Squeamish Workers from Dr. Sofa reassemble a couch in a Manhattan apartment. J. COURTNEY SULLIVAN GET calls at all hours of the night,” Shlomi Gal-On said recently, describing the vagaries of his work. “Usually there are tears involved.” S. Altman Snow makes a suburban house call. Mr. Gal-On, who is otherwise known as Dr. Sofa, has been in the couch disassembly business in New York for six years. In that time, the demand for his services and those of other disassemblers has increased sharply. But he still remembers each case, each a drama. “One woman called me crying because her couch didn’t fit through the front door of her building,” he said. “When I got to her place it was dark out and she was sitting on the sofa in the middle of the sidewalk, weeping hysterically. She jumped up and threw her arms around me and started shouting, ‘The messiah has come!’ We definitely got some interesting looks from people passing by.” Sofa disassembly has existed as a New York trade since the late 1970s. But in the last few years, major furniture sellers like Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s have begun offering sofas that are 94 inches or more in length and 43 inches or more in depth, compared with maximums of about 86 and 36 a decade ago. The number of desperate calls for help moving such large pieces has also grown, as has the number of businesses offering such help. “Long, overstuffed sofas are so popular right now, and they’re ideal if you have a McMansion,” said Michelle McKoy, a saleswoman at the Domain Home furnishings store on East 22nd Street in Manhattan. “But here in the city we are constantly running into the problem of people who buy them and then can’t get them into the elevator or through the door.” Ms. McKoy said the store’s sofas are 86 to 97 inches long and 36 to 41 inches deep, an increase of about five inches in length and depth from a decade ago. “Like most major furniture stores, we are nationwide, and our furniture really caters to large suburban homes,” she said. Suburban customers have driven the large couch invasion across the board, said Barton Bienenstock, the publisher of Furniture World, a trade magazine. “The furniture industry follows housing trends,” he said. As the size of American houses expanded in this decade, “furniture followed suit, and enormous sofas and high-back chairs have now become the norm.” Five or 10 years ago, he added, such large furniture was limited to the high end of the market, “but now even the moderately priced pieces are huge.” As a result, many one-man disassembly services have sprung up in the New York metropolitan area. The four most established furniture service companies — Dr. Sofa, based in the Bronx; Garry Furniture Service, in Queens; M.J.S. Furniture Service, in Massapequa, N.Y.; and Z Brothers, in Thornwood, N.Y. — all report a boom in business, even though none of them advertise. They charge $200 to $400 to get any couch into any space. “Customers love us because we make it possible for them to get the big couches they want,” said Michael Snow, the founder of M.J.S. He added that his company receives twice as many calls as it did 10 years ago and takes apart an average of six couches a day, six days a week. His competitors are busy, too. Garry Furniture takes apart up to six couches a day, a third more jobs than it was doing three years ago; Z Brothers has had a spike in calls in recent years and does 60 jobs a week on average; and Dr. Sofa gets nearly twice the number of calls it did three years ago and dismantles over 2,000 sofas a year. The disassembly process varies from one job to another, but typically a couch is flipped upside down and the fabric is gently peeled back. One arm is removed, then another. Sometimes the back must be taken off or more creative solutions found. Z Brothers recently removed the back and arms of a new 120-inch couch and it still didn’t fit in the elevator; workers carried the sofa up 10 flights of stairs in an adjoining building, then laid planks across the roof to move it in from above. The services have opened up decorating possibilities for those who would otherwise be forced to buy pieces based only on what could fit through the door: a tiny love seat, say, or a pair of armchairs.

Mr. Drake recommended painting small spaces “dark and dramatic, instead of light” because “dark color on the walls helps disintegrate the perimeters of the room. Plus, it’ll make your furniture pop.” “It’s a good idea to break up that color a little” by painting the ceiling a lighter color than the walls, he added. He suggested a combination of three Benjamin Moore colors: Crystal Blue on the ceiling, to offset walls painted Bittersweet Chocolate, with the molding painted a complimentary color, like Mayonnaise. If there is no molding, he said, “create the effect of one by making a stripe at the top of the wall” or about six inches above the ceiling line if the ceiling is low, to give the illusion of more height. Joe Nye, a Los Angeles-based interior designer known for his ebullient use of color, agreed. “I resist the notion that painting everything all white will make the room look larger,” he said. Besides, “color is the cheapest decorating trick I know.” “For something really gutsy and instant Park Avenue, a red room is always good. I’ve used Farrow & Ball’s Blazer No. 212 with great results,” Mr. Nye said. “A good green is Farrow & Ball Folly Green No. 76.” No matter how small your space, he said, make sure you paint all the walls, not just one, an approach he describes as “amateurish and straight out of one of those horrible decorating TV shows.” He also suggested stripes to make a low ceiling appear higher. Take the time to do it right, he said, by masking off guides using a plumb line and blue tape. Color can define areas within small spaces. Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan, a New York-based interior designer and co-founder of the Apartment Therapy blog ( ), suggested using two tones. “Put the bold color of your choice in your entry hallway or foyer,” he said, “and go for an off-white tone in the living area on the opposite end.” That makes the entrance area feel intimate, he said, while keeping the horizon point light, creating an expansive effect. Just don’t use stark white, he said. “Go for off-white instead, which is much warmer.” So how to begin? Benjamin Moore’s Web site ( ) has a Personal Color Viewer that displays various combinations of colors for walls, molding and ceilings in sample rooms. Other companies have Web sites with similar features: Farrow & Ball has a “color consultancy” feature that recommends two neutral colors to coordinate with any color you select ( ). And Behr has a program called ColorSmart that helps you sort through shades to find the right color ( If you would like to see how the colors would look in your home, Benjamin Moore sells a $14.95 CD called Personal Color Viewer 2.0. You can upload photographs of your rooms and try the colors on your walls. Or you can buy 2-ounce samples for $3.99, enough to cover a two-foot-square section of wall with two coats of paint.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31greywater.html Kripke Woelfle-Erskine has installed illegal the one at Haut House. Kripke ALLEN’S modest gray house in the Oakland flatlands would give a building inspector nightmares. Jerry-built pipes protrude at odd angles from the back and sides of the nearly century-old house, running into a cascading series of bathtubs filled with gravel and cattails. White PVC pipe, buckets, milk crates and hoses are strewn about the lot. Inside, there is mysterious — and illegal — plumbing in every room. Ms. Allen, 30, is one of the Greywater Guerrillas, a team focused on promoting and installing clandestine plumbing systems that recycle gray water — the effluent of sinks, showers and washing machines — to flush toilets or irrigate gardens. To her, this house is as much an emblem of her belief system as a home. Although gray water use is legal in California, systems that conform to the state’s complicated code tend to be very expensive, and Ms. Allen and her fellow guerrilla, Cleo Woelfle-Erskine, are out to persuade the world that water recycling can be a simple and affordable option, a morally essential one. They are part of a larger movement centered in the West — especially in arid regions like Arizona, New Mexico and Southern California — that includes both groups that operate within the law and ones that skirt it. The goal is the reuse of home gray water as a way to live within the region’s ecological means. Using their own experience and contributions from others, they have just published a do-it-yourself guide to is also a manifesto for the movement, “Dam Nation: Dispatches From the Water Underground.” “A lot of people that care about water try to conserve it,” said Ms. Allen, an elementary-school teacher who installed several buying this home — which she named the “Haut House,” for House of Appropriate Urban Technology — four years ago with a housemate. “But this is about changing the way you interact with it.” Mr. Woelfle-Erskine, a writer and teacher who lives on a houseboat with a gray water system in San Pablo, Calif., 10 miles north, added, “It’s about trying to use resources to their full potential and interact with ecosystems in a beneficial way.” In 1994, California became the first state to establish guidelines for gray water use — as most other states have since — and it has become a leader in building industrial-scale gray water systems. The town of Arcata, for example, has an extensive system that serves the entire population of 17,000, and even the state’s oil refineries have gray water systems. But many gray water advocates say that California’s plumbing code — which stipulates things like pipe sizes, burial depths and soil tests based on rules established for septic systems — is prohibitively complicated for private homeowners interested in recycling gray water, and that its requirements are prohibitively expensive. “The code is so overbuilt that I’m beginning to think it’s better to just have everyone do it bootleg,” said Steve Bilson, the founder of ReWater Systems, a company that has installed around 800 code-compliant a cost of about $7,000 each, and who worked as a consultant on California gray water legislation in the 1990s. As a result, many homeowners have installed unpermitted, illegal plumbing, relying on techniques developed by covert researchers like the Greywater Guerrillas. (It is difficult to know how many, since these systems are not registered with any government or organization, but Ms. Allen said that based on her observations there are probably around 2,000 homes equipped with gray water systems, a few legal but most illegal, in the Bay Area alone.) On a recent afternoon, Mr. Woelfle-Erskine stood in the backyard of the Haut House and explained how one of the half-dozen works. A pipe running from the house deposits shower and sink water into an elevated bathtub in the yard that is filled with gravel and reeds, and the roots of plants begin filtering and absorbing contaminants. The water then flows into a second, lower, tub, also containing a reedbed, before flowing into a still-lower tub of floating water hyacinths and small fish.

Mr. Slonem goes at once to retrieve the head, a mud-colored walnut-size carving of a skull, with a tiny straw hat and pointy appendages. Then he retreats to make a call.

Huey Long of Louisiana. (The mansion’s appearance in the film was a good thing, Mr. Slonem says, because the money he was paid helped offset the cost of termite damage.) His newest home, here in rural Louisiana, is a faded, dream-inspiring pile with 18-foot ceilings, circular staircases and a filigree wrought-iron entrance. Inside, where there was significant deterioration, some walls have been repaired and painted. The red room, on the ground floor, is really red, with red walls and a half dozen red velvet sofas. But for the most part the old plaster walls, here yellowed and peeling, there the color of neglected pearls, have been left to be what they are. Mr. Slonem’s antiques, some from expensive shops, some from flea markets, seem to have always been here. When he takes a pair of 19th-century girandoles to the third-floor sitting room and places them on the mantel, one feels as if the house is reaching out to embrace them. Mr. Slonem bought the house, originally listed at $1.2 million, for about $625,000 in 2005. He has now spent, by his calculation, a few hundred thousand in renovation: completely rewiring the house, replacing rotted floorboards, refurbishing plumbing and the pool. Not included in those figures are the furnishings. There is also Mr. Slonem’s own brightly colored art; hothouse flowers and birds, saints and of course Valentino share space with portraits of Louisiana landowners long dead. And Mr. Slonem is not finished: paintings and furnishings are still arriving. When you have 18-foot ceilings, you have a lot of space to fill. and Psychic Phenomena Gustibus: Don&#8217;t Point That Menu at My Child, Please Basic Training: Modern Marathoners Have Fewer Miles on Them Design That Solves Problems for the World&#8217;s Poor Big Disparities in Judging of Asylum Cases Fighting the Tide, a Few Restaurants Tilt to Tap Water Op-Ed Contributor: What I Think About Evolution Op-Ed Contributor: Physician, Upgrade Thyself Restaurants: Go, Eat, You Never Know Supreme Court Memo: Oral Dissents Give Ginsburg a New Voice on Court Comedy Business Turns to the Web Fault Harsh Methods in Interrogation Truth, Fiction and Lou Dobbs Lawmakers Push for Big Subsidies for Coal Process Google Deal Said to Bring U.S. Scrutiny Iraqi Refugees, in Dire Straits, Turn to the Sex Trade in Syria Giuliani Tempers Tough Image on Campaign Justices' Ruling Limits Suits on Pay Disparity What I Think About Evolution Some Hitherto Staunch G.O.P.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31garden.html Reshaping Their Own Worldview - Their Own Worldview Steve Legato Darke and Melinda Zoehrer used native and nonnative plants like Allegheny pachysandra and Asian Syneilesis aconitifolia, creating a welcoming retreat. Sign to next paragraph Steve Legato Darke and Melinda Zoehrer. Steve Legato Legato Rick Darke bought this one-and-a-half-acre property about 20 years ago, it was nothing to write home about: a modest ranch on a lawn set a bit close to the road, with the usual crabapples and yews. But to the east was a spectacular view of fields rolling down to an old farmhouse and barn, bordered by a forest full of oak and beech, with a meandering creek. Mr. Darke, then curator of plants at Longwood Gardens, in Kennett Square, Pa., soon met his future wife, Melinda Zoehrer, who was then the development director of the Delaware Center for Horticulture, in Wilmington. The two threw themselves into gardening, planting unusual trees and shrubs and turning the lawn into a prairie by scattering seeds gathered from little bluestem, Indian grass and other natives growing along the roadsides. Now and then they sat down on the brow of the hill to drink in the scenery. “We were completely content to put two chairs there and say, ‘The whole thing is our garden,’ ” Mr. Darke said one afternoon about two weeks ago. “But we were always aware that it wouldn’t last forever.” Sure enough, oversize houses now dot the old hay meadow. The farmhouse and barn are up for sale. To screen out the houses, Mr. Darke and Ms. Zoehrer have planted cedars and katsura trees, sweetshrub and shadbush, and turned their gaze inward, to the garden of their own making. They even had a little cabin built out of the hemlock and white pine that lived and died here; it faces the garden. It’s just big enough for sitting around a wood stove in winter or on the porch outside in the rain. They carved spaces at first with grasses like Karl Foerster, a feather reed grass planted in a semicircle to define an outdoor dining area. It formed a billowy curving wall until the seedlings of silverbell trees they planted in between grew tall enough to hold the space. They have planted many other trees, and moved some brought in by birds, like the alternate-leaved dogwood, Cornus alternifolia, that Mr. Darke found as a seedling beneath an old apple tree. He dug it up and replanted it by the front door of his house. Now the tree is 20 feet tall, 30 feet wide, its tiered horizontal branches covered with white flowers in spring, black fruits in summer, red leaves in fall. Beeches have blown in on the wind, their seeds floating up from the forest, and some seem to know just where to plant themselves. Others are moved, or given away. The bottlebrush buckeyes, brought as mere root divisions from Longwood, are now great green mounds of palm-shaped leaves; the winter hazels, started as cuttings from Longwood, fill the air with their perfume in February. Fragrant azaleas — both native and exotic hybrids — bloom beneath the huge whorled leaves of umbrella magnolias. And under the oak, Japanese lady-slippers have opened their crenellated leaves. “They’ve been here for 15 years with no water, no fertilizer,” Mr. Darke said, mentioning the two characteristics that are bound to win his heart. “We don’t have the kind of moisture and acid conditions to keep the native lady-slipper alive.” Mr. Darke has experienced a sea change in his own thinking as he has traveled widely; he now makes a living as a writer, photographer and consultant. He watches what succeeds and fails in this garden, as well as in the public spaces he works on: he has helped develop highway plantings for Delaware’s Department of Transportation, and he is in drought-stricken Australia now to share his knowledge of grasses with public horticulturists. Many grasses are tough and drought tolerant, like Dewey Blue, a coastal switchgrass that Mr. Darke first spotted years ago while searching for roadside plantings. Ms. Zoehrer, who is now the deputy director of the ’s Botanic Garden, has adopted Dewey Blue in her mixed border, where its arching blue-green blades complement the deeper blues and purples of baptisias, irises and salvias. Designing with grasses is the subject of Mr. Darke’s latest book, “The Encyclopedia of Grasses for Livable Landscapes,” published by Timber Press in April, but it has a far more global perspective than his earlier books, “The Color Encyclopedia of Ornamental Grasses” and “The American Woodland Garden,” which emphasized the use of native plants as a means of preserving regional landscapes. This new book opens its boundaries to welcome plants from other parts of the world if they can thrive without water, fertilizer and pesticides; if they are not invasive; and if they can harmonize with the surrounding landscape. “Ten years ago, I was unabashedly aligned with the native plant movement,” Mr. Darke said. “I’m still desperately interested in conserving local things, but sometimes the native plant movement is not nuanced enough.” It doesn’t leave room, in other words, for Japanese lady-slippers, even though they can thrive where natives can’t. It doesn’t acknowledge that many urban landscapes are too degraded for dogwoods and shadbush, and so many other natives that flourished before the concrete and asphalt. But prairie species like little bluestem and sheep’s fescue can flourish in parking lots and along old rail lines, even in Manhattan. In his new book, Mr. Darke concedes that a Japanese maple, like Acer trifolium, which turns bright orange in fall, can fit right in with native purple asters and the red-gold leaves of native sumac. In his own garden, Bowles Golden sedge, from northern Europe, nestles among white variegated Hakone grass, which hails from the Hakone mountains in Japan. Both plants need cool, wet habitats, like the north side of this Pennsylvania house. “A sensible palette takes a global ethic,” Mr. Darke said. “You never want to do anything potentially damaging to any habitat. But if we are going to keep spaces green around the world, we can’t restrict the garden to plants that existed before anybody touched it.” dollar homes in Florida, Wyoming and California Also in Real Estate: U.S. Virgin Islands Make Art & Design &#x00bb; Sarkozys: The French Kennedys?

What can I do? You need only look for your crop in the right place. Edible rhubarb parts are often called stalks, but they are actually leaf stems with the leaves, which are poisonous, removed. Inedible flowering stalks are the only true stalks a rhubarb plant makes. For the largest number of tasty stems plant rhubarb in a sunny spot, in fertile, well-drained soil. Hope for cold winters (rhubarb enjoys ground that freezes several inches down), along with cool summers and plentiful spring rain. Then wait: rhubarb takes several years to reach an ideal size. Once flower stalks rise, leaf stems start toughening. That is why rhubarb is best in spring. Removing flower stalks strengthens plants but will not keep the leaf stems from losing their succulence. Flower stalks normally form in late spring, but they can start earlier when plants are stressed by drought, lack of nutrients or crowding. So fertilizer can sometimes help, and plants older than 15 years should be divided. It might also pay to plant Valentine, a bright red variety known for being a late bloomer. It is less tart than old-fashioned rhubarb, which many consider a virtue. Sources include Hartmann’s Plant Company, or (269) 253-4281, and Miller Nurseries, I want to use climbing hydrangea to cover a 40-foot-wide slope that rises six feet. Could I train the plants to fall down the slope instead of climbing up, or is that too ambitious? The plan itself is fine. Although climbing hydrangea (Hydrangea petiolaris) is a slow grower, its gnarly stems, shiny leaves and lacy white flowers would make a beautiful ground cover. But it is the nature of vines to grow up; they fall only when there is nothing to climb, and this one can climb almost anything. Coercive training like tying stems in place will not work because every new branch will rise. You will be Sisyphus in reverse, constantly pushing the vines down the hill only to see them heading back up, over and over and over again. It is better to work with nature and plant the hydrangeas at the bottom of the slope. That will also help protect them from the droughts that appear increasingly likely.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31sofa.html If a Sofa Doesn&#8217;t Fit, They&#8217;ll Make It Fit - a Sofa Doesn’t Fit, They’ll Make It Fit Robert Caplin for the Squeamish Workers from Dr. Sofa reassemble a couch in a Manhattan apartment. Sign J. COURTNEY SULLIVAN GET calls at all hours of the night,” Shlomi Gal-On said recently, describing the vagaries of his work. “Usually there are tears involved.” Skip to next paragraph Jennifer S. Altman Snow makes a suburban house call. Mr. Gal-On, who is otherwise known as Dr. Sofa, has been in the couch disassembly business in New York for six years. In that time, the demand for his services and those of other disassemblers has increased sharply. But he still remembers each case, each a drama. “One woman called me crying because her couch didn’t fit through the front door of her building,” he said. “When I got to her place it was dark out and she was sitting on the sofa in the middle of the sidewalk, weeping hysterically. She jumped up and threw her arms around me and started shouting, ‘The messiah has come!’ We definitely got some interesting looks from people passing by.” Sofa disassembly has existed as a New York trade since the late 1970s. But in the last few years, major furniture sellers like Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s have begun offering sofas that are 94 inches or more in length and 43 inches or more in depth, compared with maximums of about 86 and 36 a decade ago. The number of desperate calls for help moving such large pieces has also grown, as has the number of businesses offering such help. “Long, overstuffed sofas are so popular right now, and they’re ideal if you have a McMansion,” said Michelle McKoy, a saleswoman at the Domain Home furnishings store on East 22nd Street in Manhattan. “But here in the city we are constantly running into the problem of people who buy them and then can’t get them into the elevator or through the door.” Ms. McKoy said the store’s sofas are 86 to 97 inches long and 36 to 41 inches deep, an increase of about five inches in length and depth from a decade ago. “Like most major furniture stores, we are nationwide, and our furniture really caters to large suburban homes,” she said. Suburban customers have driven the large couch invasion across the board, said Barton Bienenstock, the publisher of Furniture World, a trade magazine. “The furniture industry follows housing trends,” he said. As the size of American houses expanded in this decade, “furniture followed suit, and enormous sofas and high-back chairs have now become the norm.” Five or 10 years ago, he added, such large furniture was limited to the high end of the market, “but now even the moderately priced pieces are huge.” As a result, many one-man disassembly services have sprung up in the New York metropolitan area. The four most established furniture service companies — Dr. Sofa, based in the Bronx; Garry Furniture Service, in Queens; M.J.S. Furniture Service, in Massapequa, N.Y.; and Z Brothers, in Thornwood, N.Y. — all report a boom in business, even though none of them advertise. They charge $200 to $400 to get any couch into any space. “Customers love us because we make it possible for them to get the big couches they want,” said Michael Snow, the founder of M.J.S. He added that his company receives twice as many calls as it did 10 years ago and takes apart an average of six couches a day, six days a week. His competitors are busy, too. Garry Furniture takes apart up to six couches a day, a third more jobs than it was doing three years ago; Z Brothers has had a spike in calls in recent years and does 60 jobs a week on average; and Dr. Sofa gets nearly twice the number of calls it did three years ago and dismantles over 2,000 sofas a year. The disassembly process varies from one job to another, but typically a couch is flipped upside down and the fabric is gently peeled back. One arm is removed, then another. Sometimes the back must be taken off or more creative solutions found. Z Brothers recently removed the back and arms of a new 120-inch couch and it still didn’t fit in the elevator; workers carried the sofa up 10 flights of stairs in an adjoining building, then laid planks across the roof to move it in from above. The services have opened up decorating possibilities for those who would otherwise be forced to buy pieces based only on what could fit through the door: a tiny love seat, say, or a pair of armchairs. dollar homes in Florida, Wyoming and California Also in Real Estate: U.S. Virgin Islands Make Art & Design &#x00bb; Sarkozys: The French Kennedys?

Skip to next paragraph You don’t have to limit your palette in a small space, but be smart about how you use color. “When you’ve got a small apartment, you absolutely can have color, even if the ceilings are low and the apartment doesn’t get a lot of natural light,” said Jamie Drake, a New York-based interior designer noted for his color choices. Mr. Drake recommended painting small spaces “dark and dramatic, instead of light” because “dark color on the walls helps disintegrate the perimeters of the room. Plus, it’ll make your furniture pop.” “It’s a good idea to break up that color a little” by painting the ceiling a lighter color than the walls, he added. He suggested a combination of three Benjamin Moore colors: Crystal Blue on the ceiling, to offset walls painted Bittersweet Chocolate, with the molding painted a complimentary color, like Mayonnaise. If there is no molding, he said, “create the effect of one by making a stripe at the top of the wall” or about six inches above the ceiling line if the ceiling is low, to give the illusion of more height. Joe Nye, a Los Angeles-based interior designer known for his ebullient use of color, agreed. “I resist the notion that painting everything all white will make the room look larger,” he said. Besides, “color is the cheapest decorating trick I know.” “For something really gutsy and instant Park Avenue, a red room is always good. I’ve used Farrow & Ball’s Blazer No. 212 with great results,” Mr. Nye said. “A good green is Farrow & Ball Folly Green No. 76.” No matter how small your space, he said, make sure you paint all the walls, not just one, an approach he describes as “amateurish and straight out of one of those horrible decorating TV shows.” He also suggested stripes to make a low ceiling appear higher. Take the time to do it right, he said, by masking off guides using a plumb line and blue tape. Color can define areas within small spaces. Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan, a New York-based interior designer and co-founder of the Apartment Therapy blog ( ), suggested using two tones. “Put the bold color of your choice in your entry hallway or foyer,” he said, “and go for an off-white tone in the living area on the opposite end.” That makes the entrance area feel intimate, he said, while keeping the horizon point light, creating an expansive effect. Just don’t use stark white, he said. “Go for off-white instead, which is much warmer.” So how to begin? Benjamin Moore’s Web site ( ) has a Personal Color Viewer that displays various combinations of colors for walls, molding and ceilings in sample rooms. Other companies have Web sites with similar features: Farrow & Ball has a “color consultancy” feature that recommends two neutral colors to coordinate with any color you select ( ). And Behr has a program called ColorSmart that helps you sort through shades to find the right color ( If you would like to see how the colors would look in your home, Benjamin Moore sells a $14.95 CD called Personal Color Viewer 2.0. You can upload photographs of your rooms and try the colors on your walls. Or you can buy 2-ounce samples for $3.99, enough to cover a two-foot-square section of wall with two coats of paint.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31greywater.html Kripke Woelfle-Erskine has installed illegal gray water systems like the one at Haut House. Sign to next paragraph Jamie Kripke ALLEN’S modest gray house in the Oakland flatlands would give a building inspector nightmares. Jerry-built pipes protrude at odd angles from the back and sides of the nearly century-old house, running into a cascading series of bathtubs filled with gravel and cattails. White PVC pipe, buckets, milk crates and hoses are strewn about the lot. Inside, there is mysterious — and illegal — plumbing in every room. Ms. Allen, 30, is one of the Greywater Guerrillas, a team focused on promoting and installing clandestine plumbing systems that recycle gray water — the effluent of sinks, showers and washing machines — to flush toilets or irrigate gardens. To her, this house is as much an emblem of her belief system as a home. Although gray water use is legal in California, systems that conform to the state’s complicated code tend to be very expensive, and Ms. Allen and her fellow guerrilla, Cleo Woelfle-Erskine, are out to persuade the world that water recycling can be a simple and affordable option, as well as being a morally essential one. They are part of a larger movement centered in the West — especially in arid regions like Arizona, New Mexico and Southern California — that includes both groups that operate within the law and ones that skirt it. The goal is the reuse of home gray water as a way to live within the region’s ecological means. Using their own experience and contributions from others, they have just published a do-it-yourself guide to gray water systems that is also a manifesto for the movement, “Dam Nation: Dispatches From the Water Underground.” “A lot of people that care about water try to conserve it,” said Ms. Allen, an elementary-school teacher who installed several gray water systems after buying this home — which she named the “Haut House,” for House of Appropriate Urban Technology — four years ago with a housemate. “But this is about changing the way you interact with it.” Mr. Woelfle-Erskine, a writer and teacher who lives on a houseboat with a gray water system in San Pablo, Calif., 10 miles north, added, “It’s about trying to use resources to their full potential and interact with ecosystems in a beneficial way.” In 1994, California became the first state to establish guidelines for gray water use — as most other states have since — and it has become a leader in building industrial-scale gray water systems. The town of Arcata, for example, has an extensive system that serves the entire population of 17,000, and even the state’s oil refineries have gray water systems. But many gray water advocates say that California’s plumbing code — which stipulates things like pipe sizes, burial depths and soil tests based on rules established for septic systems — is prohibitively complicated for private homeowners interested in recycling gray water, and that its requirements are prohibitively expensive. “The code is so overbuilt that I’m beginning to think it’s better to just have everyone do it bootleg,” said Steve Bilson, the founder of ReWater Systems, a company that has installed around 800 code-compliant gray water systems at a cost of about $7,000 each, and who worked as a consultant on California gray water legislation in the 1990s. As a result, many homeowners have installed unpermitted, illegal plumbing, relying on techniques developed by covert researchers like the Greywater Guerrillas. (It is difficult to know how many, since these systems are not registered with any government or organization, but Ms. Allen said that based on her observations there are probably around 2,000 homes equipped with gray water systems, a few legal but most illegal, in the Bay Area alone.) On a recent afternoon, Mr. Woelfle-Erskine stood in the backyard of the Haut House and explained how one of the half-dozen gray water systems there works. A pipe running from the house deposits shower and sink water into an elevated bathtub in the yard that is filled with gravel and reeds, and the roots of plants begin filtering and absorbing contaminants. The water then flows into a second, lower, tub, also containing a reedbed, before flowing into a still-lower tub of floating water hyacinths and small fish.

Conrad/The of Many Mansions Hunt Slonem, a painter, right, bought an 1832 plantation house although he already owns one, as well as three other homes. It wasn&#146;t a question of need, he said, but of &#147;hopeless falling-in-love.&#148; Sign to next paragraph A Work in Progress Fred R. Conrad/The come and go in the homes of the painter Hunt Slonem, both the quick and the dead. There’s the handyman, who’s brought a stray cat that’s been screaming its head off all morning; the antique picker who has spread his wares outside; the friends who have stopped by to visit Mr. Slonem in his latest acquisition, an 1832 plantation house called Lakeside, pink if you please, as surprising in this community of shoebox houses as an aged diva in a pink organdy dress at McDonald’s. Also as indifferent, inasmuch as a house can be indifferent, to the bruising of time. The long dining room table is set with pink porcelain plates, a few of which have been over-set with paper plates. Lunch is Louisiana takeout: boudin sausage, pecan pie, a local desert called ooey gooey. The talk is of a portrait, just hung, of Catherine of Aragon. Then Mr. Slonem’s caretaker calls with word of an interloper: a voodoo head, or something that looks like one, has been found in the third-floor ceiling earlier in the week and tucked away in a kitchen cabinet. Mr. Slonem goes at once to retrieve the head, a mud-colored walnut-size carving of a skull, with a tiny straw hat and pointy appendages. Then he retreats to make a call. When he returns to the table, Mr. Slonem is relieved: the psychic did say her stomach hurt when he first mentioned the head, he says. But she believes whatever powers it once had to be long gone. There are those who scoff at mysticism. Mr. Slonem, a 55-year-old New York painter whose work, both artistic and domestic, is the subject of a forthcoming book, “Pleasure Palace: The Art and Homes of Hunt Slonem,” to be published by powerHouse Books, and whose paintings are in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , does not. The spirit world figures in his life, his art, his five homes. He refers to psychics the way successful businessmen refer to their lawyers. “Tell her the wire transfers haven’t come through,” he tells a caller. “My psychic says by the end of the week.” Speaking with Mr. Slonem, it is easy to become confused, for in referring to this person or that he does not distinguish between the living and the dead. (“The countess predicted I would buy another plantation,” he says, the countess being one Xacha Obrenevitch, a spiritualist of the 1920s who, as Mr. Slonem understands it, was an intimate of Rudolph Valentino. Mr. Slonem has also heard from Valentino, who once came to him when he was meditating and demanded to be painted dancing the tango. The series sold rather well, Mr. Slonem says.) THE notion that less is more has never appealed to Mr. Slonem. In New York City he rents 30,000 square feet — about 80 rooms — of former office space in the West Village, which houses 35 birds, tropical plants and wildly colored areas. The yearly rent is about $300,000, a spectacular deal in New York. He also owns the Cordt mansion, a 19th-century home in Kingston, N.Y., which he bought in 2001 for $770,000, and the Albania plantation house in Jeanerette, La., a property so grand that it was used as a setting for the 2006 remake of “All the King’s Men,” inspired by Gov. Huey Long of Louisiana. (The mansion’s appearance in the film was a good thing, Mr. Slonem says, because the money he was paid helped offset the cost of termite damage.) His newest home, here in rural Louisiana, is a faded, dream-inspiring pile with 18-foot ceilings, circular staircases and a filigree wrought-iron entrance. Inside, where there was significant deterioration, some walls have been repaired and painted. The red room, on the ground floor, is really red, with red walls and a half dozen red velvet sofas. But for the most part the old plaster walls, here yellowed and peeling, there the color of neglected pearls, have been left to be what they are. Mr. Slonem’s antiques, some from expensive shops, some from flea markets, seem to have always been here. When he takes a pair of 19th-century girandoles to the third-floor sitting room and places them on the mantel, one feels as if the house is reaching out to embrace them. Mr. Slonem bought the house, originally listed at $1.2 million, for about $625,000 in 2005. He has now spent, by his calculation, a few hundred thousand in renovation: completely rewiring the house, replacing rotted floorboards, refurbishing plumbing and the pool. Not included in those figures are the furnishings. There is also Mr. Slonem’s own brightly colored art; hothouse flowers and birds, saints and of course Valentino share space with portraits of Louisiana landowners long dead. And Mr. Slonem is not finished: paintings and furnishings are still arriving. When you have 18-foot ceilings, you have a lot of space to fill. and Psychic Phenomena Should a Kid Start Kindergarten?

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31garden.html Reshaping Their Own Worldview - Their Own Worldview Steve Legato for Darke and Melinda Zoehrer used native and nonnative plants like Allegheny pachysandra and Asian Syneilesis aconitifolia, creating a welcoming retreat. Sign to next paragraph Steve Legato for Darke and Melinda Zoehrer. Steve Legato for Legato for Rick Darke bought this one-and-a-half-acre property about 20 years ago, it was nothing to write home about: a modest ranch on a lawn set a bit close to the road, with the usual crabapples and yews. But to the east was a spectacular view of fields rolling down to an old farmhouse and barn, bordered by a forest full of oak and beech, with a meandering creek. Mr. Darke, then curator of plants at Longwood Gardens, in Kennett Square, Pa., soon met his future wife, Melinda Zoehrer, who was then the development director of the Delaware Center for Horticulture, in Wilmington. The two threw themselves into gardening, planting unusual trees and shrubs and turning the lawn into a prairie by scattering seeds gathered from little bluestem, Indian grass and other natives growing along the roadsides. Now and then they sat down on the brow of the hill to drink in the scenery. “We were completely content to put two chairs there and say, ‘The whole thing is our garden,’ ” Mr. Darke said one afternoon about two weeks ago. “But we were always aware that it wouldn’t last forever.” Sure enough, oversize houses now dot the old hay meadow. The farmhouse and barn are up for sale. To screen out the houses, Mr. Darke and Ms. Zoehrer have planted cedars and katsura trees, sweetshrub and shadbush, and turned their gaze inward, to the garden of their own making. They even had a little cabin built out of the hemlock and white pine that lived and died here; it faces the garden. It’s just big enough for sitting around a wood stove in winter or on the porch outside in the rain. They carved spaces at first with grasses like Karl Foerster, a feather reed grass planted in a semicircle to define an outdoor dining area. It formed a billowy curving wall until the seedlings of silverbell trees they planted in between grew tall enough to hold the space. They have planted many other trees, and moved some brought in by birds, like the alternate-leaved dogwood, Cornus alternifolia, that Mr. Darke found as a seedling beneath an old apple tree. He dug it up and replanted it by the front door of his house. Now the tree is 20 feet tall, 30 feet wide, its tiered horizontal branches covered with white flowers in spring, black fruits in summer, red leaves in fall. Beeches have blown in on the wind, their seeds floating up from the forest, and some seem to know just where to plant themselves. Others are moved, or given away. The bottlebrush buckeyes, brought as mere root divisions from Longwood, are now great green mounds of palm-shaped leaves; the winter hazels, started as cuttings from Longwood, fill the air with their perfume in February. Fragrant azaleas — both native and exotic hybrids — bloom beneath the huge whorled leaves of umbrella magnolias. And under the oak, Japanese lady-slippers have opened their crenellated leaves. “They’ve been here for 15 years with no water, no fertilizer,” Mr. Darke said, mentioning the two characteristics that are bound to win his heart. “We don’t have the kind of moisture and acid conditions to keep the native lady-slipper alive.” Mr. Darke has experienced a sea change in his own thinking as he has traveled widely; he now makes a living as a writer, photographer and consultant. He watches what succeeds and fails in this garden, as well as in the public spaces he works on: he has helped develop highway plantings for Delaware’s Department of Transportation, and he is in drought-stricken Australia now to share his knowledge of grasses with public horticulturists. Many grasses are tough and drought tolerant, like Dewey Blue, a coastal switchgrass that Mr. Darke first spotted years ago while searching for roadside plantings. Ms. Zoehrer, who is now the deputy director of the ’s Botanic Garden, has adopted Dewey Blue in her mixed border, where its arching blue-green blades complement the deeper blues and purples of baptisias, irises and salvias. Designing with grasses is the subject of Mr. Darke’s latest book, “The Encyclopedia of Grasses for Livable Landscapes,” published by Timber Press in April, but it has a far more global perspective than his earlier books, “The Color Encyclopedia of Ornamental Grasses” and “The American Woodland Garden,” which emphasized the use of native plants as a means of preserving regional landscapes. This new book opens its boundaries to welcome plants from other parts of the world if they can thrive without water, fertilizer and pesticides; if they are not invasive; and if they can harmonize with the surrounding landscape. “Ten years ago, I was unabashedly aligned with the native plant movement,” Mr. Darke said. “I’m still desperately interested in conserving local things, but sometimes the native plant movement is not nuanced enough.” It doesn’t leave room, in other words, for Japanese lady-slippers, even though they can thrive where natives can’t. It doesn’t acknowledge that many urban landscapes are too degraded for dogwoods and shadbush, and so many other natives that flourished before the concrete and asphalt. But prairie species like little bluestem and sheep’s fescue can flourish in parking lots and along old rail lines, even in Manhattan. In his new book, Mr. Darke concedes that a Japanese maple, like Acer trifolium, which turns bright orange in fall, can fit right in with native purple asters and the red-gold leaves of native sumac. In his own garden, Bowles Golden sedge, from northern Europe, nestles among white variegated Hakone grass, which hails from the Hakone mountains in Japan. Both plants need cool, wet habitats, like the north side of this Pennsylvania house. “A sensible palette takes a global ethic,” Mr. Darke said. “You never want to do anything potentially damaging to any habitat. But if we are going to keep spaces green around the world, we can’t restrict the garden to plants that existed before anybody touched it.” the Frugal Traveler on his 12-week cross-country journey See how the trip began What did he think of the Armuchee Bluegrass Festival?

What can I do? You need only look for your crop in the right place. Edible rhubarb parts are often called stalks, but they are actually leaf stems with the leaves, which are poisonous, removed. Inedible flowering stalks are the only true stalks a rhubarb plant makes. For the largest number of tasty stems plant rhubarb in a sunny spot, in fertile, well-drained soil. Hope for cold winters (rhubarb enjoys ground that freezes several inches down), along with cool summers and plentiful spring rain. Then wait: rhubarb takes several years to reach an ideal size. Once flower stalks rise, leaf stems start toughening. That is why rhubarb is best in spring. Removing flower stalks strengthens plants but will not keep the leaf stems from losing their succulence. Flower stalks normally form in late spring, but they can start earlier when plants are stressed by drought, lack of nutrients or crowding. So fertilizer can sometimes help, and plants older than 15 years should be divided. It might also pay to plant Valentine, a bright red variety known for being a late bloomer. It is less tart than old-fashioned rhubarb, which many consider a virtue. Sources include Hartmann’s Plant Company, or (269) 253-4281, and Miller Nurseries, I want to use climbing hydrangea to cover a 40-foot-wide slope that rises six feet. Could I train the plants to fall down the slope instead of climbing up, or is that too ambitious? The plan itself is fine. Although climbing hydrangea (Hydrangea petiolaris) is a slow grower, its gnarly stems, shiny leaves and lacy white flowers would make a beautiful ground cover. But it is the nature of vines to grow up; they fall only when there is nothing to climb, and this one can climb almost anything. Coercive training like tying stems in place will not work because every new branch will rise. You will be Sisyphus in reverse, constantly pushing the vines down the hill only to see them heading back up, over and over and over again. It is better to work with nature and plant the hydrangeas at the bottom of the slope. That will also help protect them from the droughts that appear increasingly likely.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31sofa.html If a Sofa Doesn&#8217;t Fit, They&#8217;ll Make It Fit - a Sofa Doesn’t Fit, They’ll Make It Fit Robert Caplin for for the Squeamish Workers from Dr. Sofa reassemble a couch in a Manhattan apartment. Sign J. COURTNEY SULLIVAN GET calls at all hours of the night,” Shlomi Gal-On said recently, describing the vagaries of his work. “Usually there are tears involved.” Skip to next paragraph Jennifer S. Altman for Snow makes a suburban house call. Mr. Gal-On, who is otherwise known as Dr. Sofa, has been in the couch disassembly business in New York for six years. In that time, the demand for his services and those of other disassemblers has increased sharply. But he still remembers each case, each a drama. “One woman called me crying because her couch didn’t fit through the front door of her building,” he said. “When I got to her place it was dark out and she was sitting on the sofa in the middle of the sidewalk, weeping hysterically. She jumped up and threw her arms around me and started shouting, ‘The messiah has come!’ We definitely got some interesting looks from people passing by.” Sofa disassembly has existed as a New York trade since the late 1970s. But in the last few years, major furniture sellers like Pottery Barn, Restoration Hardware, Bloomingdale’s and Macy’s have begun offering sofas that are 94 inches or more in length and 43 inches or more in depth, compared with maximums of about 86 and 36 a decade ago. The number of desperate calls for help moving such large pieces has also grown, as has the number of businesses offering such help. “Long, overstuffed sofas are so popular right now, and they’re ideal if you have a McMansion,” said Michelle McKoy, a saleswoman at the Domain Home furnishings store on East 22nd Street in Manhattan. “But here in the city we are constantly running into the problem of people who buy them and then can’t get them into the elevator or through the door.” Ms. McKoy said the store’s sofas are 86 to 97 inches long and 36 to 41 inches deep, an increase of about five inches in length and depth from a decade ago. “Like most major furniture stores, we are nationwide, and our furniture really caters to large suburban homes,” she said. Suburban customers have driven the large couch invasion across the board, said Barton Bienenstock, the publisher of Furniture World, a trade magazine. “The furniture industry follows housing trends,” he said. As the size of American houses expanded in this decade, “furniture followed suit, and enormous sofas and high-back chairs have now become the norm.” Five or 10 years ago, he added, such large furniture was limited to the high end of the market, “but now even the moderately priced pieces are huge.” As a result, many one-man disassembly services have sprung up in the New York metropolitan area. The four most established furniture service companies — Dr. Sofa, based in the Bronx; Garry Furniture Service, in Queens; M.J.S. Furniture Service, in Massapequa, N.Y.; and Z Brothers, in Thornwood, N.Y. — all report a boom in business, even though none of them advertise. They charge $200 to $400 to get any couch into any space. “Customers love us because we make it possible for them to get the big couches they want,” said Michael Snow, the founder of M.J.S. He added that his company receives twice as many calls as it did 10 years ago and takes apart an average of six couches a day, six days a week. His competitors are busy, too. Garry Furniture takes apart up to six couches a day, a third more jobs than it was doing three years ago; Z Brothers has had a spike in calls in recent years and does 60 jobs a week on average; and Dr. Sofa gets nearly twice the number of calls it did three years ago and dismantles over 2,000 sofas a year. The disassembly process varies from one job to another, but typically a couch is flipped upside down and the fabric is gently peeled back. One arm is removed, then another. Sometimes the back must be taken off or more creative solutions found. Z Brothers recently removed the back and arms of a new 120-inch couch and it still didn’t fit in the elevator; workers carried the sofa up 10 flights of stairs in an adjoining building, then laid planks across the roof to move it in from above. The services have opened up decorating possibilities for those who would otherwise be forced to buy pieces based only on what could fit through the door: a tiny love seat, say, or a pair of armchairs. the Frugal Traveler on his 12-week cross-country journey See how the trip began What did he think of the Armuchee Bluegrass Festival?

Skip to next paragraph You don’t have to limit your palette in a small space, but be smart about how you use color. “When you’ve got a small apartment, you absolutely can have color, even if the ceilings are low and the apartment doesn’t get a lot of natural light,” said Jamie Drake, a New York-based interior designer noted for his color choices. Mr. Drake recommended painting small spaces “dark and dramatic, instead of light” because “dark color on the walls helps disintegrate the perimeters of the room. Plus, it’ll make your furniture pop.” “It’s a good idea to break up that color a little” by painting the ceiling a lighter color than the walls, he added. He suggested a combination of three Benjamin Moore colors: Crystal Blue on the ceiling, to offset walls painted Bittersweet Chocolate, with the molding painted a complimentary color, like Mayonnaise. If there is no molding, he said, “create the effect of one by making a stripe at the top of the wall” or about six inches above the ceiling line if the ceiling is low, to give the illusion of more height. Joe Nye, a Los Angeles-based interior designer known for his ebullient use of color, agreed. “I resist the notion that painting everything all white will make the room look larger,” he said. Besides, “color is the cheapest decorating trick I know.” “For something really gutsy and instant Park Avenue, a red room is always good. I’ve used Farrow & Ball’s Blazer No. 212 with great results,” Mr. Nye said. “A good green is Farrow & Ball Folly Green No. 76.” No matter how small your space, he said, make sure you paint all the walls, not just one, an approach he describes as “amateurish and straight out of one of those horrible decorating TV shows.” He also suggested stripes to make a low ceiling appear higher. Take the time to do it right, he said, by masking off guides using a plumb line and blue tape. Color can define areas within small spaces. Maxwell Gillingham-Ryan, a New York-based interior designer and co-founder of the Apartment Therapy blog ( ), suggested using two tones. “Put the bold color of your choice in your entry hallway or foyer,” he said, “and go for an off-white tone in the living area on the opposite end.” That makes the entrance area feel intimate, he said, while keeping the horizon point light, creating an expansive effect. Just don’t use stark white, he said. “Go for off-white instead, which is much warmer.” So how to begin? Benjamin Moore’s Web site ( ) has a Personal Color Viewer that displays various combinations of colors for walls, molding and ceilings in sample rooms. Other companies have Web sites with similar features: Farrow & Ball has a “color consultancy” feature that recommends two neutral colors to coordinate with any color you select ( ). And Behr has a program called ColorSmart that helps you sort through shades to find the right color ( If you would like to see how the colors would look in your home, Benjamin Moore sells a $14.95 CD called Personal Color Viewer 2.0. You can upload photographs of your rooms and try the colors on your walls. Or you can buy 2-ounce samples for $3.99, enough to cover a two-foot-square section of wall with two coats of paint.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/garden/31greywater.html The Dirty Water Underground - Dirty Water Underground Jamie Kripke for Woelfle-Erskine has installed illegal gray water systems like the one at Haut House. Sign to next paragraph Jamie Kripke for ALLEN’S modest gray house in the Oakland flatlands would give a building inspector nightmares. Jerry-built pipes protrude at odd angles from the back and sides of the nearly century-old house, running into a cascading series of bathtubs filled with gravel and cattails. White PVC pipe, buckets, milk crates and hoses are strewn about the lot. Inside, there is mysterious — and illegal — plumbing in every room. Ms. Allen, 30, is one of the Greywater Guerrillas, a team focused on promoting and installing clandestine plumbing systems that recycle gray water — the effluent of sinks, showers and washing machines — to flush toilets or irrigate gardens. To her, this house is as much an emblem of her belief system as a home. Although gray water use is legal in California, systems that conform to the state’s complicated code tend to be very expensive, and Ms. Allen and her fellow guerrilla, Cleo Woelfle-Erskine, are out to persuade the world that water recycling can be a simple and affordable option, as well as being a morally essential one. They are part of a larger movement centered in the West — especially in arid regions like Arizona, New Mexico and Southern California — that includes both groups that operate within the law and ones that skirt it. The goal is the reuse of home gray water as a way to live within the region’s ecological means. Using their own experience and contributions from others, they have just published a do-it-yourself guide to gray water systems that is also a manifesto for the movement, “Dam Nation: Dispatches From the Water Underground.” “A lot of people that care about water try to conserve it,” said Ms. Allen, an elementary-school teacher who installed several gray water systems after buying this home — which she named the “Haut House,” for House of Appropriate Urban Technology — four years ago with a housemate. “But this is about changing the way you interact with it.” Mr. Woelfle-Erskine, a writer and teacher who lives on a houseboat with a gray water system in San Pablo, Calif., 10 miles north, added, “It’s about trying to use resources to their full potential and interact with ecosystems in a beneficial way.” In 1994, California became the first state to establish guidelines for gray water use — as most other states have since — and it has become a leader in building industrial-scale gray water systems. The town of Arcata, for example, has an extensive system that serves the entire population of 17,000, and even the state’s oil refineries have gray water systems. But many gray water advocates say that California’s plumbing code — which stipulates things like pipe sizes, burial depths and soil tests based on rules established for septic systems — is prohibitively complicated for private homeowners interested in recycling gray water, and that its requirements are prohibitively expensive. “The code is so overbuilt that I’m beginning to think it’s better to just have everyone do it bootleg,” said Steve Bilson, the founder of ReWater Systems, a company that has installed around 800 code-compliant gray water systems at a cost of about $7,000 each, and who worked as a consultant on California gray water legislation in the 1990s. As a result, many homeowners have installed unpermitted, illegal plumbing, relying on techniques developed by covert researchers like the Greywater Guerrillas. (It is difficult to know how many, since these systems are not registered with any government or organization, but Ms. Allen said that based on her observations there are probably around 2,000 homes equipped with gray water systems, a few legal but most illegal, in the Bay Area alone.) On a recent afternoon, Mr. Woelfle-Erskine stood in the backyard of the Haut House and explained how one of the half-dozen gray water systems there works. A pipe running from the house deposits shower and sink water into an elevated bathtub in the yard that is filled with gravel and reeds, and the roots of plants begin filtering and absorbing contaminants. The water then flows into a second, lower, tub, also containing a reedbed, before flowing into a still-lower tub of floating water hyacinths and small fish.
