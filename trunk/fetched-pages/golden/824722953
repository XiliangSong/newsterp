Now this same penchant for working on a monumental scale has made Mr. Kiefer the ideal artist to inaugurate an annual solo show — called, appropriately, Monumenta — that opened on Wednesday in the cavernous space of Paris. It continues through July 8. Mr. Kiefer, 62, whose specific exhibition is titled “Falling Stars,” will be followed next year by Richard Serra, the American sculptor of weighty shapes in sheet metal. Christian Boltanski, the French installation artist who often fills entire rooms with one work of art, has been chosen for 2009. Though the artists have the privilege — and challenge — of presenting their art in a unique setting, the show’s organizer, the French government, hopes to be the main beneficiary. Having recently completed a prolonged $135 million restoration of a vast, light-drenched glass and steel palace originally built for the 1900 Universal Exhibition here — the French Culture Ministry has been struggling to find a mission for the space, which is 150 feet wide, 660 feet long and 150 feet tall at its highest point. At the same time the government has been trying to kick-start public interest in contemporary art for several years now. Last year it sponsored “La Force de l’Art” (“The Strength of Art”), an exhibition of French-based artists But the show was poorly received, not least because the art was overwhelmed by the space. Monumenta, then, is designed both to show off to create a buzz around today’s new art. For Mr. Kiefer it also represents his grand debut in Paris. A soft-spoken and introspective man, he made his name in Germany and the United States in the 1970s and 1980s with large-format paintings and lead sculptures that stirred buried memories of the Holocaust and delved into the myths of Germany’s past. Britons discovered his art through an installation at the Royal Academy of Arts and a Cube Gallery in London. His work also features in the permanent collection of the Guggenheim Bilbao, in northwestern Spain, which, by coincidence, is holding a survey exhibition of his recent paintings through Sept. 3. But while Mr. Kiefer presented six 30-foot-high paintings in the chapel of the Hôpital de la Salpêtrière in 2000 and held a Thaddaeus Ropac here last year, it is only now that the Parisian public is being introduced to the unusual work he has been developing at La Ribaute, his retreat outside Barjac in southern France. While “Falling Stars” includes new paintings, Mr. Kiefer has transferred some of La Ribaute to building seven stand-alone houses, or galleries, each some 50 feet high, and bringing three concrete towers that normally stand on his property. This installation has in turn had the desired effect of occupying the palace, both physically and visually. His show’s title is itself a reference to its glass roof. “We are beneath the sky, below the firmament,” he told reporters. Yet as much as with his constructions, Mr. Kiefer fills the space with the visual and intellectual force of his art, much of it inspired by literature, notably the poetry of the Romanian Paul Celan and the Austrian Ingeborg Bachmann, the Bible and cabalistic writings. Mr. Kiefer himself has often noted that in his youth he wavered between becoming a writer and a painter. No less distinctive are the materials he uses, with sunflowers, branches, pieces of cloth, terra cotta pottery, plaster, dried mud and lead objects often attached to thick layers of paint. Similarly he creates what he calls books with sheets of lead, some of which he rescued from Cologne Cathedral when its roof was being replaced some years ago. The show’s first house, “Land of Fog,” inspired by Bachmann’s poem of the same name, presents a single painting that suggests a sacrificial Aztec pyramid. At its foot lies a naked man — “It is me,” Mr. Kiefer said — below a large terra cotta heart attached to the painting. Anselm Kiefer’s “Falling Stars,” the first exhibition in the Monumenta series, runs through July 8 3 Avenue du Général Eisenhower, Paris; monumenta.com or 33 1 44-13-17-17.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/books/31masl.html From Hitmaker to Defendant, a of the Times From Hitmaker to Defendant, a Spector, the record producer, shown in 1975, is the subject of a new biography, &#8220;Tearing by Mick Brown, right. December 2002 the British journalist Mick Brown was driven by ’s chauffeur in Phil Spector’s white Rolls-Royce to Phil Spector’s gloomy castle in Alhambra, Calif., for a spooky interview with Phil Spector, who wore black silk pajamas and made a grand entrance to the strains of Handel. DOWN THE WALL OF SOUND The Rise and Fall of Phil Spector Illustrated. 452 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. Times Topics: Phil Spector Two months later Lana Clarkson, a tall blond actress who had starred in two “Barbarian Queen” movies and delivered the line “Hi” in “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” died violently at the same house. The opening chapter of Mr. Brown’s Spector biography insinuates that the visiting interviewer might also have been in peril. But it was Mr. Spector, the tiny, Napoleonic, gun-toting rock ’n’ roll genius who was in jeopardy on that day. Mr. Brown was in the midst of compiling a seriously damning, though not even actively malevolent, set of stories about the Spector life and oeuvre. Grouped together in the bloodcurdling biography they add up to a portrait of pure self-interest and cruelty, tempered only slightly by the great musical achievements of Mr. Spector’s golden age in the early 1960s. This book would feel like a crime story even if its subject were not currently on trial for Ms. Clarkson’s murder. Mr. Brown is not a muckraker. Nor is he really discovering anything new, at least not in the first half of Mr. Spector’s story. As many Spector acquaintances and scorched musical collaborators report, Mr. Spector’s autocratic nature was thought to have obvious sources. There was his father’s suicide (which led to the hit “To Know Him Is to Love Him,” with its title taken from Benjamin Spector’s gravestone). There were an overbearing mother and sister, Bertha and Shirley. There was also the possibility of inbreeding, since this rock maestro had both paternal and maternal grandfathers named George Spector and Phil’s parents were thought to be first cousins. There were the schoolyard bullies whose persecution supposedly explained the adult Phil Spector’s cadre of bodyguards. This first part of after sketchily defining Mr. Spector’s pathology, is mostly devoted to explaining how the famous Wall of Sound was created. For those who know the musical history of this period, which has been expertly documented elsewhere, this part of the book holds little surprise beyond the elaborate skein of creative connections. Mr. Brown underscores the cause-and-effect links between certain recordings, like the Beach Boys’ “Don’t Worry Baby” with Mr. Spector’s production for the Ronettes, “Be My Baby,” or the Four Tops’ “Baby, I Need Your Loving” with the monster, Spector-produced Righteous Brothers hit, “You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feeling.” He also explains the ubiquitousness of singers like Darlene Love, who might perform under different names at Mr. Spector’s whim and then wind up with nothing to show for it. The consensus expressed in the book is that Mr. Spector habitually betrayed and discarded musicians after he was through with them. “Rather than develop his artists’ careers,” Mr. Brown quotes the Atlantic Records pioneer Jerry Wexler as saying, “Phil developed himself.” But just as the Spector mystique was being hyperbolically immortalized by ’s 1964 magazine article “The First Tycoon of Teen” (which, as Mr. Brown points out, compares Mr. Spector with ), the Spector career hit a ceiling. This book maintains that Mr. Spector, unlike some of the artists he disparages (notably the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson), began to stall as the world changed around him. “He was like a little boy who does something really cute and gets applauded for that,” says Bruce Johnston, the former Beach Boy, “and so he starts figuring out how to get the applause back, but then it’s not quite as cute again.” At this point the book begins to overflow with not-quite-as-cute effluvia. Borrowing from the sad, lurid memoir of Ronnie Spector, whose career with the Ronettes took a nosedive after she married her producer and disappeared under Mr. Spector’s possessive wing, it describes a lonely household that became a prison. Not for nothing was “Citizen Kane” Mr. Spector’s favorite film at the time. The Manson murders and the disastrous adoptions of three Spector children (later virtually abandoned by their father) only worsened the atmosphere of deterioration. In court testimony it was alleged that Ms. Spector drank to “shut out the continuous stream of shrieking by the respondent.” Said respondent would go on to pay Ms. Spector a court- ordered interim support payment of $1,250 in nickels. Professionally he grew to be “like Sherlock Holmes without a case.” His magisterial “Be My Baby” became background music in an advertisement for Cialis, the erectile dysfunction drug. And his attempted comebacks and collaborations (the most successful of which, in Mr. Brown’s opinion, being ’s “Imagine”) grew ever crazier. He famously aimed a gun at the neck of the singer and declared “Leonard, I love you,” prompting Mr. Cohen to reply drolly “I hope you do, Phil.” Working with Mr. Spector, says someone who attended their collaborative sessions, “gave Leonard a chance to perfect his Shaolin priesthood stuff and become one with the universe.” That was the degree of patience a Spector run-in required. While with a title that perfectly describes its subject’s gift for self-destruction, does find those who appreciated Mr. Spector’s brilliance, humor and occasional wild generosity (“Phil, how can you give a thousand-dollar tip to the waiters but you won’t pay over scale to the musicians?”), it mostly traces an upward trajectory of anger and paranoia, fueled by alcohol and made ever more alarming by the Spector arsenal. Whatever the circumstances surrounding the deadly firing of a gun in Ms. Clarkson’s mouth in the early hours of Feb. 3, 2003, Mr. Spector’s initial response is as telling as anything that may emerge from his trial. He felt annoyed. He felt put upon. He felt misunderstood. And he felt aggrieved. Ms. Clarkson, he said, had had absolutely no right to blow her head off inside his castle.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/movies/31loha.html Lindsay Lohan Lohan, a Mix of Sympathy and Scorn ANGELES, May 30 — It’s already fairly clear which image of will be most indelible in the summer of 2007, and it’s not a promotional still from her new movie, it’s a paparazzi photograph of this flame-haired actress passed out in a car in the wee hours of Sunday morning, sprawled across the passenger seat, her hair peeking out from a gray hooded sweatshirt, her mouth slack-jawed. That image shouted from the cover of tabloid newspapers on Monday as if to herald the umpteenth public wipeout for the 20-year-old actress, who was arrested here Saturday for driving under the influence after she crashed her Mercedes into a tree along the residential strip of Sunset Boulevard. On Monday she checked into a Malibu rehabilitation facility called Promises. And quick as a shot (no, not that kind), all of Hollywood was a-clatter with the sound of clucking tongues over advice not taken. So sad, everyone said, such a waste: so pretty, so talented — so uninsurable. Like too, the spectacle of a young woman’s self-destruction seemed to demand expressions of sympathy along with the requisite scorn. But hard reality was also quickly setting in. Across this close-knit town, decision makers were mentally wiping Ms. Lohan from their short lists. One studio chief who has worked with Ms. Lohan said that he would not hire her until she proved herself healthy and reliable. (Confident at least of this possibility, he would only comment anonymously.) “My hope for her would be that her growing pains get sorted out,” said Valerie Van Galder, president for marketing for Columbia Tristar. “The wild child used to be a phase you grew out of. This feels different. I think now there’s more attention to minutiae, and you’re stalked everywhere you go.” To be hired again, some said, Ms. Lohan might have to be more than sober. She would need perhaps to post her salary as bond, or pay for her own insurance, even on an independent film. Ms. Lohan was meant to start a new movie this week, an independent production titled about two female con artists, also starring . The film’s producers met on Wednesday to decide whether to replace Ms. Lohan or hold off while she spent a month under wraps. Many could say they saw this coming. Ms. Lohan has already worn out her welcome at Disney, where she made four films, including the hits “Parent Trap,” when she was a precocious 11-year-old, and in 2003, in which she played a thoroughly credible middle-aged mom. But by the time she starred in in 2005, she was already a paparazzi fixture, and Disney was worried enough to sit her down for a talking-to. “I told her before the movie began, ‘This is the moment in your career where you either become ,” recalled Nina Jacobson, who ran the studio at the time and is now a producer at DreamWorks. And while filming went fine, Ms. Lohan went missing during the international press junket in Europe. “The image issue aside, professionalism-wise we were disappointed,” Ms. Jacobson said. “And I was sad, because she’s so charismatic and appealing on screen. It’s a very sad thing to see it go to waste this way.” Those in Ms. Lohan’s camp find all this hand wringing to be disingenuous. One person close to Ms. Lohan pointed out that Disney handed the actress a $1 million bonus check for “Freaky Friday,” an invitation for her , then a 16-year-old, to indulge irresponsible impulses. And James G. Robinson, a producer of “Georgia Rule” who had a letter sent to Ms. Lohan at her Chateau Marmont hotel room last year calling her “a spoiled child” for failing to show up for her scheduled call times (the letter was conveniently leaked to the news media even as it was delivered), later invited the actress to be his date to a At Sony the hope was that Ms. Lohan would right herself, and soon. The studio has a thriller starring Ms. Lohan, “I Know Who Killed Me,” out in late July. Ms. Lohan’s publicist, Leslie Sloane-Zelnick, said her client intended to do the publicity for the film, but admitted that things were in limbo. “She will work for that film, she wants to work for that film,” Ms. Sloane-Zelnick said. “But we’re waiting on her situation, in general. At the end of the day, her talent will prevail. Someone will take a chance on her.” (1 of 35) REVIEW; Hey, California Girl, Don't Mess With Grandma FILM REVIEW; The Way We Were, Way Back in June of '68 A Big Star May Not a Profitable Movie Make FILM REVIEW; Altman's Casual Chaos Meets Keillor's Rhubarb-Tinged Nostalgia (1 of 35) &#x00bb; Seaver Autographed Baseball

Garden’s purchase of a for-profit company is unheard of in the performing-arts world, although several orchestras have begun their own record labels. But the opera house’s chief executive, Tony Hall, said its success depends on developing a money-making arm and disseminating productions beyond the people sitting in the seats. “What this is about is buying content,” a telephone interview from London. “This gives us content that we intend to use for DVDs, high-definition DVDs, video on demand, TV channels, cinema relays — the works.” It is also “an extension of our brand,” he said. “We are trying to get more people globally to appreciate what’s going on at the Royal Opera House.” The house said it paid £5.7 million (about $11.3 million) to buy Opus Arte from its Dutch holding company, Opus Arte BV. The money came from a fund designated for capital and infrastructure projects. house was one of several bidders for Opus Arte, and not even the highest. He declined to identify the others. This latest foray into the digital realm is part of a wave of transformation in a traditionally live art form born 400 years ago in the courts of Europe.

The Opéra National de Paris said it planned to negotiate with its unions to simulcast in movie theaters. Opera companies are offering downloads and streaming online, and providing outdoor projections. The trend has raised questions about what effects extensive video broadcasting will have on casting choices, on how people experience opera, on voices and on attendance. But opera executives, desperate to maintain audiences, have embraced the idea. Of the Royal Opera acquisition, Marc A. Scorca, president of Opera America, said: “It again demonstrates the close link between opera and today’s multimedia world. Opera is the traditional art form that translates most effectively to multimedia representation.” Opus Arte, based in East Sussex, England, produces video recordings of live opera productions, sometimes in conjunction with local networks, licenses them to broadcasters and distributes them on DVD. It has about 140 titles in its catalog, and it records at opera houses across Europe. It also produces dance performances. The Royal Opera House has about 40 recordings of its own opera and ballet productions. It said that Opus Arte would distribute those and future Royal Opera performances. The acquisition is expected to help the house expand into releases in movie theaters, on video-on-demand and on pay-per-view and through the Internet. Opus Arte also has a deal to provide programming for a soon-to-be announced satellite channel in Europe, Mr. Hall said. The channel will provide cultural fare in high definition. Arts Council England, which provides public money to the Royal Opera and other institutions, approved the deal. One British music critic questioned the wisdom of the house taking on a commercial venture with a large back catalog of performances by other companies. “I’m just slightly baffled by the whole thing,” said John Allison, editor of the British magazine Opera and a critic for The Sunday Telegraph. “I can see obviously how all opera houses like to plan for world domination, and maybe this is part of it.” More seriously he questioned whether Opus Arte’s new owners would promote the productions of other companies as much as their own, or whether the distributor’s profits would be significant. “It obviously gives them control over the distribution of their own performances,” he said. “Is it effectively going to become their own label?” Arte, which came burdened with nearly $4 million in debt, earned about $593,000 last year and would be charged with maintaining at least that level of income. “The money that we make will be gifted back to the mother ship,” Mr. Hall said. “We aim to get more out of it than that.” The Royal Opera will manage Opus Arte at “arm’s length,” he said. Compared with the Royal Opera’s $168 million budget, $593,000 is a tiny sum. About 30 percent of the house’s budget comes from government grants, 40 percent from ticket sales, 20 percent from fund-raising and 10 percent — or $16.8 million — from other commercial ventures like merchandising, catering and hall rentals. and promoting opera broadcasts from other houses, and selling Opus Arte’s back catalog, would be a major part of the DVD company’s activity. “We want to be able to build content from as many other opera houses as we can,” he said. “It’s fundamentally about our content and other people’s content, and how we use that through a whole variety of other media.” Janacek's 'Vixen' Captured On a Cunning Little Disc MUSIC; The Rush to Opera on DVD: Let's Not Get Carried Away RECORDINGS; With DVD's, A Box Seat On the Sofa DVD (Digital Versatile Disk) off Times delivery.

Ferrell as a destitute tenant facing an unlikely landlord in a modest but extremely popular short video. Screens: Mocking Stars and Beer Ads. Yawn. &#147;The Landlord&#148; took 45 minutes to shoot and cost little to produce. It appears on FunnyOrDie.com, where viewers leave their comments. But one afternoon in early March, Mr. Ferrell walked to a guest cottage at his Los Angeles home with a small crew that included Adam McKay, who is his production partner and the director of “Anchorman.” With a camcorder rolling, Mr. Ferrell improvised a sketch as a down-on-his-luck tenant being harassed by a foul-mouthed, booze-sodden landlord. The actor playing the landlord was Mr. McKay’s 2-year-old daughter, Pearl. “The Landlord,” which took 45 minutes to shoot and cost next to nothing to produce, was posted on the new Web site As of yesterday, the sketch had been viewed about 30 million times, and the newly posted outtakes have been watched more than 1.6 million times. (This being Hollywood, have already shot a sequel: “Good Cop, Baby Cop.”) Another punch line of the story, though, is that McKay started the site with the financial backing of Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm that made a name for itself, not to mention billions of dollars, by investing early in YouTube and The Internet, of course, is already filled with cheap laughs — YouTube alone offers a lifetime’s supply of home videos (some funny, most not). But now many experienced comedians, talent agents and financiers are seeing the Web as a way to showcase talent while trying to turn a profit. In January, for example, Turner Broadcasting began , which features videos created by comedy pros and amateurs. And last year, , bought a 51 percent stake in the parent company of for an estimated $20 million. Already, the seven-week-old FunnyOrDie.com, which highlights short videos by veteran comics like Mr. Ferrell as well as videos submitted by amateurs, is in discussions with potential advertisers. The actor and his colleagues have enlisted some famous friends to volunteer their services. , who is married to Chris Henchy, a writer and partner in FunnyOrDie.com, is a playground mom in one short video. And is planning to make a video, too, Mr. McKay said. Clients of Creative Artists Agency, which helped broker the deal with Sequoia, have also made short videos for the site — including the actor and comedian Ed Helms, who created a series of clips called “Zombie American,” and the boxer Oscar De La Hoya In an interview last week at his second-floor office on a side street along Hollywood Boulevard, Mr. Ferrell acknowledged that he had been ambivalent about the site at first. “But then we thought, ‘Maybe this could work,’ ” he said. “We are not putting so much pressure on every piece that it be perfect. Everything isn’t, ‘Oh my God! This has to be so funny.’ It’s amusing, observational. We’re trying not to make it so slick.” The pairing of Hollywood talent and Silicon Valley financiers has all the familiarity of a movie sequel. When the first Internet boom reached its peak in the late 1990s, many actors, writers and directors made the pilgrimage to the headquarters of the venture capital firms along Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., to seek financing to create entertainment for the Internet. Many of those ventures failed, largely because traditional Web shows were expensive to create and the technology at the time made it cumbersome to watch videos online. Among those that faltered were Pop.com, Digital Entertainment Network and Icebox. Another cruel reality is that it is hard to be consistently funny, even with the help of deep pockets. Last summer, for example, Time Inc. closed its Web site, a satirical look at workplace issues, because it did not have a big enough audience. A big change from the late 1990s, though, is that there is now better technology to stream videos, and audiences seem more willing to watch them, leading many investors and Hollywood talent to see a new opportunity. “Our responsibility is to continue to make it better,” said a Sequoia partner, Mark D. Kvamme, referring to FunnyOrDie.com. “If it doesn’t succeed, it is our fault.” The idea for the site started with Mr. Kvamme, who approached Creative Artists in 2006 with his pitch to finance a site for experienced comics. “If you look at all the sites out there, a large portion of them have comedy,” he said, “but it is a mish-mash. There was no place that had a good smattering of professional videos and user-generated content.” Agents at Creative Artists introduced Mr. Kvamme to McKay last year. Then Mr. Kvamme visited the two men on the set of “Blades of Glory” to persuade them to join the new venture. McKay, who had worked together on “Saturday Night Live,” were reluctant at first. “I don’t really know much about the Internet,” Mr. Ferrell said. The reality of having to sit through three weekly meetings and spend hours reviewing videos and writing comments for the site also seemed daunting to them, not to mention a distraction from their more lucrative movie and television careers (the time they are devoting to FunnyOrDie.com is all sweat equity at this point, since they are not being paid). Even so, they came around to seeing the venture as an opportunity to experiment with their own material and to be exposed to ideas from other comics that they could later develop into television shows and movies. Once Mr. Ferrell started making short videos, he enjoyed it. “You get to exercise that same muscle you did at the show,” he said, referring to his days on “Saturday Night Live.” Mr. McKay also came up with the categories that voters use to rate their favorite videos — “immortal” if a video was great, “the crypt” if it was not. And while Mr. McKay and Mr. Ferrell review the 20 most popular videos posted, they also have been careful not to censor the site. When a user posted a video poking fun at , whom they know from “Saturday Night Live,” they briefly took it down, but posted it again because they did not want to set a precedent for banning videos that made fun of their friends.

That image shouted from the cover of tabloid newspapers on Monday as if to herald the umpteenth public wipeout for the 20-year-old actress, who was arrested here Saturday for driving under the influence after she crashed her Mercedes into a tree along the residential strip of Sunset Boulevard. On Monday she checked into a Malibu rehabilitation facility called Promises. And quick as a shot (no, not that kind), all of Hollywood was a-clatter with the sound of clucking tongues over advice not taken. So sad, everyone said, such a waste: so pretty, so talented — so uninsurable. Like too, the spectacle of a young woman’s self-destruction seemed to demand expressions of sympathy along with the requisite scorn. But hard reality was also quickly setting in. Across this close-knit town, decision makers were mentally wiping Ms. Lohan from their short lists. One studio chief who has worked with Ms. Lohan said that he would not hire her until she proved herself healthy and reliable. (Confident at least of this possibility, he would only comment anonymously.) “My hope for her would be that her growing pains get sorted out,” said Valerie Van Galder, president for marketing for Columbia Tristar. “The wild child used to be a phase you grew out of. This feels different. I think now there’s more attention to minutiae, and you’re stalked everywhere you go.” To be hired again, some said, Ms. Lohan might have to be more than sober. She would need perhaps to post her salary as bond, or pay for her own insurance, even on an independent film. Ms. Lohan was meant to start a new movie this week, an independent production titled about two female con artists, also starring . The film’s producers met on Wednesday to decide whether to replace Ms. Lohan or hold off while she spent a month under wraps. Many could say they saw this coming. Ms. Lohan has already worn out her welcome at Disney, where she made four films, including the hits “Parent Trap,” when she was a precocious 11-year-old, and in 2003, in which she played a thoroughly credible middle-aged mom. But by the time she starred in in 2005, she was already a paparazzi fixture, and Disney was worried enough to sit her down for a talking-to. “I told her before the movie began, ‘This is the moment in your career where you either become ,” recalled Nina Jacobson, who ran the studio at the time and is now a producer at DreamWorks. And while filming went fine, Ms. Lohan went missing during the international press junket in Europe. “The image issue aside, professionalism-wise we were disappointed,” Ms. Jacobson said. “And I was sad, because she’s so charismatic and appealing on screen. It’s a very sad thing to see it go to waste this way.” Those in Ms. Lohan’s camp find all this hand wringing to be disingenuous. One person close to Ms. Lohan pointed out that Disney handed the actress a $1 million bonus check for “Freaky Friday,” an invitation for her , then a 16-year-old, to indulge irresponsible impulses. And James G. Robinson, a producer of “Georgia Rule” who had a letter sent to Ms. Lohan at her Chateau Marmont hotel room last year calling her “a spoiled child” for failing to show up for her scheduled call times (the letter was conveniently leaked to the news media even as it was delivered), later invited the actress to be his date to a At Sony the hope was that Ms. Lohan would right herself, and soon. The studio has a thriller starring Ms. Lohan, “I Know Who Killed Me,” out in late July. Ms. Lohan’s publicist, Leslie Sloane-Zelnick, said her client intended to do the publicity for the film, but admitted that things were in limbo. “She will work for that film, she wants to work for that film,” Ms. Sloane-Zelnick said. “But we’re waiting on her situation, in general. At the end of the day, her talent will prevail. Someone will take a chance on her.” (1 of 35) REVIEW; Hey, California Girl, Don't Mess With Grandma FILM REVIEW; The Way We Were, Way Back in June of '68 A Big Star May Not a Profitable Movie Make FILM REVIEW; Altman's Casual Chaos Meets Keillor's Rhubarb-Tinged Nostalgia (1 of 35) &#x00bb; De Gustibus: Don&#8217;t Point That Menu at My Child, Please Basic Training: Modern Marathoners Have Fewer Miles on Them Design That Solves Problems for the World&#8217;s Poor Big Disparities in Judging of Asylum Cases Fighting the Tide, a Few Restaurants Tilt to Tap Water Op-Ed Contributor: Physician, Upgrade Thyself Op-Ed Contributor: Fliers and No Plan B Economix: Go, Eat, You Never Know Fault Harsh Methods in Interrogation Push for Big Subsidies for Coal Process Google Deal Said to Bring U.S. Scrutiny Iraqi Refugees, in Dire Straits, Turn to the Sex Trade in Syria Giuliani Tempers Tough Image on Campaign Justices' Ruling Limits Suits on Pay Disparity Hitherto Staunch G.O.P.

December 2002 the British journalist Mick Brown was driven by ’s chauffeur in Phil Spector’s white Rolls-Royce to Phil Spector’s gloomy castle in Alhambra, Calif., for a spooky interview with Phil Spector, who wore black silk pajamas and made a grand entrance to the strains of Handel. DOWN THE WALL OF SOUND The Rise and Fall of Phil Spector Illustrated. 452 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95. Times Topics: Phil Spector Two months later Lana Clarkson, a tall blond actress who had starred in two “Barbarian Queen” movies and delivered the line “Hi” in “Fast Times at Ridgemont High,” died violently at the same house. The opening chapter of Mr. Brown’s Spector biography insinuates that the visiting interviewer might also have been in peril. But it was Mr. Spector, the tiny, Napoleonic, gun-toting rock ’n’ roll genius who was in jeopardy on that day. Mr. Brown was in the midst of compiling a seriously damning, though not even actively malevolent, set of stories about the Spector life and oeuvre. Grouped together in the bloodcurdling biography they add up to a portrait of pure self-interest and cruelty, tempered only slightly by the great musical achievements of Mr. Spector’s golden age in the early 1960s. This book would feel like a crime story even if its subject were not currently on trial for Ms. Clarkson’s murder. Mr. Brown is not a muckraker. Nor is he really discovering anything new, at least not in the first half of Mr. Spector’s story. As many Spector acquaintances and scorched musical collaborators report, Mr. Spector’s autocratic nature was thought to have obvious sources. There was his father’s suicide (which led to the hit “To Know Him Is to Love Him,” with its title taken from Benjamin Spector’s gravestone). There were an overbearing mother and sister, Bertha and Shirley. There was also the possibility of inbreeding, since this rock maestro had both paternal and maternal grandfathers named George Spector and Phil’s parents were thought to be first cousins. There were the schoolyard bullies whose persecution supposedly explained the adult Phil Spector’s cadre of bodyguards. This first part of after sketchily defining Mr. Spector’s pathology, is mostly devoted to explaining how the famous Wall of Sound was created. For those who know the musical history of this period, which has been expertly documented elsewhere, this part of the book holds little surprise beyond the elaborate skein of creative connections. Mr. Brown underscores the cause-and-effect links between certain recordings, like the Beach Boys’ “Don’t Worry Baby” with Mr. Spector’s production for the Ronettes, “Be My Baby,” or the Four Tops’ “Baby, I Need Your Loving” with the monster, Spector-produced Righteous Brothers hit, “You’ve Lost that Lovin’ Feeling.” He also explains the ubiquitousness of singers like Darlene Love, who might perform under different names at Mr. Spector’s whim and then wind up with nothing to show for it. The consensus expressed in the book is that Mr. Spector habitually betrayed and discarded musicians after he was through with them. “Rather than develop his artists’ careers,” Mr. Brown quotes the Atlantic Records pioneer Jerry Wexler as saying, “Phil developed himself.” But just as the Spector mystique was being hyperbolically immortalized by ’s 1964 magazine article “The First Tycoon of Teen” (which, as Mr. Brown points out, compares Mr. Spector with ), the Spector career hit a ceiling. This book maintains that Mr. Spector, unlike some of the artists he disparages (notably the Beach Boys’ Brian Wilson), began to stall as the world changed around him. “He was like a little boy who does something really cute and gets applauded for that,” says Bruce Johnston, the former Beach Boy, “and so he starts figuring out how to get the applause back, but then it’s not quite as cute again.” At this point the book begins to overflow with not-quite-as-cute effluvia. Borrowing from the sad, lurid memoir of Ronnie Spector, whose career with the Ronettes took a nosedive after she married her producer and disappeared under Mr. Spector’s possessive wing, it describes a lonely household that became a prison. Not for nothing was “Citizen Kane” Mr. Spector’s favorite film at the time. The Manson murders and the disastrous adoptions of three Spector children (later virtually abandoned by their father) only worsened the atmosphere of deterioration. In court testimony it was alleged that Ms. Spector drank to “shut out the continuous stream of shrieking by the respondent.” Said respondent would go on to pay Ms. Spector a court- ordered interim support payment of $1,250 in nickels. Professionally he grew to be “like Sherlock Holmes without a case.” His magisterial “Be My Baby” became background music in an advertisement for Cialis, the erectile dysfunction drug. And his attempted comebacks and collaborations (the most successful of which, in Mr. Brown’s opinion, being ’s “Imagine”) grew ever crazier. He famously aimed a gun at the neck of the singer and declared “Leonard, I love you,” prompting Mr. Cohen to reply drolly “I hope you do, Phil.” Working with Mr. Spector, says someone who attended their collaborative sessions, “gave Leonard a chance to perfect his Shaolin priesthood stuff and become one with the universe.” That was the degree of patience a Spector run-in required. While with a title that perfectly describes its subject’s gift for self-destruction, does find those who appreciated Mr. Spector’s brilliance, humor and occasional wild generosity (“Phil, how can you give a thousand-dollar tip to the waiters but you won’t pay over scale to the musicians?”), it mostly traces an upward trajectory of anger and paranoia, fueled by alcohol and made ever more alarming by the Spector arsenal. Whatever the circumstances surrounding the deadly firing of a gun in Ms. Clarkson’s mouth in the early hours of Feb. 3, 2003, Mr. Spector’s initial response is as telling as anything that may emerge from his trial. He felt annoyed. He felt put upon. He felt misunderstood. And he felt aggrieved. Ms. Clarkson, he said, had had absolutely no right to blow her head off inside his castle.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/technology/31funny.html ANGELES — For , who commands up to $20 million for movies like “Anchorman” and “Blades of Glory,” starring in a short Web video may not seem like the best use of time. Ferrell as a destitute tenant facing an unlikely landlord in a modest but extremely popular short video. Screens: Mocking Stars and Beer Ads. Yawn. &#147;The Landlord&#148; took 45 minutes to shoot and cost little to produce. It appears on FunnyOrDie.com, where viewers leave their comments. But one afternoon in early March, Mr. Ferrell walked to a guest cottage at his Los Angeles home with a small crew that included Adam McKay, who is his production partner and the director of “Anchorman.” With a camcorder rolling, Mr. Ferrell improvised a sketch as a down-on-his-luck tenant being harassed by a foul-mouthed, booze-sodden landlord. The actor playing the landlord was Mr. McKay’s 2-year-old daughter, Pearl. “The Landlord,” which took 45 minutes to shoot and cost next to nothing to produce, was posted on the new Web site As of yesterday, the sketch had been viewed about 30 million times, and the newly posted outtakes have been watched more than 1.6 million times. (This being Hollywood, have already shot a sequel: “Good Cop, Baby Cop.”) Another punch line of the story, though, is that McKay started the site with the financial backing of Sequoia Capital, the Silicon Valley venture capital firm that made a name for itself, not to mention billions of dollars, by investing early in YouTube and The Internet, of course, is already filled with cheap laughs — YouTube alone offers a lifetime’s supply of home videos (some funny, most not). But now many experienced comedians, talent agents and financiers are seeing the Web as a way to showcase talent while trying to turn a profit. In January, for example, Turner Broadcasting began , which features videos created by comedy pros and amateurs. And last year, , bought a 51 percent stake in the parent company of for an estimated $20 million. Already, the seven-week-old FunnyOrDie.com, which highlights short videos by veteran comics like Mr. Ferrell as well as videos submitted by amateurs, is in discussions with potential advertisers. The actor and his colleagues have enlisted some famous friends to volunteer their services. , who is married to Chris Henchy, a writer and partner in FunnyOrDie.com, is a playground mom in one short video. And is planning to make a video, too, Mr. McKay said. Clients of Creative Artists Agency, which helped broker the deal with Sequoia, have also made short videos for the site — including the actor and comedian Ed Helms, who created a series of clips called “Zombie American,” and the boxer Oscar De La Hoya In an interview last week at his second-floor office on a side street along Hollywood Boulevard, Mr. Ferrell acknowledged that he had been ambivalent about the site at first. “But then we thought, ‘Maybe this could work,’ ” he said. “We are not putting so much pressure on every piece that it be perfect. Everything isn’t, ‘Oh my God! This has to be so funny.’ It’s amusing, observational. We’re trying not to make it so slick.” The pairing of Hollywood talent and Silicon Valley financiers has all the familiarity of a movie sequel. When the first Internet boom reached its peak in the late 1990s, many actors, writers and directors made the pilgrimage to the headquarters of the venture capital firms along Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, Calif., to seek financing to create entertainment for the Internet. Many of those ventures failed, largely because traditional Web shows were expensive to create and the technology at the time made it cumbersome to watch videos online. Among those that faltered were Pop.com, Digital Entertainment Network and Icebox. Another cruel reality is that it is hard to be consistently funny, even with the help of deep pockets. Last summer, for example, Time Inc. closed its Web site, a satirical look at workplace issues, because it did not have a big enough audience. A big change from the late 1990s, though, is that there is now better technology to stream videos, and audiences seem more willing to watch them, leading many investors and Hollywood talent to see a new opportunity. “Our responsibility is to continue to make it better,” said a Sequoia partner, Mark D. Kvamme, referring to FunnyOrDie.com. “If it doesn’t succeed, it is our fault.” The idea for the site started with Mr. Kvamme, who approached Creative Artists in 2006 with his pitch to finance a site for experienced comics. “If you look at all the sites out there, a large portion of them have comedy,” he said, “but it is a mish-mash. There was no place that had a good smattering of professional videos and user-generated content.” Agents at Creative Artists introduced Mr. Kvamme to McKay last year. Then Mr. Kvamme visited the two men on the set of “Blades of Glory” to persuade them to join the new venture. McKay, who had worked together on “Saturday Night Live,” were reluctant at first. “I don’t really know much about the Internet,” Mr. Ferrell said. The reality of having to sit through three weekly meetings and spend hours reviewing videos and writing comments for the site also seemed daunting to them, not to mention a distraction from their more lucrative movie and television careers (the time they are devoting to FunnyOrDie.com is all sweat equity at this point, since they are not being paid). Even so, they came around to seeing the venture as an opportunity to experiment with their own material and to be exposed to ideas from other comics that they could later develop into television shows and movies. Once Mr. Ferrell started making short videos, he enjoyed it. “You get to exercise that same muscle you did at the show,” he said, referring to his days on “Saturday Night Live.” Mr. McKay also came up with the categories that voters use to rate their favorite videos — “immortal” if a video was great, “the crypt” if it was not. And while Mr. McKay and Mr. Ferrell review the 20 most popular videos posted, they also have been careful not to censor the site. When a user posted a video poking fun at , whom they know from “Saturday Night Live,” they briefly took it down, but posted it again because they did not want to set a precedent for banning videos that made fun of their friends.
