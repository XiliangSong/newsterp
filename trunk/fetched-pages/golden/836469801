It turns out the problem was closer to home, too. Yesterday, federal officials announced that a manufacturing plant in was using the same banned substance, melamine, to make binding agents that ended up in feed for farmed fish, shrimp and livestock. The problem surfaced after a distributor, concerned about what was in its feed binders after the reports from China, sent the product to a private laboratory for testing. The melamine was used by BTLSR, a Canadian forest products company with a small chemical plant in Toledo, to make binding agents that keep pellets of animal feed together, said Dr. David Acheson, assistant commissioner for food protection at the Food and Drug Administration Melamine is not permitted in food or pet food products. In the last few months, pet food contaminated with melamine, all traced back to China, sickened or killed thousands of pets Acheson said the levels of melamine and melamine-related compounds in Tembec&#8217;s products were far lower than that found in wheat flour from China that ended up killing the pets. Consequently, the authorities said that they thought the contamination did not appear to pose a risk to human health. Nevertheless, the F.D.A. issued a voluntary recall of finished feed made with two binding agents: Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II, which are made by Tembec and used in fish and shrimp feed. A third product, Xtra-Bond, which is made by a Colorado firm called Uniscope using Tembec ingredients, was not recalled because the levels of melamine were low. Uniscope is the distributor of all three products. Aquabond and Aqua-Tec II are sold mostly overseas; Xtra-Bond is sold domestically. Agency officials are alerting the foreign governments that received the products, Dr. Acheson said. The investigation began on May 18 when Uniscope alerted the agency that it had discovered melamine in the testing. Dr. Acheson said that the investigation was in its early stages and that some questions remained unanswered, like how long Tembec had used melamine in its products and the extent of the contamination. &#8220;What Tembec knew, didn&#8217;t know, what their activities were, is part of the investigation,&#8221; Dr. Acheson said, Earlier, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to believe that a manufacturer of pet food would not know about this.&#8221; Federal officials would not say whether they would pursue criminal charges in the Tembec case. They said that they had already been contacting domestic manufacturers to make sure they were aware of the sources of their ingredients. John Valley, Tembec&#8217;s executive vice president for business development and corporate affairs, said his company thought that Uniscope was shipping the binders overseas for use as shrimp feed. Once the F.D.A. told it that the binders were being used domestically, Tembec stopped making them from melamine, Mr. Valley said. Tembec makes resins and certain chemicals for industrial uses, including melamine. Mr. Valley said Uniscope was the only customer that used its products for animal feed. Asked why it was all right to use melamine in feed for shrimp overseas but not he said: &#8220;Melamine has just really had a focus that&#8217;s come upon it. A lot of companies and agencies are reviewing certain applications of melamine.&#8221; The pet food scandal has led to increased scrutiny of all food imports, particularly those from China, and threatened trade relations. Some members of Congress have demanded tougher inspections of food imports from China. &#8220;This recent incident goes to show that we apparently have some bad actors out there,&#8221; said Michael Doyle, director of the Center for Food Safety at the . &#8220;It can happen But Mr. Doyle pointed out that the incidence of food illness remains relatively rare problem with the Tembec binders surfaced after Uniscope, a company based in Johnstown, Colo., decided to test the binders. &#8220;They just asked themselves, &#8216;I wonder what&#8217;s in this stuff?

Skip to next paragraph Dr. Martin S. Cetron in Atlanta Wednesday. Back Story With The Times&#146;s Anahad O’Connor ( TB Patient Is Isolated After Taking Two Flights The man is being detained under a federal isolation order in an Atlanta hospital for treatment of extremely resistant tuberculosis, which is often lethal. American officials and those in many other countries, meanwhile, are seeking to advise more than 100 passengers who sat closest to him on the longest flights and crew members to be tested for the infection. Health officials are also offering testing to hundreds of other passengers on the flights. It was the first airline-contact tracing investigation for extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis, and it exposed many flaws that need to be fixed for future episodes, officials of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in Atlanta. While many infectious-disease experts and ethicists supported the agency’s action, at least one strongly criticized it as over-reacting. Among the problems the agency identified were dealing with time zone differences; a lack of coordination between American and international authorities concerning how to medically isolate the man while he was abroad; and how to speed the retrieval of passenger manifests from airlines. The episode also raised questions about how rapidly health officials could respond to a similar emergency with other deadly infectious diseases. Even after the news conference, many other questions remained unanswered, including why it took health officials in Georgia so long to try to deliver a letter that explicitly told the man, whose identity was not disclosed, not to fly abroad for his honeymoon. In an interview published yesterday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, the man disputed statements from disease agency officials about warnings it said Fulton County officials gave him about flying abroad. The agency said he was told not to fly. The man told the paper that said they “preferred” that he not go abroad for his honeymoon and did not advise him to take any precautions. “There are different perspectives on who said what to whom when,” said Dr. Martin S. Cetron, who directs agency’s division of global migration and quarantine. “It is very unfortunate that this whole situation wasn’t prevented” before the man flew with 432 other passengers and 18 crew members to Paris from Atlanta on Air France 385 on May 12, Dr. Cetron said. He took at least five flights within Europe and then flew with 190 other passengers and nine crew members from Prague to Montreal on Czech Air 104 on May 25. The in Atlanta met with the man and his family on May 10, two days before he flew to Paris, and told them that he should not travel because he had multi-resistant tuberculosis, the disease agency said. No legal order was issued at the time, Dr. Cetron said in referring further questions to the Calls to the yesterday were not returned. The extraordinary dangerous form of the tuberculosis was not detected until May 22, while he was in Europe. Dr. Cetron said that an agency officer telephoned the man in Rome and explicitly told him not to fly on a commercial plane — doctors believe prolonged exposure is needed to spread tuberculosis — while the agency worked out options to bring him back to included an air ambulance. By the time a former disease agency doctor, who is working in Rome, arrived at the man’s hotel, the couple had left, Dr. Cetron said. The agency was in the process of putting the man’s name on a no-fly list. But by this time he had cut short his honeymoon that was supposed to last into June and was landing in Montreal. The efforts “weren’t fast enough,” Dr. Cetron said, adding that “we certainly will be learning lessons and looking to improve” current systems. The man drove to the United States and somewhere between Albany and New York spoke with Dr. Cetron, who instructed him on how to continue to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan. There, he was isolated for 72 hours until the disease agency flew him in its plane to Atlanta on Monday. The man told the Atlanta paper that tuberculosis was detected by accident when he had a chest X-ray in January for another undisclosed problem.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/health/31aids.html W.H.O. Seeks More AIDS Tests in Nations at Epidemic&#8217;s Center Health & Behavior W.H.O. Seeks More AIDS Tests in Nations at Epidemic’s Center May 30 &#151; The on Wednesday advised health workers in countries hard hit by to urge every patient to be tested for H.I.V. rather than to simply offer tests in limited circumstances. That is a more aggressive approach than what is commonly taken now or has previously been approved by the health organization. Until now, the W.H.O. and the AIDS agency had advised health workers in areas where H.I.V. is prevalent to offer tests if treatment is available, but not to recommend a test to every patient. Quite often, health workers administer a test only if the patient actively seeks one. The shift in strategy is born out of a stark reality, officials said: two decades into the AIDS epidemic, about four out of five people who are infected in low- to middle-income nations do not know that they carry H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. In sub-Saharan Africa, where the epidemic is centered, nearly 20 million people do not know they are infected, officials estimate. Their ignorance is costly. Those who do not know they are infected are more likely to infect others and less likely to seek early treatment, experts said. That means it costs more and takes more effort to save them with antiretroviral drugs. To curb the epidemic&#8217;s spread, &#8220;an H.I.V. diagnosis is an essential first step,&#8221; Kevin De Cock, head of the H.I.V.-AIDS division of the health organization, said during a telephone news conference. Evidence of the value of routine H.I.V. testing in nations swept by AIDS has been mounting for at least three years. In January 2004, Botswana&#8217;s government ordered its health care workers to recommend an H.I.V. test to every patient who showed up at a clinic or hospital, regardless of why he or she sought treatment. Testing rates skyrocketed. Zambia, Malawi, Kenya and Uganda now have similar policies. &#8220;The Botswana experience taught us that people want to be cared for, that they would like medical intervention&#8221; said Dr. Ernest Darkoh, who ran Botswana&#8217;s AIDS treatment program in 2004. Many patients were actually relieved when a health care worker urged them to take an H.I.V. test, he said, because it lifted some of the burden of a scary decision. Still, some human rights advocates have argued that because of the stigma of AIDS, no one should be pushed to take a test that could lead to the loss of their employment or abandonment by their families. Wednesday&#8217;s announcement, some AIDS experts said, strikes a balance between individual rights and the demands of a public health emergency. While tests must continue to be voluntary and confidential, they said, health care workers must advocate them as a standard part of medical care in countries with pervasive epidemics. &#8220;I believe these guidelines are long, long overdue and require rapid implementation,&#8221; said Zachie Achmat, a leading AIDS activist in South Africa. &#8220;It would be entirely substandard medical practice not to recommend that any person in a high-burden country be tested for H.I.V.&#8221; While health organizations and United Nations AIDS program have been stressing the importance of widespread H.I.V. testing for years, Dr. De Cock said earlier guidelines were too ambiguous. &#8220;You could legitimately ask, &#8216;Have we used H.I.V. testing in the most imaginative and beneficial way?&#8217; &#8221; he said. &#8220;I think we feel that, somehow, let&#8217;s get serious and do this right.&#8221; The new guidelines state that unless the patient specifically refuses one, an H.I.V. test should be performed if the patient&#8217;s symptoms or medical histories suggest infection. That would include the children of infected mothers and anyone with . More broadly, the guidelines state that in any nation where more than one percent of pregnant women have H.I.V., every patient who shows up at a clinic or hospital should be tested, regardless of symptoms. That would cover a swath of sub-Saharan African countries. Dr. De Cock said that the cost of expanding testing is minor compared with the overall cost of AIDS prevention and treatment. But he said that the new policy would likely depend on hiring and training more low-level health care workers because there are far too few doctors or nurses in low-income countries to handle the task.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/washington/31prexy.html Bush Requests $30 Billion to Fight AIDS Requests $30 Billion to Fight AIDS May 30 — President Bush called Wednesday for Congress to spend $30 billion to fight global over the next five years, a near doubling of financing that is part of a White House effort to burnish Mr. Bush’s humanitarian credentials before he meets leaders of the industrialized nations next week. Skip to next paragraph Doug Mills/The Bush with Baron Mosima Loyiso Tantoh, 4, and his mother, Manyongo Mosima Tantoh, who is H.I.V. positive. Bush's Proposal for AIDS Program W.H.O. Seeks More AIDS Tests in Nations at Epidemic’s Center The initiative, if approved, would build on a program that grew out of the president’s 2003 State of the Union address, when he asked for $15 billion over five years for prevention, treatment and care of AIDS patients in developing countries. Congress approved more than $18 billion, but the program is set to expire next year. Mr. Bush’s announcement, delivered in the White House Rose Garden, adds to what has become an unexpectedly high priority for the White House. AIDS was not a signature issue for Mr. Bush when he ran for office in 2000. But it has become one in part because the Christian conservatives who make up his political base have embraced it, and in part because Mr. Bush wants to build a legacy for the United States and a more compassionate image abroad to counter international criticism of American policies in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. That sentiment was reflected in Mr. Bush’s remarks on Wednesday. “Once again, the generosity of the American people is one of the great untold stories of our time,” he said. “Our citizens are offering comfort to millions who suffer, and restoring hope to those who feel forsaken.” AIDS advocacy organizations praised Mr. Bush for proposing the additional money, but said the plan — which he said would provide drugs for 2.5 million patients — did not go nearly far enough toward meeting the international community’s stated goal of treating the estimated 10 million patients in developing nations. “It’s a modest increase, it’s important that he reaffirmed it, but we will need the next president to do more,” said Paul Zeitz, executive director of the Global AIDS Alliance, a nonprofit advocacy group. “We’re not getting ahead of the AIDS crisis. We’re tempering it.” Administration officials concede that point and say the White House is hoping Mr. Bush’s announcement will prod other Group of 8 countries, as well as nations that have growing economies, to make spending commitments of their own. “The goal of universal access isn’t a United States goal, it’s a global goal,” said Mark R. Dybul, the administration’s global AIDS coordinator. “The rest of the world is going to need to respond if we are going to achieve these goals.” International development and human rights issues will be high on the agenda of next week’s summit, but so will — an issue on which Mr. Bush finds himself at odds with his fellow Group of 8 leaders, notably the meeting’s host, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany. Dan Bartlett, counselor to Mr. Bush, said the president intended to address climate change in a speech on Thursday at the United States Agency for International Development. But so far this week, Mr. Bush has been devoting most of his attention to human rights and poverty, issues that draw him less criticism than his stance on climate change. In an interview Monday night, a senior administration official said Mr. Bush planned to spend the week in advance of the Group of 8 conference spotlighting humanitarian issues and “demonstrating U.S. leadership around the world.” On Tuesday, Mr. Bush announced he was imposing stiff economic sanctions on Sudan to press its government into cooperating with a peacekeeping force that is trying to end the violence in Darfur. On Wednesday, in addition to the AIDS announcement, Mr. Bush named , his former trade representative, as his candidate to head the , calling the nominee “a committed internationalist” who “wants to help struggling nations defeat poverty.” In Thursday’s speech, Mr. Bush also intends to talk about education programs in the developing world, and his initiative to combat The AIDS initiative, which is likely to generate bipartisan support in Congress, would cover federal spending for the 2009 to 2013 fiscal years, meaning the vast majority of the money would be spent after Mr. Bush left office. To promote it, the White House is sending to Africa next month. “She and I share a passion,” Mr. Bush said. “We believe that to whom much is given, much is required.” The United Nations reports that there are nearly 40 million people worldwide living with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS; last year three million died from their infections. In his announcement in 2003, Mr. Bush said he was committed to offering treatment for two million H.I.V. patients by 2008. But so far, he said, the program, called the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, has paid for treatment for just 1.1 million people in 15 nations. Advocates complain that the new goal, bringing the number of patients treated to 2.5 million, is not that much more ambitious than the old one. “By 2013 there will be 12 million people that urgently need medicines,” Mr. Zeitz said. The White House, however, said that in addition to providing treatment for 2.5 million, the new money would prevent 12 million new infections and provide care for more than 12 million people. Mr. Bartlett said the president was convinced America’s image in the world would improve because of it. “I’ve heard him talk about this is a part of America that gets overlooked,” he said, “and that over time, people will look back and say, ‘At a point in time where America may have been under scrutiny for other reasons, look at the significant contribution they have made. They saved more lives than anybody could have imagined.’ ” Finds Bush's AIDS Effort Limited by Restrictions Circumcision's Anti-AIDS Effect Found Greater Than First Thought Bush Gets Aid Of Democrats In Fighting Pandemics Cheap Solutions Cut AIDS Toll for Poor Kenyan Youths Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Third World and Developing Countries &#x00bb;

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/31/washington/31fda.html F.D.A. Still Unsettled in Wake of New Questions Still Unsettled in Wake of New Questions Md., May 30 &#151; When Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach took over the Food and Drug Administration in 2005, the agency had a crisis over drug approvals that had missed or ignored dangerous side effects in Vioxx, antidepressants and other prominent medications. Dr. von Eschenbach promised improvements, and agency officials said they would no longer be caught flatfooted on drug safety. But this month, The New England Journal of Medicine published a study suggesting that a major pill, Avandia, might increase the risk of heart attacks. Concerns over that drug and others have led and Democrats in the House and the Senate to call for investigations. A House hearing is planned for June 6. Dr. von Eschenbach said in a briefing on Wednesday that his agency needed to collaborate more closely with drug companies. &#8220;The point is that we need to look at the role of the F.D.A. in being a bridge to the future, not a barrier to the future,&#8221; he said at his office here. Responding to a suggestion that promoting collaborations with drug makers, including an effort to modernize human testing and find genetic markers to predict suffering from side effects, may not be politic, Dr. von Eschenbach said the agency was not working solely with pharmaceutical companies. &#8220;It&#8217;s with everyone,&#8221; including government agencies and independent scientists, he said. He defended the agency in the Avandia case, saying, &#8220;I believe we did it right with regard to Avandia.&#8221; Hints of the heart risks from Avandia were, however, present from the beginning. The original trials, overseen by , the drug&#8217;s maker, showed that patients taking the drug had more than twice the rate of ischemic as recipients of placebos. The medical reviewer for the F.D.A. expressed concerns, but in a further analysis decided that it was less of a problem. The hearing next week may highlight the growing internal dissension between officials who approve drugs and those who track the safety of drugs after they have been approval. Tension between the groups has long been common, but in recent months it has erupted into sniping. Congressional investigators said the safety group recommended months ago that the drug agency put its severest warning on Avandia. The review group, which holds sway, has not done so. The sniping became public in an exchange at an advisory committee hearing last month on whether to approve a new On one side was Dr. David Graham, author of an internal report that found that Avandia substantially increased the risks of heart attack, findings similar to the medical journal&#8217;s report. On the other, Dr. Robert J. Meyer, an office director in the drug review division, and his boss, Dr. John Jenkins, were in a group deciding against warning about the potential risks. There was little chance that the advisory committee or the drug agency would approve the arthritis drug, Arcoxia, at the hearing. Behind the scenes, agency officials were battling over Avandia. Dr. Graham told the committee that top agency officials had demanded an unreasonable level of certainty about a drug&#8217;s risks before agreeing to warn the public. &#8220;They assume it&#8217;s safe,&#8221; Dr. Graham said of the top officials&#8217; analyses of safety data. &#8220;Which is just looking at things all the way wrong.&#8221; Dr. Jenkins said Dr. Graham&#8217;s &#8220;characterization of how we look at safety data is simply false.&#8221; &#8220;We make our best informed judgment about what the regulatory action should be,&#8221; Dr. Jenkins added. , Republican of Iowa, and others on Capitol Hill, say the rift between the approval office and the safety office means that the two must separate and that the safety group must have more power. Mr. Grassley proposed such a split in an amendment this month; it failed by one vote. Top House staff members said the Avandia case had breathed new life into Mr. Grassley&#8217;s proposal, because the House will soon debate changing the drug agency. Curt Furberg, a professor of public health sciences at Wake Forest and a co-author of the New England Journal of Medicine&#8217;s editorial on Avandia, said the agency remained broken. &#8220;Safety is just not a high priority for them,&#8221; said Dr. Furberg, who serves on the F.D.A. Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee. Dr. von Eschenbach said the agency intended to warn patients rapidly when it received information that a drug might be unsafe. He added that the agency had to find a way to ensure that patients did not overreact to uncertain safety problems. Says F.D.A.

But many triathletes and runners prefer to eat their carbohydrates (like chewy bars) instead of gulping Gatorade or Cytomax, carb-loaded drinks with a hint of electrolytes.
