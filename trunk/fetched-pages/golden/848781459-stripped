http://www.komotv.com/news/boeing/7158356.html Machinists authorize strike at St. Louis Boeing plants authorize strike at St. Louis Boeing plants Story Published: Apr 23, 2007 at 4:44 PM 23, 2007 at 4:44 PM PDT ST. LOUIS (AP) - Nearly 2,600 workers at Boeing Co. plants in suburban St. Louis could walk off the job as early as next month if negotiations between the company and the Machinists union fall through. Members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 837 voted 1,167-38 Sunday to authorize a strike if a deal for a new contract isn't reached by the time the current contract expires May 20. Detailed contract negotiations begin next week. The company has yet to present the union with its economic package, including its pay proposal. But machinists are already upset with some key components of the contract, most notably seniority rights. "We had a pretty fired-up crowd yesterday," said Tom Pinski, a spokesman for the machinists. "The union sees this as the gutting of the seniority rights of membership." Boeing spokesman Forrest Gossett declined to comment on any specific aspects of the contract negotiations. He said company officials "look forward to vigorous discussions. And we expect to reach a successful conclusion." Machinists at Boeing plants in St. Louis County and St. Charles County are part of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems, making everything from fighter jets like the F-18 Super Hornet and F-15 Eagle to missiles and component parts. Pinski said rising health care costs are a concern among the workers. Boeing also is considering job classification changes that have some workers upset. But the biggest issue, Pinski said, is seniority rights. Pinski said the company wants to exempt less-experienced workers from layoffs if they have skills deemed essential to production. The machinists want layoffs based strictly on seniority. "They see it as a definite attack on the seniority rights we've had here basically since 1941 when they organized the old McDonnell Aircraft Company," Pinski said. Boeing purchased its former rival McDonnell Douglas in 1997. That was a year after the most recent strike at the facilities. Machinists walked off the job for 99 days in 1996. Pinski said workers will vote May 20 on the company's contract proposal. If it is rejected, another vote will take place immediately to consider a strike. The strike vote would need two-thirds majority. If the strike vote is approved, the company would be given a minimum of seven days' notice before an actual walkout occurred. "In today's environment, it's more like, if we're going to do it, let's get it done," Pinski said.

Story Published: May 9, 2007 at 10:54 9, 2007 at 11:09 AM PDT RENTON, Wash. (AP) - Boeing has sent an investigator and a technical specialist to Cameroon to assist the team looking for the cause of the Kenya Airways crash. Spokeswoman Liz Verdier says Boeing also will be interested in the information from the flight data recorder. It has 1,000 parameters, or readings, on the condition of the plane such as air speed and engine performance. The plane went down Saturday in a swamp about three miles from the end of the runway, killing all 114 people on board. The 737-800 was only six months old and had about 500 flights. Verdier says the only other 737-800 crash was the Gol airliner that crashed in Brazil last September after a mid-air collision. The crash was blamed on air traffic control error. The 800 is the most popular of next-generation 737s. About 1,200 of the planes have been produced since 1998. Verdier said Boeing has made 2,251 of the next-generation 737s.
http://www.komotv.com/news/boeing/7205701.html Boeing announces 4 more orders announces 4 more orders Story Published: Apr 26, 2007 at 11:30 26, 2007 at 3:55 PM PDT SEATTLE (AP) - Boeing Co. has received orders for 33 planes from three airlines and an investment firm worth about $4.3 billion, the aerospace company and its customers announced Thursday. Boeing has enjoyed a spate of orders this week, tallying 95 firm aircraft orders, plus 38 options and purchase rights, since Monday. Boeing said New Delhi-based SpiceJet ordered 10 of the short to medium-range 737-800s, valued at more than $700 million at list prices. Airlines typically negotiate discounts to the list price. SpiceJet previously ordered 20 of the 737s. "These aircraft are enabling us to add capacity on new and existing routes, and will continue to support SpiceJet's mission of being India's preferred low-cost airline," said Bhulo Kansagra, a director on SpiceJet's board. Boeing also said Oak Hill Capital Partners, a private equity firm, ordered six Boeing 777 freighters, valued at about $1.4 billion at list prices. Russia's S7 Airlines, formerly Sibir, said it ordered 10 of Boeing's 737-800s to expand its charter fleet. The company also said it has rights to purchase 10 more. The planes have a catalog price of about $700 million. "This large contract with Boeing is a major event for us and allows us to look with optimism at resolving one of S7's most important tasks - creating a new, modern fleet in the next seven years," company general director Vladislav Filyov said in a statement. Later Thursday, Boeing and Arik Air announced that the Nigerian carrier had ordered seven planes: three midsize 787-9 jets, two long-range 777-200 LRs and two extended-range 777-300 ERs. The planes are worth roughly $1.5 billion at list prices, and were previously listed as orders from an unidentified customer on Boeing's Web site. Boeing and Arik Air made the announcement as the airline took delivery of two new 737s. Boeing also said an unidentified customer this week had ordered four 737s.
http://www.komotv.com/news/boeing/7261311.html Boeing CEO: Company will overtake Airbus CEO: Company will overtake Airbus Jim McNerney, Boeing CEO (File photo) Story Published: Apr 30, 2007 at 2:48 PM 30, 2007 at 2:48 PM PDT CHICAGO (AP) - Boeing Co. Chief Executive Jim McNerney said Monday the aerospace company "turned the corner" in 2006 and is on pace to overtake rival Airbus as the world's largest commercial airplane maker within a year. McNerney spoke at the company's annual shareholders meeting at a time when Boeing is enjoying almost unparalleled success in its commercial aircraft and defense businesses and distancing itself from the scandals of recent years. After posting a 2006 profit of $2.2 billion amid a 15 percent jump in revenue to $61 billion, the Chicago-based company last week beat Wall Street's projections with a 27 percent increase in first-quarter earnings and 8 percent higher sales. Much of its momentum is due to a flood of orders for the more fuel-efficient new 787. The first 787 is scheduled to be unveiled on July 8 - the calendar equivalent of 7-8-7 - with the initial test flight planned in late summer. The annual meeting was noteworthy for being largely devoid of the troublesome issues that have dogged the company in recent years, such as ethics scandals and CEO turnover. Boeing helped hasten the end of the ethics clamor by agreeing to pay the government a record $615 million following a three-year investigation into its defense contracting practices. McNerney told shareholders that last year was "a year in which we turned the corner and positioned ourselves for a very exciting future." He said 2007 is "off to a good clean start." Boeing surpassed Airbus in plane orders in 2006, but the European company delivered more aircraft and held its position as the world's top airplane manufacturer. Asked in a media session afterward when Boeing would reclaim the No. 1 spot, McNerney said: "The math would say end of this year, beginning of next." But he declined an opportunity to take a potshot at the rival airplane maker, whose lengthy delays with its superjumbo A380 sent many orders to Boeing instead. "They have gone through some difficulties the last couple of years, but we've had times in our history where we've run into difficulties. I'm convinced they'll get through them and they're going to be the formidable competitor they've been over the last couple of decades," McNerney said. "I don't exult in their difficulties at all," he said. Boeing shares, which increased 26 percent in 2006, fell $1.02 to close at $93 on the New York Stock Exchange. They reached an all-time high of $95.58 last Thursday.
http://www.komotv.com/news/boeing/7157591.html Japanese factories working to meet 787 demand factories working to meet 787 demand Workers work on a portion of a fuselage of Boeing 787 at Kawasaki Heavy Industries' factory in Nagoya, central Japan Monday, April 23, 2007. Story Published: Apr 23, 2007 at 4:01 PM 23, 2007 at 4:01 PM PDT NAGOYA, Japan (AP) - The factories of Boeing Co.'s Japanese partners are bustling with workers these days putting finishing touches on towering parts of aircraft to meet the surging demand for the 787 passenger jet. Boeing's new fuel-efficient 787 is a big hit, having already collected 544 orders. It is scheduled to make its first flight in August and to enter commercial service next year. At the plants of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Fuji Heavy Industries, shown to reporters Monday, the parts were being cooked in massive ovens called autoclaves, where heat and pressure were applied to shape the wing parts or fuselage, the body of the jet. What makes the 787 unique is that such parts are made of carbon-fiber composites, which are lighter than the metal previously used for commercial aircraft, making the 787 more fuel-efficient and resistant to corrosion. Boeing Vice President Robert Noble said the 787 project remains on schedule, as adjustments are made for the minor delays that have come up. The partnerships with the Japanese suppliers, which date back to previous planes, have helped Boeing greatly in investment, technology and manufacturing efficiency with the 787, he said. "We're very pleased with where we are at the moment," he said during the tour. "This is just the beginning of working in this way. I couldn't dream of Boeing taking on an airplane by itself again." By dividing up the responsibilities among the suppliers, they have been able to focus on each part in perfecting the production, Noble said. The Japanese manufacturers have collaborated on the design and are contributing about 35 percent of the parts of the 787, including a main fuselage part and wing box, the most they have ever contributed to a Boeing plane. The 787 has greatly helped Boeing in its competition against rival Airbus SAS, which has run into costly production delays with its A380, the world's biggest passenger jet, scheduled for delivery later this year. At the Japanese plants, once the composite parts are shaped, properly trimmed, holes carved for doors and windows in the fuselage, and grid-like parts placed on the wings, they are shipped on a barge from a nearby port to the airport. The parts from Japan are flown to Boeing's assembly plant in Everett, Wash. Such parts for previous planes were sent by ship, taking weeks, but now the parts only require 10 hours to ship, Noble said. Japanese company officials said they expected Boeing orders to keep growing, and they were increasing the number of employees and offering more training to be prepared to boost production. Akira Taniguchi of Kawasaki Heavy said the plant can produce parts for about seven 787 jets a month, but may boost that capacity in the future. The biggest challenge was to meet the quality demands of Boeing, and do it quickly, officials said. "We're all geared up now in the final stage of production," said Takashi Fujimoto, overseeing the 787 program at Mitsubishi Heavy.

Story Published: Apr 24, 2007 at 7:53 24, 2007 at 7:53 AM PDT SEATTLE - Air Canada says it has exercised options and purchase rights to order 23 Boeing 787s. At average list prices the order would be worth about $3.7 billion. Air Canada now has 37 of the new mid-size widebody planes on order and says it's the largest North American customer for the new plane Boeing is rolling out this summer at the Everett factory. The Montreal-based airline is taking options for 32 more of the planes, but reducing a previous order for Boeing 777s by two planes. Air Canada says it will use the new 787s to replace Boeing 767s and Airbus planes in its fleet.
http://www.komotv.com/news/boeing/7167611.html Virgin orders 787s, teams with Boeing on biofuel orders 787s, teams with Boeing on biofuel Story Published: Apr 24, 2007 at 8:37 24, 2007 at 10:20 AM PDT CHICAGO (AP) - Boeing Co. announced Tuesday that Virgin Atlantic ordered 15 of its 787 Dreamliners and said it is partnering with the London-based carrier to develop a new biofuel for commercial jets as part of efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The 787 order, which Boeing previously disclosed but did not identify as coming from Virgin, is worth $2.8 billion at list prices. It is the largest European order to date for the Dreamliner, which is due to enter service in 2008. Virgin also took options for eight 787s and purchase rights for 20 more of the aircraft, which Boeing is touting for its increased fuel efficiency - a deal potentially worth $8 billion. The 787-9 burns around 27 percent less fuel per passenger than the Airbus A340-300 aircraft it will replace, thanks to its partial use of lightweight composite materials instead of metal. The planes will be added to Virgin's fleet beginning in 2011, officials said. Boeing executives and Virgin Atlantic Chairman Richard Branson announced the orders and the partnership at a news conference. They said they hope to launch a test flight of a biofuel-powered 747 in the next year. Officials at both companies declined to comment on the value of their investment in the biofuel project, which follows a similar airline industry initiative. "We look forward to finding and testing alternative fuels and developing and implementing solutions that will reduce emissions both in the air and on the ground," said Boeing CEO Jim McNerney. "This is important work with high objectives." It could take at least five years before any jet biofuel is widely available for commercial flights. Branson said he hopes the new fuel will reduce the overall pollution generated by the airline industry, which is responsible for about 2 percent of the world's carbon emissions. "We all have a responsibility whether as airline owners, airline manufacturers, or engine makers to reduce that carbon footprint, which has grown over the years," he said. "Doing nothing should not be an option." Separately, Air Canada said it is increasing its Dreamliner order to 37 from 14, making it the largest North American customer for the plane. The revised agreement includes options for 23 more 787s. The new aircraft will replace its existing Airbus A340s and A330s and Boeing 767s. Those planes are scheduled to be delivered in 2010. Boeing shares rose 24 cents to $93.88 in late-morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after reaching their latest all-time high of $94.96.

Copa already operates two dozen of the single-aisle, twin-engine 737-800s, and is awaiting delivery of 10 more with Wednesday's order.
http://www.komotv.com/news/boeing/7184336.html Boeing earnings climb 27 percent in first quarter earnings climb 27 percent in first quarter A Boeing 747 Dreamlifter, carrying the first major assembly for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, arrives Tuesday, April 24, 2007, in Everett. Story Published: Apr 25, 2007 at 7:55 25, 2007 at 7:41 PM PDT CHICAGO (AP) - Boeing Co. put more pressure on its European rival Airbus Wednesday in the dogfight for the slot as the world's No. 1 airplane maker. Boeing reported a 27 percent boost in first-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street projections, while its backlog surged to another record level. Meanwhile, its revenue grew 8 percent. "Boeing is gaining market share and doing it very profitably. That's a tough competitor," said Richard Aboulafia, an airline analyst with Teal Group. "Usually, it's a choice: market share or profit. To be able to do both at this rate is a serious threat for Airbus." Earlier this year, Boeing surpassed Airbus in plane orders, but the European company delivered more aircraft and held its position as the world's top airplane manufacturer. Boeing is expected to outpace Airbus' deliveries next year. "We are off to a good start in 2007," said President and Chief Executive Jim McNerney. "Our record backlog, increasing productivity, and the progress of our development programs have us on track to achieve our growth and productivity objectives." Chicago-based Boeing earned $877 million, or $1.13 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with $692 million, or 88 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue climbed 8 percent to $15.4 billion, beating Wall Street expectations. During the year-ago period, Boeing had revenue of $14.3 billion. On average, analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial forecast earnings per share of $1.01 on revenue of $15.02 billion. The company said its backlog climbed 23 percent to a new record - $262 billion - thanks to strong commercial plane and defense orders. Boeing has bet its more fuel-efficient Dreamliner will win more of the lucrative market for long-range, midsized planes than the Airbus A350. Boeing's plane is expected to begin service in May 2008, while its first flight is targeted for late August. Meanwhile, Airbus continues to struggle with its superjumbo A380, the world's biggest passenger airplane, which has been beset by two-year delays that have prompted customers to cancel their orders for cargo-versions of the plane. "Because the markets and our customers are accepting our technology, the backlog represents to all of us at Boeing both a huge opportunity and a big burden to get it done properly," McNerney said. The company's commercial airplane division delivered 106 planes as its revenue climbed 7 percent to $7.6 billion. The unit's operating profit remained largely flat at $706 million, compared with $703 million last year. "There's no denying that this continuing flow of airplane orders is impressive to say the least," said Morningstar analyst Chris Lozier. Boeing's integrated defense systems division saw its revenue climb 7 percent from the year-ago period, while its operating profit slipped 4 percent to $784 million. Boeing reaffirmed its previous 2007 guidance, saying it expected to have revenue between $64.5 billion and $65 billion, while earning between $4.55 and 4.75 per share. In 2008, the company said it expects to have revenue between $71 billion and $72 billion, while earning between $5.55 and $5.75 per share. Financial analysts called the company's performance mixed, even though results surpassed Wall Street forecasts. "Some investors may be disappointed that guidance, which remains well below consensus expectations, did not improve," JPMorgan analyst Joseph B. Nadol III wrote in a research note. Analysts are expecting earnings per share of $4.70 to $5.00 in 2007 and $5.61 to $6.80 in 2008. Others were troubled by narrower profit margins within the commercial plane and defense segments. During the quarter, Boeing said it repurchased about 44 million shares worth $360 million. Boeing also said it expects to spend up to $3.4 billion on research and development this year. The development of company's 787 Dreamliner continues to progress on time, officials said. The company has received more than 544 firm orders for the plane, officials said. Airbus has been beset by management and financial problems, including the delay to the A380 that has wiped out billions in forecast profits. "We are working weight, schedule, and supplier challenges as we strive to meet our milestones," McNerney said. "Mindful of the inherent challenges and risks that lie ahead, particularly in the latter stages of major airplane development programs, we are nonetheless pleased with the progress we're making on the 787." Boeing shares climbed $1.02, or 1.1 percent, to close at $94.69 in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
