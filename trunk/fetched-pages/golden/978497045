http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7746867.html Ford predicts rise in retail sales predicts rise in retail sales AM PDT DETROIT (AP) - A Ford Motor Co. official predicts that his company's overall U.S. sales will drop in May, but its retail sales to individual buyers will show a year-over-year monthly increase for the first time since October of 2006. George Pipas, Ford's top sales analyst, told reporters Tuesday that the increase, which includes only the Ford, Lincoln and Mercury brands, would be fueled largely by rising sales of new crossover vehicles. He said overall sales, which include those made to rental car companies and other fleet buyers, would drop by a single-digit percentage when compared with May of last year. Ford is trying to cut low-profit sales to rental car companies, and Pipas said that would drop about 20 percent in May from the same month last year. Pipas based his retail sales prediction on data collected through Monday night, but he would not predict the size of the increase. "The way things are progressing, it could well be our highest level of retail sales since August of last year," when the company was trying to clear out vehicles at the end of a model year, he said. The better retail sales results are due to rapidly rising sales of the Ford Edge and Lincoln MKX crossovers, which are vehicles that can do the things a truck-based sport utility vehicle can but are more fuel efficient because they are built on car underpinnings. The two new crossovers should help Ford's crossover sales grow 70 percent when compared with last May, when Ford, Lincoln and Mercury had only three crossovers, the Ford Escape and Freestyle and the Mercury Mariner, Pipas said. Pipas also predicted that U.S. sales will rebound a bit from a low April, due largely to increased sales of crossovers and small cars because of high gasoline prices. Automakers will release their May sales data on Friday. Most others do not comment until the data is released.
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7746882.html Ex-Ernst & Young partners accused of tax fraud conspiracy & Young partners accused of tax fraud conspiracy AM PDT NEW YORK (AP) - Four current and former partners of the giant accounting firm Ernst & Young were charged Wednesday with tax fraud conspiracy and other crimes relating to tax shelters that helped the wealthy escape taxes on incomes exceeding $10 million. All four worked in a group set up by the company in 1998 to develop tax shelters, according to an indictment filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. They allegedly defrauded the Internal Revenue Service from 1998 through 2004 by designing, marketing and selling fraudulent tax shelters. U.S. Attorney Michael Garcia said in a statement that the indictment targets "tax professionals whose deceit costs this country untold millions in tax revenues." An Ernst & Young spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment. It was not immediately known who would represent the four men at court appearances later Wednesday. The indictment said the partners knew that if the IRS detected use of the tax shelters by their clients, it would aggressively challenge the claimed tax benefits. To hide the tax fraud from the IRS, the defendants created documents containing false and fraudulent descriptions of the clients' motivations for entering into the transactions, the indictment said. The partners enticed clients to participate in the shelters by getting law firms to provide letters claiming that the tax shelter losses or deductions would "more likely than not" survive IRS challenge, the court papers said. The four knew the opinions were based on false and fraudulent statements but believed they would undermine the ability of the IRS to determine the clients' tax liabilities and decide whether penalties should be imposed, according to the indictment. The partners were seeking entry into the highly lucrative tax shelter market that was already being explored by other companies, the indictment said. Those charged were identified as Robert Coplan, 54, a Plano, Texas, lawyer who once was a branch chief in the IRS' Legislation and Regulations Division; Martin Nissenbaum, 51, of Brooklyn, a lawyer; Richard Shapiro, 58, of Rye Brook, N.Y., also a lawyer, and an accountant, Brian Vaughn, 39, of Calhoun, La. They were charged with conspiracy to defraud the IRS, tax evasion, making false statements and impeding and impairing the lawful functioning of the IRS.
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7746917.html Qatar Airways signs new contract for more A350 jets Airways signs new contract for more A350 jets AM PDT PARIS (AP) - Qatar Airways extended a much-needed boost to Airbus on Wednesday, ordering another 20 A350s to become the European jetmaker's largest customer for the wide-body jet with a total order of 80 planes worth a listing price of $16 billion. The agreement was signed by Qatar Airways President Akbar Al Baker beside new French President Nicolas Sarkozy and Qatari Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. The A350 is Airbus' challenger to Boeing Co.'s 787 long-range, mid-sized aircraft. "It's one of Airbus' biggest ever orders," said Airbus Chief Executive Louis Gallois, also present at the signing. He said that other orders could be in the pipeline. The Qatar Airways agreement for 20 A350-800s, 40 A350-900s and 20 A350-1000s, as with most large orders, would likely come with deep discounts from the listing price. The agreement replaces an earlier one for 60 A350s signed in 2005. Airbus has been losing customers for mid-sized jets to U.S. rival Boeing and was forced last year to launch a costly redesign of the planned A350 to compete with Boeing's 777 and 787 Dreamliner, due to enter service in 2008. The European planemaker has bet heavily on future demand for superjumbos to serve increasingly congested airports worldwide. Yet its large A380 craft has been beset by legal, technical and managerial problems. Two years of accumulated delays to the 555-seater A380 have wiped more than 5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) off Airbus' profit forecasts for 2006-2010. It also has also been suffering from a falling dollar - the currency in which it sells its planes. The commitment for 20 extra planes brings Airbus' total orders for the A350 to 268. Of those, there are firm orders for 71 A350-800 and 33 A350-900. Airbus is forecasting the first commercial delivery of the A350 will be in 2013. Gallois said Tuesday that Qatar has expressed an interest in investing in Airbus parent European Aeronautic Defence & Space Co. NV. Sarkozy has vowed his government will seek new investors for EADS, seeking changes to the shareholder pact as existing shareholders Lagardere SCA and DaimlerChrysler AG try to reduce their holdings. The French state owns 15 percent of EADS, while Paris-based Lagardere owns 7.5 percent. Their combined stake is balanced by German holdings of Stuttgart-based DaimlerChrysler and a consortium of private and state-run investors. Qatar, in the Persian Gulf, sits atop the world's largest field of natural gas. Natural gas exports are financing a rapid expansion of the capital, Doha, and bankrolling the state-owned airline. A tourism boom in the Middle East is contributing to the region's air traffic growth. Airbus claims its A350, made from carbon fiber wings and composites will be lighter per seat and more economical than existing crafts. Boeing's 787 is expected to enter commercial service next May. To date, Boeing has racked up 568 orders for the 787, which it says will be 20 percent more fuel-efficient than comparable jets. Shares in EADS fell 1.1 percent to 22.98 euros ($30.94) in Paris.
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7751992.html Ballmer: Microsoft won't make a cell phone Microsoft won't make a cell phone PM PDT PM PDT NEW YORK (Dow Jones/AP) - Microsoft Corp. has no plans to create a cell phone, preferring to focus on expanding its share of the market for cell-phone software, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said Wednesday. "I don't actually think it will make sense for us to make a cell phone," Ballmer said, speaking at The Wall Street Journal's "D: All Things Digital" conference in Carlsbad, Calif. Though he conceded that he once said the same thing about creating a music player, Ballmer said the better strategy for Microsoft is to partner with major handset makers. "There will be an operating system that sits in every phone," he said. "Will they come from us or someone else?" Apple Inc. is expected to introduce its first cell phone, the iPhone, soon. Ballmer said the company "is very committed" to its music player, the Zune. The device launched in November, but has so far failed to make much of dent in Apple's domination of the market for digital music players. Ballmer said the company will expand the Zune line, which he characterized as bare-bones, in an effort to get into the market quickly. "We'll have a lineup this Christmas that will be more exciting," he said.

AM PDT DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) - Ryanair Holdings PLC, Europe's largest discount airline, said Thursday that it ordered 27 Boeing 737-800s valued at $1.9 billion. All of the new single-aisle Boeing Co. aircraft will be fitted with technology that reduces fuel burn and carbon dioxide emissions. They will be delivered between September 2009 and March 2010. The list price does not necessarily indicate the amount Ryanair will pay, as airlines often negotiate discounts on large orders. The order brings Ryanair's total firm orders for Boeing 737-800s to 308 and total fleet size - including planned disposals - to 262 by 2012.
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7765342.html Wachovia to buy A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion in cash and stock to buy A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion in cash and stock AM PDT CHARLOTTE, N.C (AP) - Wachovia, the nation's fourth-largest bank, said Thursday it would acquire A.G. Edwards for $6.8 billion in cash and stock in a deal to form the second-largest retail brokerage firm in the United States. The combined brokerage unit will operate as Wachovia Securities, headquartered in St. Louis, and will have more than 3,300 brokerage locations nationwide, more than $1.1 trillion in client assets and nearly 15,000 financial advisers. Other A.G. Edwards businesses, including research, underwriting, investment banking, mutual funds and trust, will be consolidated into Wachovia's existing operating lines. "We believe A.G. Edwards is the premier independent brokerage company in the United States," Ken Thompson, Wachovia's chairman and chief executive, told analysts on a morning conference call. "When you combine A.G. Edwards with Wachovia Securities, we truly have an endgame player in the brokerage business." Wachovia Corp. said A.G. Edwards shareholders would get 0.9844 Wachovia shares and $35.80 in cash for each A.G. Edwards share held. That offer values A.G. Edwards Inc. at $89.50 per share based on Wednesday's closing prices, a 16 percent premium. Wachovia shares fell 30 cents to $54.25 in morning trading. A.G. Edwards shares jumped $10.66, or nearly 14 percent, to $87.81. "The long-term growth opportunities of the brokerage industry are extremely compelling to Wachovia, and we have long expressed our interest in growing this business both organically and through acquisition," Thompson said. The deal continues a string of high-profile acquisitions engineered by Charlotte, N.C.-based Wachovia, including First Union, Prudential Securities and, most recently, Golden West Financial Corp. That $24.2 billion deal, which closed in October, expanded Wachovia's mortgage business, an industry that had slowed at the time of the buyout, and gave the company a foothold in California, a state where it had just a handful of branch offices. By adding A.G. Edwards, Wachovia will gain thousands of brokerage customers they can target for traditional banking products, including mortgages, deposit accounts, auto loans and credit card services. "The demand for our clients to have one-stop financial services ... this is critical as we move into the future," said A.G. Edwards Chairman and CEO Robert Bagby. The transaction, which is expected to close in October, with full integration by early 2009, makes Wachovia the second-largest American retail brokerage by number of brokers, after Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., and propels Wachovia past Citigroup Inc.'s Smith Barney. Wachovia Securities will become the third-largest brokerage by assets and number of branches. "While Wachovia has made strides to be among the top retail brokerages with its acquisition of the Prudential brokerage operation, it was never considered in the big leagues with Merrill Lynch, Smith Barney & Morgan Stanley," said Robert Ellis, senior analyst at Celent, a Boston-based financial research and consulting firm. "So, like most acquisitions, this one has an aspect of ego attached." Several analysts questioned Wachovia's ability to retain A.G. Edwards' financial advisers, who have the existing relationships with the customers that Wachovia is after. "We believe Wachovia's willingness to move Wachovia Securities headquarters to St. Louis may have overcome a sticking point for A.G. Edwards with other potential suitors and could help alleviate some of the cultural challenges that arrive through the deal," wrote Banc of America Securities analyst John McDonald in a research note to clients. Over the past four years, Wachovia has lost about 3 percent of its advisers through attrition. The bank said it does not see that number changing, but has set aside more than $1 billion for broker retention over the next six years, said David Carroll, head of Wachovia's capital management group. "We have a lot to offer our brokerage advisers and we think we can make it economical for them," Carroll said in an interview. Wachovia said Daniel J. Ludeman, currently president and chief executive of its Wachovia Securities unit, will keep those roles at the combined brokerage unit. Bagby will be chairman of the brokerage.
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7765367.html Smaller, trimmer Northwest Airlines steps out of Chapter 11 protection trimmer Northwest Airlines steps out of Chapter 11 protection AM PDT MINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Northwest Airlines Corp. is emerging from Chapter 11 a little smaller, a lot more efficient, and with some of the lowest costs among the major carriers. Northwest shares were set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange Thursday morning, with CEO Doug Steenland ringing the opening bell, marking the end of a wave of airline bankruptcies that began after the Sept. 11 attacks. Northwest has slashed debt by $4.2 billion, cut $400 million a year in the cost of its fleet, and trimmed unprofitable routes. It cut labor costs by $1.4 billion a year, too, in a bruising four-year fight with its unions that did nothing to erase Northwest's reputation for terrible labor relations. On Wednesday, flight attendants and pilots in St. Paul protested executive pay by rallying around a giant inflatable rat clutching bags of money in its paws. Northwest's 400 top managers are set to get a collective 5 percent equity stake in the reorganized company worth an estimated $297 million. "They're going to have dramatically different economics post-bankruptcy, which is the good news," said Vaughn Cordle, who runs number-crunching firm Airline Forecasts and is an airline pilot. "The bad news is they've beaten down labor so much that they've got morale problems." Like the rest of the airline industry, Northwest has been on a roller coaster the past decade. On Sept. 10, 2001, the airline industry was coming off the 1990s economic boom, as business travel rose and fuel prices stayed low. U.S. airlines raked in around $5 billion a year in profits from 1997 through 1999 and almost $2.5 billion in 2000, according to government statistics compiled by the Air Transport Association. But Sept. 11, the slowing economy, and the run-up to the Iraq war hurt business travel, and rising fuel prices hurt airline profitability. Northwest was also hurt by the SARS scare in Asia, where it and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines are the two largest U.S. carriers. Eagan-based Northwest and Delta Air Lines Inc. both filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 14, 2005, putting four of the nation's seven largest carriers into Chapter 11. At the end of 2005, Northwest's costs were higher than every other airline except U.S. Airways Group Inc., according to government figures. By the end of 2006, when most of the airline restructuring was finished, Northwest's costs were lower than those at U.S. Airways, Delta, and Continental Airlines Inc., though still higher than costs at AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and arch-competitor United. Labor costs per mile flown, meanwhile, are now lower than at those carriers and only slightly higher than at Southwest Airlines Co., Cordle said. (Southwest workers still make more on average than Northwest employees.) Cordle said Northwest has done an excellent job reducing its costs in bankruptcy. But he worries that Northwest's debt, while lower than it was, is still higher than is healthy - especially considering that Northwest's fleet is old and that it will soon be spending money to upgrade it. Northwest plans to emerge from bankruptcy with roughly $9.2 billion in debt. But it also plans to spend $1.4 billion this year and almost $1.8 billion next year adding to its fleet, including the addition of Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner next year. "Northwest may have shed $4 billion in debt, but they're still an over-leveraged airline," Cordle said. Moody's Investors Service rated Northwest's debt one notch higher than Delta's when Delta emerged from bankruptcy last month. Moody's analyst George Godlin said Northwest's routes in Asia and its relative dominance in the Midwest justified that. Delta, meanwhile, is reshuffling its domestic routes and adding international flights, including new routes to Africa, which may take time to become profitable, he said. "We felt that sticking to the knitting and doing things that they do really well" will give Northwest an advantage, he said. One advantage Northwest will have is that its new labor contracts lock workers into lower pay rates and more company-friendly work rules through the end of 2011, longer than any of its U.S. competitors. Flight attendants, for instance, now see their pay top out at about $35,400 a year, down from $44,190 before Northwest filed for bankruptcy protection, according to the union. Flight attendants Trevor and Amanda Olson of Andover, Minn., have felt that pinch. They met on a Christmas shift on a DC-10 and began dating a few months later. "Northwest has been good to us in that one regard," said Amanda, who is now on maternity leave. "In every other regard we've been having things taken away and taken away and taken away." "We're both considering new careers and looking for new jobs," she said at the rally Wednesday over executive pay. "One of us has to leave. We just have decided we both can't stay. It's not within our budget to both be here. We're worth more than what we're being paid." Steenland acknowledged that workers are upset in a hot line message to employees earlier this month. "For many, these prospects in the restructuring are bittersweet, because as exciting as they are, they have been made possible only at significant cost," he said. "We must honor these sacrifices through a careful and caring stewardship of our airline and its future." Even with the restructuring by the major carriers over the past five years, it's still a volatile business and no one is ruling out future trips to Chapter 11. "I can see that the next economic downturn may not be as severe as Sept. 11, but it's going to put a lot of pressure on them again," airline consultant Alan Sbarra said of the industry in general. "I think the big lesson everyone should learn from this is that the industry has not fundamentally changed."
http://www.komotv.com/news/business/7765397.html Economy grows by just 0.6 percent grows by just 0.6 percent AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) -The economy nearly stalled with growth slowing to a pace of just 0.6 percent. That was the worst three-month showing in over four years. The new reading on the gross domestic product, released by the Commerce Department Thursday, showed that economic growth in the January-through-March quarter was much weaker. Government statisticians slashed by more than half their first estimate of a 1.3 percent growth rate for the quarter. The main culprits for the downgrade: the bloated trade deficit and businesses cutting investment in supplies of the goods they hold in inventories. "We are still keeping our head above water - barely," said economist Ken Mayland of ClearView Economics. For nearly a year, the economy has been enduring a stretch of subpar economic growth due mostly to a sharp housing slump. That in turn has made some businesses act more cautiously in their spending and investing. The economy's 0.6 percent growth rate in the opening quarter of this year marked a big loss of momentum from the 2.5 percent pace logged in the final quarter of last year. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke doesn't believe the economy will slide into recession this year, nor do Bush administration officials. But ex Fed chief Alan Greenspan has put the odds at one in three. The first-quarter's performance was the weakest since the final quarter of 2002, when the economy recovering from a recession. At that time, GDP eked out a 0.2 percent growth rate. Economists were predicting the first-quarter performance this year would be downgraded, but not as much as it did. They were calling for a 0.8 percent growth rate pace. GDP measures the value of all goods and services produced in the United States. It is considered the best measure of the country's economic fitness. In more encouraging economic news, the Labor Department reported that fewer people signed up for unemployment benefits last week. New filings dropped by 4,000 to 310,000. That suggests the employment climate is weathering well the economy's sluggish spell. Many economists believe the first quarter will be the low point for this year. They expect growth will improve but still be sluggish. The National Association for Business Economics predicts the economy will expand at a 2.3 percent pace in the April-to-June quarter. In the first quarter, there was a larger trade deficit than first thought. That ended up shaving a full percentage point from the GDP. Businesses cut back on inventory investment as they tried to make sure unsold stocks of goods didn't get out of whack with customer demand. That lopped off nearly a percentage point to first quarter GDP. Those were the biggest factors behind the government slicing its initial GDP estimate released a month ago by as much as it did. The sour housing market also restrained overall economic activity. Investment in home building was cut by 15.4 percent, on an annualized basis, However, that wasn't as deep a cut as the 17 percent annualized drop initally estimated. And, it wasn't as severe as the 19.8 percent annualized drop seen in the final quarter of last year. Even so, there is no doubt that troubled housing market is one of the biggest problems for the economy. Although some businesses tightened the belt consumers did not. That helped to prevent the economy from stalling out altogether. Consumers boosted their spending by a 4.4 percent growth rate the most in a year. Consumer spending accounts for a major chunk of economic activity. Some economists wonder how much interest consumers will have in continued brisk spending, however, given rising gasoline prices that have topped $3 a gallon in many markets. More money spent filling up the gas tank leaves less to spend on other things. One of the reasons consumers have stayed so resilient even as the housing market has been stuck in a rut for a year is because the job market has been good. One of the reasons consumers have stayed so resilient even as the housing market has been stuck in a rut for a year is because the job market has been good. Employers may be tightening the belt on some spending but they are not drastically clamping down on hiring. Company profits gained a bit of ground One measure showed after tax profits rising by 1 percent, up from 0.8 percent in the fourth quarter. An inflation gauge tied to the GDP report and closely watched by the Fed showed that core prices - excluding food and energy - rose at a rate of 2.2 percent That was unchanged from its initial estimate but up from a 1.8 percent pace in the fourth quarter. The Federal Reserve's key interest rate has been at 5.25 percent for nearly a year. Many economists predict the rate probably will stay right where it is through the rest of this year.

(AP) - Warehouse retailer Costco Wholesale Corp. said Thursday its fiscal third-quarter profit declined 4.9 percent due to a charge, but sales advanced at a double-digit pace. Income for the quarter ended May 13 slid to $224 million from $235.6 million. Per-share earnings were flat at 49 cents. The latest quarter includes a $30.3 million charge to reflect the reduced gross margin on estimated future returns recorded in the increased sales return reserve. Excluding the item, earnings per share were 56 cents, in line with the average analyst estimate, according to a Thomson Financial survey. Sales rose 10 percent to $14.34 billion from $13.01 billion but were shy of the consensus estimate of $14.68 billion. Costco booked a reserve to increase its sales returns reserve balance that trimmed sales in the most recent quarter by $228.2 million. Excluding the reserve, sales rose 12 percent to $14.57 billion. Quarterly same-store sales rose 7 percent, reflecting a 7 percent domestic increase and 10 percent international growth. Same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, are a key measure of retailer performance, because they measure growth at existing stores rather than from newly opened ones. Costco shares were up 66 cents to $57.23 at the open of trading Thursday.
