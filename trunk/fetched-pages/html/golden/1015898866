Mulally, did both on Monday. Speaking with journalists in a conference call, Mr. Mulally said, &#8220;I clearly believe the vast majority of data indicates that the temperature has increased. And I believe the correlation and analysis that it&#8217;s mainly because of greenhouse gases.&#8221; His comments came as Mr. Mulally announced a promotion for a Ford vice president, Susan M. Cischke, to a new job as senior vice president for sustainability, environment and safety engineering. Ms. Cischke, who now reports to Mr. Mulally instead of to Ford&#8217;s Washington office, will be in charge of creating a long-range strategy on sustainability matters. The first executive at a Detroit auto company to have sustainability in her job title, she previously was vice president of environmental and safety engineering. She becomes the highest-ranking woman at Ford and the latest executive to take on an expanded role since Mr. Mulally became chief executive in September. The auto industry is facing the likelihood that it will be forced to make cars and trucks that achieve better gasoline mileage. On April 2 the Supreme Court ruled that the had the authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from automobiles. The primary way that can be done, carmakers and environmentalists say, is to increase automobile fuel economy. As a result, Detroit carmakers, which have a long history of fighting regulations, are saying they want an active role in the movement to reduce the damage vehicles do to the environment. They may have little choice: lawmakers have introduced measures in Congress to raise federal fuel economy standards to as high as 40 miles a gallon, from the current standard of 27.5 miles a gallon for cars and 24 miles a gallon for light trucks. Likewise, the Bush administration is proposing a series of steps on the environment that include raising fuel economy by about one mile a gallon each year over the next few years. &#8220;We can have it if we all work together,&#8221; Mr. Mulally said Monday. Ford has previously tried to position itself as an environmentally conscious company, especially when Mr. Mulally&#8217;s predecessor, William Clay Ford Jr. , was in charge, only to pull back on promises of building more efficient vehicles. For example, it abandoned a pledge, made in 2000, to improve the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005. Last year Ford gave up on plans to sell 250,000 hybrid-electric vehicles each year by the end of the decade, saying instead that it would place greater emphasis on developing vehicles that can run on fuels other than gasoline, like E85, a mix of ethanol and gasoline. Mr. Mulally acknowledged that Ford had made those vows before it had the technology to achieve them. &#8220;On one hand, you have to give Ford credit for being a leader and for being out front originally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On the other side, we&#8217;re just seeing another recommitment of Ford that this is really important and we&#8217;re going to make it a high priority of the company.&#8221; Representatives of environmental groups said that they were glad to see Mr. Mulally&#8217;s latest steps but had not forgotten Ford&#8217;s record. &#8220;It&#8217;s always good when we see a company making steps toward becoming more environmentally sustainable,&#8221; said Mike Hudema, director of the Freedom From Oil Campaign, an alliance of three environmental groups. &#8220;But we do always have to put that in context with Ford&#8217;s history,&#8221; he said, &#8220;which unfortunately on the environmental front is not a very good one.&#8221; Dan Becker, director of the global warming program at the , said Ford was good at making promises to help the environment but &#8220;when it comes to doing them they seem to forget or fall down on the job.&#8221; He questioned whether Ms. Cischke was the right executive to focus on sustainability, saying that she had testified before Congress opposing steps the Sierra Club had proposed. &#8220;It&#8217;s as if the Yankees promoted manager to reach out to the Red Sox,&#8221; he said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/automobiles/15TRAILER.html	Airstream: The Concept Travels Well - New York Times Airstream: The Concept Travels Well The classic Airstream trailer still appeals to a nation of rolling stones. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 15, 2007 AS if abandoned by a misdirected camper who parked in the dark, a silver Airstream trailer sits these days in the lobby of the Museum of Modern Art. A model called the Bambi, designed in 1960 with Airstream&#8217;s distinctive streamlined riveted skin, has been acquired for the museum&#8217;s design collection. Skip to next paragraph Keeping The Shiny Side Up The first Airstream, the Clipper, arrived in 1936 amid a national craze for streamlining &#151; in cars, in buildings, in toasters &#151; as the brainchild of an inventor and travel promoter named Wally Byam. After World War II, as the highway system expanded, the economy boomed and Airstreams gained starring roles in Hollywood films, the trailer came to symbolize American-style travel. Airstream&#8217;s appeal seems to have few limits, and indeed a powerful world traveler recently provided proof of its persistent appeal. On a trip to Asia in February, Vice President traveled in an Airstream &#151; inside an airplane. Mark Silva, chief of the Washington bureau of The Chicago Tribune, accompanied the vice president as the press corps&#8217; pool print reporter. The group flew on a huge gray C-17 cargo plane that the Air Force calls the Spirit of , in honor of the late senator. Mr. Silva said that when he boarded he noted the familiar outline of the Airstream roof inside the vast fuselage. &#8220;I crawled on the floor to look at the nameplate,&#8221; Mr. Silva said, confirming that it read &#8220;Airstream, Jackson Center, Ohio.&#8221; Inside, Mr. Silva said in an interview, &#8220;there were plush leather chairs, blue-gray carpet, wood paneling, recessed lighting and a TV and DVD player.&#8221; He said the Airstream reminded him of one of the first he had seen, on the cover of a Ry Cooder record album from 1970. &#8220;The Airstream is the symbol of taking it on the road with style,&#8221; he added. A home for the road, the Airstream has long intrigued Americans as an ideal combination of their twin loves, vehicle and home. Its functionalism also let it be read as a symbol of the ideals of modern architecture. Christian Larsen, a curatorial assistant in &#8217;s department of architecture and design, said, &#8220;The Bambi is a machine for living and traveling, the sort of industrialized, rationalized vessel that had long been the dream object of modernist architects, from Le Corbusier to Buckminster Fuller.&#8221; Mr. Larsen also related the Airstream to the work of artists like Andrea Zittel, who builds trailerlike works, installed in galleries or outdoor installations. In recent years, the Airstream has attracted the attention of automakers, too. Nissan Design America, the California studio of the Japanese automaker, produced an Airstream trailer concept displayed at auto shows after its introduction at the New York International Contemporary Furniture Fair in 2003. Bryan Thompson, one of the designers, said Nissan&#8217;s work with Airstream led to the BaseCamp, a $20,000 trailer with a pop-up Kelty tent. The BaseCamp, which is now sold by Airstream, is light enough to be towed by the average car. &#8220;Airstream is one of those companies that is part of the heart and soul of American design,&#8221; Mr. Thompson said. &#8220;The shape is timeless, the materials are modern and the fabrication is hands-on traditional. They have the ability to combine Old World handmade craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology.&#8221; More recently, Airstream, which is based in Jackson Center, Ohio, and now owned by Thor Industries, has collaborated with Ford. The automaker&#8217;s Airstream design study, a crossover wagon theoretically powered by hydrogen fuel cells, was unveiled in Detroit in January and has been on display at the New York auto show, which closes today. The alliance grew out of a high-concept future study ordered by J Mays, the group vice president for design at Ford, to explore the American journey. The result was a concept vehicle of gleaming aluminum and orange window frames aimed at the growing number of baby boomers who are 55 and older &#151; a group that has historically accounted for a large percentage of trailer buyers. &#8220;The Ford Airstream concept captures the sense of optimism and adventure conveyed in American aircraft, spacecraft and the streamlined shape of Airstream trailers,&#8221; Mr. Mays said. The Ford concept realizes Wally Byam&#8217;s dream of eventually making the Airstream a self-propelled land yacht. (He foresaw a motorized portion that would detach from the mothership, like a dinghy.) It recalls the VW Microbus, and for that matter the Stout Scarab, a 1935 precursor to the minivan. Inside, the Ford concept car shifts its frame of reference to more distant travel. The materials and colors &#151; called &#8220;cosmic red and white&#8221; &#151; were inspired by the spacecraft in the 1968 film &#8220;2001: A Space Odyssey.&#8221; Space buffs will recall another connection between space travel and Airstream. In 1969, upon their return from the moon, the Apollo 11 astronauts were quartered inside a modified Airstream called the mobile quarantine facility. They remained in the silver pod for three weeks; President visited and waved at the astronauts through the window.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 ACURA says the exterior styling of its redesigned MDX sport wagon was inspired by high-end yachts, like the Wally Boat. Skip to next paragraph The X Files: Four Luxury Crossovers Really? From a side view, I see the profile of one of those surplus World War II DUKW amphibious craft. Duck Tour, anyone? In considering what the second-generation MDX should look like, Acura’s designers decided to depart from the safe me-too look of most S.U.V.’s. They wanted to make a notice-me statement, and they have certainly succeeded, from the anime-inspired grille to the nautical prow to the hunched haunches. The MDX made its debut as a 2001 model, greatly improving on the poorly received Isuzu-built SLX sport utility that Acura had previously tried to sell. The MDX hit the streets with stellar build quality, quickly built a reliability record to match and gained immediate respect. What it didn’t get was a lot of buyers. Competitors, including luxury sport wagons from German manufacturers, had a decided advantage in overall performance. The MDX was also saddled with comparatively bland styling. Worse, its own stablemate, the similar but less expensive Honda Pilot, poached sales from the same pool of buyers. Still, I considered the MDX a best buy, because it offered perhaps the auto industry’s best array of standard features at an excellent price in the mid-$30,000 range. Initially, the only option was a $2,000 DVD navigation system. For 2007, the base price has passed $40,000, and although the Acura still has an enviable array of standard features, a buyer seeking a loaded MDX must shell out another $8,000 for options. Acura is gambling that it can change minds and buying decisions in the high end of the S.U.V. market where BMW, Porsche and Mercedes play. In the past, MDX buyers were mostly women, who considered the outgoing MDX a comfortable, cushy, bullet-proof people hauler and grocery getter. This new model will probably seem like overkill to them. Now Acura is aiming at men. The MDX has been completely reimagined as a cutting-edge performance machine, with macho styling and a positively Teutonic array of electronic and telematic equipment. The MDX still comes only with a V-6, but the new 3.7-liter engine makes a more competitive 300 horsepower; indeed, this is Acura’s most powerful engine ever — even the discontinued NSX exotic sports car mustered only 253 horsepower. A dual-stage intake manifold and unusually high 11.0:1 compression ratio give the MDX’s engine the punch of a V-8 while sipping fuel like a V-6. In combined city and highway driving, I found it traveled nearly 20 miles on a gallon of premium unleaded. The MDX also still comes with a five-speed automatic that can be shifted like a manual. Although some competitors offer six- and even seven-speed transmissions, the MDX didn’t seem gear-deprived. This year, power is delivered as needed to each wheel through Acura’s savvy Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive system (introduced in the RL sedan), wherein the outside wheels can rotate faster to facilitate cornering. The racetrack-tuned suspension offers switchable sport and comfort settings. A magnetic shock-absorber system, included with the optional Sport Package, includes two-mode active dampers that increase stability and body control in hard maneuvers without ill effects on the ride. The MDX’s quickness and dexterity compare favorably with pricier high-performance rivals like the Porsche Cayenne and BMW X5. What’s more, towing capacity is 5,000 pounds, certainly adequate for a car-based utility. Standard safety equipment includes front air bags, side air bags mounted in the front seats, full-length side curtain bags, active front head restraints, stability control with a stabilizing feature for towing, tire-pressure monitors and antilock disc brakes with brake assist. The brakes, by the way, provided strong, sure stops. The MDX has grown to seven-passenger capacity, with three rows of seats; leather is standard on all MDXs. The power-adjustable front seats are handsome, firm and supportive. The roomy second row, which folds in a 60-40 configuration, has reclining seatbacks and a folding center section that doubles as an armrest with cup holders (in addition to other beverage and gear cubbies in the door pockets and elsewhere). The third row, split 50-50, is fit only for children. Next Article in Automobiles (1 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

A magnetic shock-absorber system, included with the optional Sport Package, includes two-mode active dampers that increase stability and body control in hard maneuvers without ill effects on the ride. The MDX’s quickness and dexterity compare favorably with pricier high-performance rivals like the Porsche Cayenne and BMW X5. What’s more, towing capacity is 5,000 pounds, certainly adequate for a car-based utility. Standard safety equipment includes front air bags, side air bags mounted in the front seats, full-length side curtain bags, active front head restraints, stability control with a stabilizing feature for towing, tire-pressure monitors and antilock disc brakes with brake assist. The brakes, by the way, provided strong, sure stops. The MDX has grown to seven-passenger capacity, with three rows of seats; leather is standard on all MDXs. The power-adjustable front seats are handsome, firm and supportive. The roomy second row, which folds in a 60-40 configuration, has reclining seatbacks and a folding center section that doubles as an armrest with cup holders (in addition to other beverage and gear cubbies in the door pockets and elsewhere). The third row, split 50-50, is fit only for children. Next Article in Automobiles (1 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph Who Needs Car Keys? Around the floor of the New York International Auto Show, which runs through tomorrow, doors swing open to reveal push-button starters — no key necessary. They can be found on about 55 cars and trucks, including luxury models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes, and on Nissan’s inexpensive Versa as part of a $700 “convenience package.” Push-button starters have also become standard on hybrid-electric vehicles, like the Toyota Prius. James D. Farley, the chief of North American marketing at Toyota, said that he has been fretting about whether to build all future models with push-button starters. “What keeps me awake?” he asked recently. “Car keys.” Push-button starters are a retro feature, dating back to the industry’s toddler years. In 1913, the Locomobile became one of the first cars to use one. Carmakers also started using keys around that time, after ignitions (and car theft) were invented. Today’s keyless models use a fob — the small remote control device that most modern cars use to lock and unlock doors — but it performs the additional duty of sending a signal to the ignition. For the car to start, the fob has to be somewhere near the dashboard, perhaps stowed in a cup holder. A driver then just needs to put a foot on the brake, and push the button. The engine comes to life, or, in the case of hybrids, the word “ready” lights up on the dashboard. Turning off the car happens the same way: gearshift in park, foot on the brake, finger on the button. Not everyone is quite ready to give up keys. Honda decided not to offer a push-button starter on its newest MDX model, sold by its Acura luxury division. The cost of installing sensors to operate the ignition, said its chief engineer, Frank Paluch, was more than Honda thought even well-heeled customers would be willing to pay. But that may change as other car companies shift to push-buttons, sending car keys to the same bin now filled with window cranks and whitewall tires.

QUAIN Published: April 22, 2007 FEW people get behind the wheel alone anymore. Many drivers wouldn’t dare pull away from the curb without their cellphone, iPod or P.D.A. — mobile devices essential to life on the move, though not necessarily designed for use in cars. Skip to next paragraph Getting Connected Without Plugging In Smarter Lights, Minus the Blues To make the devices better, less distracting driving companions, more carmakers and electronics companies are using Bluetooth technology, which wirelessly connects phones to a headset or to the car’s sound system. Bluetooth is becoming the wireless standard in vehicles, and it has ambitions far beyond hands-free cellphone use. The benefit of Bluetooth is that it frees the hands of a driver talking on the phone, though it does not address the larger problem of diverted attention while holding a conversation. It allows users to leave a Bluetooth-equipped cellphone in a pocket or purse and still make and receive phone calls, either with a cordless headset or by using speakers and a microphone built into the vehicle. In addition, the voice-activated dialing with today’s cellphones can be used through a microphone in the car’s headliner with the driver’s hands on the wheel. One inspiration to use wireless Bluetooth devices in cars was the enactment of hands-free cellphone laws across the country. “The laws did help with the visibility and awareness of Bluetooth,” said Mike Foley, executive director of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, a nonprofit trade group. California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Washington, D.C., have all passed laws mandating the use of hands-free systems for cellphone calls. Municipalities from Florida to Utah have similar laws. Named for a 10th-century king credited with uniting warring factions of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Bluetooth was designed to allow devices to communicate across distances of 30 feet or less. Today, every major cellphone maker includes this radio-frequency technology. And there is a wide variety of rechargeable Bluetooth headsets available from companies like Jabra, Logitech, Motorola, Nokia and Sony Ericsson. Many, however, are not designed strictly for motorists. When the headsets lose their power, for example, users often have to wait until they are at the office or home to recharge the device. One exception is Plantronics’s Discovery 665 Bluetooth Headset, which costs $150 and comes with a folding cigarette lighter charger. The tiny in-ear Discovery also uses a digital signal processor to reduce road and wind noise. Not everybody is comfortable driving with something stuck in their ear, so some automakers are offering Bluetooth as part of integrated systems. BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota offer Bluetooth in some models. The factory-installed systems allow drivers to take a call with the push of a button, like a speaker phone, while the system automatically mutes the car’s sound system. One notable laggard in Bluetooth adoption has been General Motors, which has favored its own wireless OnStar system. Only G.M.’s Cadillac STS has Bluetooth, but that may be about to change. G.M. “is developing Bluetooth in a wide range of products,” said Pete Barkey, a company spokesman. He declined to provide a timetable for its introduction in other models. Other carmakers and consumer electronics companies are looking to expand Bluetooth’s wireless possibilities. “The original scenario was purely hands-free operation,” said Mr. Foley, the trade group executive. “Now it’s pretty common to be able to synchronize a phone’s contacts with the car setup.” This allows drivers to dial a number simply by saying the person’s name. They can also see who’s calling on the vehicle’s stereo display. More cellphones, music players and headsets are also supporting Bluetooth’s Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), which allows devices to play stereo music through a car’s sound system without wires. Several Samsung phones can play music this way, for example, and iPod owners can purchase adapters like the Jabra A125s.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 WHILE Cadillac has staged a respectable revival of late, times are still tough for Lincoln, the other venerable American luxury line. Skip to next paragraph The X Files: Four Luxury Crossovers Lincoln had its last bona fide hit, the Navigator sport utility, nearly a decade ago. In the years since, it has posted a lineup that could confirm the existence of chaos theory. The bizarre Blackwood pickup for 2002 was dead on arrival — appropriate, since it came only in black and featured what appeared to be a powered coffin lid over a carpeted bed. Failing to take the hint, Lincoln brought out another luxury pickup, the Mark LT, which has also underperformed in the showroom. On the sport utility front, Lincoln cobbled together the Aviator for 2002. It was basically a Ford Explorer with a deluxe interior, but at a price above $45,000, few left the hangar. Beyond its price, the Aviator’s failing — and Lincoln’s, too — was to miss the crossover wave. Models like the Lexus RX, now the perennial top seller among luxury sport utilities, were really cars underneath. By and large, Americans have discovered in recent years that they prefer crossovers to truck-centric models like the Aviator. Better late than never, Lincoln now paddles in with its first crossover: the MKX, not to be confused with Acura’s competing MDX — or with Lincoln’s own MKZ, a sedan formerly known as the Zephyr, or its yet-to-come MKS. (Chaos also rules the Lincoln’s naming department.) Based on the Ford Edge and Mazda CX-9, the five-passenger MKX is vastly more flightworthy than the Aviator. It is competent and quite striking. It starts at $36,445 including optional all-wheel drive, far less than other luxury models of its size: about $3,000 below the Lexus RX 350, about $4,000 less than the Acura, about $7,000 below a Mercedes ML350. But let’s be honest. The MKX may impress price shoppers and Lincoln loyalists, or people who remember where they were when Barry Goldwater got the Republican nomination. But it is less likely to impress people who have forged lasting relationships with rich foreigners, like the sport wagons from Lexus, Mercedes and BMW. No doubt, the Lincoln wins some style points: The MKX has an aerodynamic shape that even the Jetsons might like, and a wall-to-wall chrome grille that adds some visual sizzle. It’s a handsome ride. The interior is reasonably comfortable, though the front seats were handicapped by a short, hard bottom cushion. A central touch screen smoothly controls the audio system, navigation unit and other functions. (Lincoln could teach BMW and Mercedes a thing or two about user-friendly electronics.) An enormous sunroof is part of a $4,795 package that includes the navigation system, satellite radio and THX audio system. The MKX’s sharply angled windshield resulted in distracting reflections from vents atop the dashboard. But the gauges may be the biggest faux pas; did anyone at Lincoln notice how cheap they look? They’re penciled in a wispy, almost girlish font that recalls a J. C. Penney circular. The Lincoln’s neatest feature may be the dual buttons in the hatch area that drop the split 60-40 rear seats flat in a one-finger operation. There is useful storage back there, though the stylishly sloping roof reduces the ultimate capacity: both the Acura and Lexus have about 20 percent more space with the rear seats folded. On the road, the MKX is smooth, solid and quiet. But it drives like, well, a nice minivan, and I’d wager that a Honda Odyssey could beat it around a road course. Of course, the MKX is a prettified Ford Edge, and like that crossover wagon it feels rather large and unwieldy. Compared with the Ford, the Lincoln’s suspension is biased toward a comfortable ride, so it is tuned like a baby’s mashed potatoes: soft, messy and poorly controlled. The steering traces the right path, but the feel is vague and muffled. The 3.5-liter V-6, the new go-to engine for multiple Ford models, puts out a healthy 265 horsepower and 250 pound-feet of maximum torque. The six-speed automatic transmission is decently smooth, though the lack of manual-shift ability is another clue to the Lincoln’s easy-cruising intentions. The MKX also tips the scales at 4,420 pounds, one reason for a somewhat leisurely 8.1-second run from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. Yet despite the mass, the federal fuel economy rating is an impressive 17 miles a gallon in town, 24 on the highway, with all-wheel drive. (Front-drive models are rated 1 m.p.g. higher in town and country.) Braking is less impressive, though, as proved in testing by Car and Driver. The magazine recorded a 197-foot stop from 70 m.p.h., near the bottom in the class. The Lincoln weighs about 100 pounds less than the longer, wider Acura, and 300 less than a Mercedes M-Class. But the Acura, with its terrific suspension and performance-tuned all-wheel-drive system, feels like a nimble sport sedan in comparison — without any tradeoffs in ride or roominess. The Acura isn’t the only one: a homegrown rival, the Cadillac SRX, pioneered an adaptive magnetically controlled suspension that has been adopted by super sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette, Ferrari 599 GTB and Audi R8. As you might expect, the Cadillac outhandles the Lincoln. In the MKX’s defense, the Lexus RX is no barn burner, either. And again, the Lincoln undercuts the competition: stuffed with options, my test car checked in at $43,890. Skeptics will note that the Lincoln’s stablemate, the Ford Edge, has a base price about $8,800 lower. They may well dismiss the Lincoln as an overpriced Ford. But people who love the Lincoln’s looks, and value smoothness over sport, may prefer to call the MKX a bargain Lexus.

Compared with the Ford, the Lincoln’s suspension is biased toward a comfortable ride, so it is tuned like a baby’s mashed potatoes: soft, messy and poorly controlled. The steering traces the right path, but the feel is vague and muffled. The 3.5-liter V-6, the new go-to engine for multiple Ford models, puts out a healthy 265 horsepower and 250 pound-feet of maximum torque. The six-speed automatic transmission is decently smooth, though the lack of manual-shift ability is another clue to the Lincoln’s easy-cruising intentions. The MKX also tips the scales at 4,420 pounds, one reason for a somewhat leisurely 8.1-second run from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. Yet despite the mass, the federal fuel economy rating is an impressive 17 miles a gallon in town, 24 on the highway, with all-wheel drive. (Front-drive models are rated 1 m.p.g. higher in town and country.) Braking is less impressive, though, as proved in testing by Car and Driver. The magazine recorded a 197-foot stop from 70 m.p.h., near the bottom in the class. The Lincoln weighs about 100 pounds less than the longer, wider Acura, and 300 less than a Mercedes M-Class. But the Acura, with its terrific suspension and performance-tuned all-wheel-drive system, feels like a nimble sport sedan in comparison — without any tradeoffs in ride or roominess. The Acura isn’t the only one: a homegrown rival, the Cadillac SRX, pioneered an adaptive magnetically controlled suspension that has been adopted by super sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette, Ferrari 599 GTB and Audi R8. As you might expect, the Cadillac outhandles the Lincoln. In the MKX’s defense, the Lexus RX is no barn burner, either. And again, the Lincoln undercuts the competition: stuffed with options, my test car checked in at $43,890. Skeptics will note that the Lincoln’s stablemate, the Ford Edge, has a base price about $8,800 lower. They may well dismiss the Lincoln as an overpriced Ford. But people who love the Lincoln’s looks, and value smoothness over sport, may prefer to call the MKX a bargain Lexus.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 15, 2007 AS if abandoned by a misdirected camper who parked in the dark, a silver Airstream trailer sits these days in the lobby of the Museum of Modern Art. A model called the Bambi, designed in 1960 with Airstream&#8217;s distinctive streamlined riveted skin, has been acquired for the museum&#8217;s design collection. Skip to next paragraph Keeping The Shiny Side Up The first Airstream, the Clipper, arrived in 1936 amid a national craze for streamlining &#151; in cars, in buildings, in toasters &#151; as the brainchild of an inventor and travel promoter named Wally Byam. After World War II, as the highway system expanded, the economy boomed and Airstreams gained starring roles in Hollywood films, the trailer came to symbolize American-style travel. Airstream&#8217;s appeal seems to have few limits, and indeed a powerful world traveler recently provided proof of its persistent appeal. On a trip to Asia in February, Vice President traveled in an Airstream &#151; inside an airplane. Mark Silva, chief of the Washington bureau of The Chicago Tribune, accompanied the vice president as the press corps&#8217; pool print reporter. The group flew on a huge gray C-17 cargo plane that the Air Force calls the Spirit of , in honor of the late senator. Mr. Silva said that when he boarded he noted the familiar outline of the Airstream roof inside the vast fuselage. &#8220;I crawled on the floor to look at the nameplate,&#8221; Mr. Silva said, confirming that it read &#8220;Airstream, Jackson Center, Ohio.&#8221; Inside, Mr. Silva said in an interview, &#8220;there were plush leather chairs, blue-gray carpet, wood paneling, recessed lighting and a TV and DVD player.&#8221; He said the Airstream reminded him of one of the first he had seen, on the cover of a Ry Cooder record album from 1970. &#8220;The Airstream is the symbol of taking it on the road with style,&#8221; he added. A home for the road, the Airstream has long intrigued Americans as an ideal combination of their twin loves, vehicle and home. Its functionalism also let it be read as a symbol of the ideals of modern architecture. Christian Larsen, a curatorial assistant in &#8217;s department of architecture and design, said, &#8220;The Bambi is a machine for living and traveling, the sort of industrialized, rationalized vessel that had long been the dream object of modernist architects, from Le Corbusier to Buckminster Fuller.&#8221; Mr. Larsen also related the Airstream to the work of artists like Andrea Zittel, who builds trailerlike works, installed in galleries or outdoor installations. In recent years, the Airstream has attracted the attention of automakers, too. Nissan Design America, the California studio of the Japanese automaker, produced an Airstream trailer concept displayed at auto shows after its introduction at the New York International Contemporary Furniture Fair in 2003. Bryan Thompson, one of the designers, said Nissan&#8217;s work with Airstream led to the BaseCamp, a $20,000 trailer with a pop-up Kelty tent. The BaseCamp, which is now sold by Airstream, is light enough to be towed by the average car. &#8220;Airstream is one of those companies that is part of the heart and soul of American design,&#8221; Mr. Thompson said. &#8220;The shape is timeless, the materials are modern and the fabrication is hands-on traditional. They have the ability to combine Old World handmade craftsmanship with cutting-edge technology.&#8221; More recently, Airstream, which is based in Jackson Center, Ohio, and now owned by Thor Industries, has collaborated with Ford. The automaker&#8217;s Airstream design study, a crossover wagon theoretically powered by hydrogen fuel cells, was unveiled in Detroit in January and has been on display at the New York auto show, which closes today. The alliance grew out of a high-concept future study ordered by J Mays, the group vice president for design at Ford, to explore the American journey. The result was a concept vehicle of gleaming aluminum and orange window frames aimed at the growing number of baby boomers who are 55 and older &#151; a group that has historically accounted for a large percentage of trailer buyers. &#8220;The Ford Airstream concept captures the sense of optimism and adventure conveyed in American aircraft, spacecraft and the streamlined shape of Airstream trailers,&#8221; Mr. Mays said. The Ford concept realizes Wally Byam&#8217;s dream of eventually making the Airstream a self-propelled land yacht. (He foresaw a motorized portion that would detach from the mothership, like a dinghy.) It recalls the VW Microbus, and for that matter the Stout Scarab, a 1935 precursor to the minivan. Inside, the Ford concept car shifts its frame of reference to more distant travel. The materials and colors &#151; called &#8220;cosmic red and white&#8221; &#151; were inspired by the spacecraft in the 1968 film &#8220;2001: A Space Odyssey.&#8221; Space buffs will recall another connection between space travel and Airstream. In 1969, upon their return from the moon, the Apollo 11 astronauts were quartered inside a modified Airstream called the mobile quarantine facility. They remained in the silver pod for three weeks; President visited and waved at the astronauts through the window.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 15, 2007 FRED KANTER deserves a lifetime pass to the New York auto show. Skip to next paragraph Those most taken by the 789 can order their own for $135,000. His first trip to the show, in 1958, was the pilgrimage of “a car-struck 13-year-old” from New Jersey, Mr. Kanter recalled in a recent interview. “Shortly after a friend and I arrived by train from Morris Plains, I was transfixed by the Dual-Ghia 400 concept on display,” he said. “It was absolutely breathtaking, very imaginative and the most stunning car I’d ever seen.” The car had been created as a design study by Ghia, the Italian coachbuilder, for Dual Motors, a limited-edition car builder in Detroit. Dual-Ghias gained visibility with celebrity owners like and his Rat Pack pals. Alex Freeman, a New Jersey machine shop owner who had come to the auto show in search of a family car, was also moved by the Dual-Ghia 400. All thoughts of shopping for a new Ford or Chevy were swept aside by Mr. Freeman’s realization that he “must have that car.” Hearing that, his wife shuffled the couple’s eight-year-old daughter to another display, explaining that daddy needed time by himself. By the time Mrs. Freeman returned, her husband had convinced Gene Casaroll, president of Dual Motors, to sell the car on display for $15,000, at least twice the price of a new Cadillac. Delivery was postponed to let the car finish its tour of auto shows. Nearly 20 years later, Mr. Kanter heard that the concept car was for sale. A deal was struck the same day and by that evening, the dream machine was parked in the Kanter garage. Never intending to hide his prize, Mr. Kanter has often displayed the car in the classics section at the New York show. Gregg D. Merksamer, the show’s historian and author of “A History of the New York International Auto Show” (Lionheart Books, 2000) said he thought no other car had topped the Dual-Ghia’s number of appearances at the show. This year Mr. Kanter enjoyed the show — which ends today — from both sides of the velvet ropes, as a spectator and an exhibitor. His own design showcase, a two-seat convertible called the 789 that gathers up Chevrolet’s Greatest Hits of the 1950s, is displayed near the entrance to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The roadster, painted a brilliant two-tone blue, combines the front end of a ’57 Bel Air, the center of a ’58 Impala and the rear of a ’59. It drew crowds of gawkers, many of whom stopped for snapshots. And those most taken by the 789 are able to order their own — for $135,000, the new owners can have their 789 painted and trimmed to their liking. Mr. Kanter’s car, which can be seen at , is built on the chassis of a sixth-generation Corvette. It is 4 inches wider, 11 inches longer and 150 pounds heavier than a stock Corvette convertible. Building a few dozen 789s a year is merely the tip of Mr. Kanter’s iceberg. His main business is Kanter Auto Products, a source of hard-to-find parts for vintage cars in need of a replacement ball joint or brake drum. Mr. Kanter’s auto entrepreneurship began taking shape at age 15. While helping friends haul home a ’32 Plymouth for a hot-rod project, he spotted a ’37 Packard resting forlornly near a gas station in Branchville, N. J. When the $35 Plymouth deal fell through, the group’s interest shifted to the Packard, which had an asking price of $50. “Between us we had enough money for a deposit,” he said. “It wasn’t running, so we towed it home, fixed the engine and sold the spare parts stashed in its back seat for more than our initial investment.” While visiting dealers for the parts he needed to repair his Packard, Mr. Kanter learned that a hubcap might cost $8 and a door handle $12 but, since Packard had gone out of business, a dealer might have two truck loads of spare parts he would be happy to unload for $100. Every Packard dealer’s junk soon became Mr. Kanter’s gold. In 1960, he bought the parts inventory of a dealer in Henderson, Pa. Like a grapevine, his operations spread along the East Coast, then extended west to Detroit and beyond. While attending Lehigh University, where he earned degrees in industrial engineering and applied sciences, Fred and his brother Dan sold parts to the Packard needy using Fred’s college address. Various storage sites, including their parents’ basement, housed the inventory. Today, Mr. Kanter said, the vintage parts business is a $15 million operation with 65 employees and 150,000 square feet of warehouse space in Boonton, N.J. “We stock everything a Packard dealer would have offered from a clock hand to a new frame,” he said. “And we’re still buying inventory from anyone interested in disposing of their stock.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 8, 2007 LOOKING for America’s next top model? If you’re interested in something more substantial than underfed young women preening on television for a modeling contract, you’ll find plenty of candidates at the New York International Auto Show. Skip to next paragraph 2007 New York Auto Show: Must-See Cars Hip-hop impressario Funkmaster Flex with the Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition at the New York International Auto Show. From now through next Sunday, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center plays host to some beauties that show off their nicely proportioned wheels, bodacious bumpers and glittering grilles. As in any beauty pageant, contestants will be judged on their personality, poise, performance and sex appeal. Think of New York as the final elimination round in a series of competitions over the last four months at auto shows in Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and Geneva. The winners here advance to the true test: the showroom floors of America’s car dealerships. New York also provides a curtain call for popular performers from earlier shows, like the headline-grabbing (but so far nonfunctional) Chevrolet Volt hybrid electric car, which made its debut in January in Detroit. Sadly, another electrifying concept car, the retro Holden Efijy from Australia, a crowd favorite wherever it has gone, will not be displayed in New York. Also missing from a show attended by lots of high rollers will be the $1.4 million Bugatti Veyron 16.4. And, in perhaps the oddest omission in a city where drivers truly do think small, the tiny Smart cars that go on sale in the United States early next year skipped this show. Still, there are plenty of cars that deserve the attention of New Yorkers attending the show. Here are a dozen highlights: Hmmm. Ford hires Boeing guy as president. Ford announces new vehicle with seating for six. But relax: it’s not six across, with two middle seats and a center aisle for a drink cart. The 2008 Flex is a six-passenger people mover (a seventh seating position is available) based not on the Boeing 737, but on the Ford Fairlane concept car of 2005. This classy-looking crossover wagon is clearly a knock-off of vintage models from Ford’s Land Rover division. When Ford first showed the Fairlane at the 2005 Detroit auto show, the question was asked, “Will Ford build it?” My reply was, “Over Land Rover’s dead body.” That, it seems, was not a consideration. 2. FUNKMASTER FLEX FORD EXPEDITION Please don’t confuse this funked-out S.U.V. with the unfunky Flex crossover. The hip-hop impresario Funkmaster Flex actually introduced a nearly identical version of the Halloween-hued Flexmobile last November in Las Vegas, at the huge Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show for the aftermarket customizing industry. Flex’s Expedition is one of three customized limited editions that Ford is showing in New York. The two others are an F-150 pickup reimagined by the customizer Chip Foose and a 540-horsepower King of the Road Mustang, the Shelby GT500KR, finished by the racecar legend Carroll Shelby. 3. GMC YUKON HYBRID What’s new in environmentally friendly green machines at the auto show? Shockingly little, though General Motors is showing some new hydrids including the 2008 Yukon. This is G.M.’s first full-size S.U.V. hybrid, and it features a two-mode system developed in conjunction with DaimlerChrysler and BMW that results in a mild increase in mileage. The two-mode Yukon hybrid goes on sale late this year. The most intriguing electric car at the show may be one in the display of LeMay collection classics in a far corner downstairs. Look for the 1912 Standard Electric, a fully functional battery-powered runabout that would put many of today’s electric car concepts to shame. Hybrid hunters may be more successful outside the convention hall. This curbside exhibit, organized by the Design Trust for Public Space, demonstrates what the future may hold for the city’s bumblebee-colored taxi fleets. Taxi 07 is not a static display; the vehicles actually work, and in some cases make runs through Midtown. The exhibit features electric cars, gasoline-electric hybrids and taxis with special features for riders with limited mobility. And be sure to savor this bit of fantasy: the exhibit and the taxis are waiting daily, fair weather or foul — unlike cabs on the real streets of New York. Neither you nor your chauffeur may ever drive a 2008 Brooklands coupé (say COO-pay), but you can drool over it here.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 MOORESVILLE, N.C., May 10 — , the son of a legend and the most popular driver in , has put himself on the open market for 2008. His free agency will send ripples throughout the sport, potentially affecting driver salaries, merchandise sales and even television ratings, not to mention the balance of power among race teams. Skip to next paragraph Amy Conn/ Associated Press Dale Earnhardt, left, and his son Dale Jr., at Daytona International Speedway in 2001. Earnhardt Sr. died in a crash at Daytona that year. Earnhardt opened the door to all of that when he announced Thursday that he would leave Dale Earnhardt Inc. when his contract ends after this season. It was a stunning decision by Earnhardt, who has raced for his father’s team since his career began, winning 17 Cup races and two lower-level Busch Series championships. “At 32 years of age, the same as my father was when he made his final and most important career decision, it is time for me to compete on a consistent basis and contend for championships now,” Earnhardt said Thursday at a news conference at his JR Motorsports race shop. The announcement came after a year of negotiations that occasionally devolved into a public spat between Earnhardt and his stepmother, Teresa Earnhardt. She had taken over full ownership of the company after Dale Earnhardt died in a crash during the 2001 Daytona 500. It was Teresa Earnhardt’s stewardship, and Earnhardt’s belief that he could not win championships with D.E.I., that led to his departure. He has not won a race since May 6, 2006, and has only two victories since the start of 2005. “He needs to start winning again,” Humpy Wheeler, president of Lowe’s Motor Speedway and a longtime race promoter, said in a telephone interview. “He’s got to put himself in a position where he can win two or three races a year to keep that popularity, and he knows that. “Personalities drive all sports, and he is the most popular personality that we have. He accounts for a significant part of souvenir sales.” Maintaining that popularity will have an effect on everyone in the sport. “If Dale Jr. will wind up with a team that’s in contention to win races every week and contend for a championship, that’s got to help ticket sales at the gate, TV ratings, all those kinds of things,” Eddie Gossage, president of Texas Motor Speedway, said in a telephone interview. “It’s one of those things, a rising tide floats all boats.” Earnhardt is not the first Nascar driver to become a free agent. There are no rules limiting movement; it is relatively common for drivers to switch teams as contracts expire. But it is rare for a driver of Earnhardt’s stature, at the height of his career and popularity, to make himself available to other teams. to become a free agent. “A new paradigm has just been established in American motor sports,” Gossage wrote in an e-mail message. “Just as Andy Messersmith ushered in the era of modern-day free agency in major league baseball, Dale Jr. is establishing modern-day free agency in Nascar. Dale Jr. will now determine his full value on the open market and have the opportunity to make his own choices to put himself in a position to win races and championships. “Dale Jr.’s announcement is every bit as significant as A-Rod’s huge contract a few years back or ’s extraordinary contract signing last week with the Earnhardt said Thursday that this decision was not about money. He is looking to join a team that will help him win consistently. Kelley Earnhardt Elledge, Earnhardt’s sister and chief negotiator, said a number of teams had contacted them in recent months to express interest. They hope to have a deal done in 60 days, she said later. Earnhardt said he would listen to all offers but would work to remain with a Chevrolet team. Three Chevrolet teams are at the top of the sport: Hendrick Motorsports, Joe Gibbs Racing and Richard Childress Racing. Hendrick, though, has contracts with , Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch and Casey Mears and has sponsors through at least 2008. Nascar rules limit each owner to four drivers. Gibbs and Childress have three drivers apiece, but if Budweiser remains an Earnhardt sponsor that could be a problem. Gibbs does not want to be involved with an alcohol sponsorship and Childress has one with Jack Daniels, creating a conflict. “I think most everyone out there would say, ‘Yeah, he’d be a great fit here,’ ” J. D. Gibbs, president of Joe Gibbs Racing, said in a telephone interview. “I think for us, we’re just focusing kind of on what we’re doing now. Obviously he’s a big part of our sport, I think he could do about whatever he wants to do.” Earnhardt’s father won six of his seven championships for Childress. But Earnhardt would hesitate to drive the racecar that his father made famous. “I’ve got to do a little soul searching about how I feel about driving the No. 3 car,” he said. Earnhardt did not rule out driving a different racecar for Childress, though. He also could create a Cup team for JR Motorsports, although that is not the No. 1 option. Wherever he goes, the greatest impact could ultimately be felt at Dale Earnhardt Inc., which is losing the sport’s most marketable driver. “Well, the most classic statement that I’ve heard, and it came from : ‘What’s D.E.I. without Dale Jr.? A museum,’ ” said the three-time Cup champion Darrell Waltrip, who attended the news conference. “And that’s a pretty good analogy, I would say.” More Articles in Sports &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Press, to be the first non-Japanese to sit on the automaker’s board. Skip to next paragraph Fabrizio Costantini for the New York Times Managing Globalization Blog: Labor Finds a Way to Globalize The move comes amid concerns at Toyota over political resentment in the United States, where Japanese carmakers have prospered while the American producers struggle. It also reflects the efforts of Toyota, a solidly Japanese company, to become more international these days, as it produces and sells more vehicles overseas than in Japan. The changes announced on Thursday would increase the number of board members to 30 from 25. Mr. Press, 60, was among nine new directors appointed. Four members retired, including the executive vice president, Yoshimi Inaba, a popular executive who had led Toyota’s important China operations for two years. The changes are subject to approval by a meeting of shareholders in June, the company said. In addition to his new board seat, Mr. Press was promoted to senior managing director, an executive post in the Japanese parent company just two rungs below Toyota’s president, Katsuaki Watanabe. Mr. Press is also the first non-Japanese to advance to this level in Toyota’s 72-year history, the company said. His promotion came after years of discussion at Toyota about whether to name Americans, Europeans and other non-Japanese to its board. In the last few years, sales outside Japan have far outstripped those at home, but the makeup of the board did not reflect that. About four years ago, Toyota created the senior managing director post as a first step toward giving more authority to non-Japanese, short of board seats. Mr. Press is to join a board with 29 other members, most of whom have spent their entire careers at Toyota. He joined Toyota from in 1970, when the Japanese automaker sold just over 200,000 cars in the United States, all imported from Japan. Last year, it was the third-largest seller of autos in the United States, behind Mr. Press rose through the ranks of the company’s North American sales subsidiary, where he was known for close ties with dealers. He took over as president of Toyota’s North American operations last year after his predecessor, a Japanese executive, resigned after being named in a sexual-harassment lawsuit. The suit was settled, and the executive later retired. If any American executive was to be named to the board, the most likely candidate was Mr. Press, senior Toyota executives have said. They characterized him as having the best understanding of any American executive of the company’s corporate culture, which stresses a long-term view, employee involvement, adherence to Toyota’s manufacturing process and continuous improvement. Mr. Press has taken a more visible role in the American operations over the last year. Last month, he testified to Congress alongside executives from Detroit automakers, with legislation under consideration that would raise fuel-economy standards to as much as 40 miles a gallon, from the current 27.5. And in February, he spoke to the Economic Club of Chicago, where he stressed the company’s interest in the environment. Toyota has built market share in the United States with fuel-efficient vehicles like the Camry and Corolla sedans at a time when the American producers have been closing factories and laying off workers. Its success has prompted some Toyota executives to express concern about possible trade problems with Washington.

Press, to be the first non-Japanese to sit on the automaker’s board. Skip to next paragraph Fabrizio Costantini for the New York Times Managing Globalization Blog: Labor Finds a Way to Globalize The move comes amid concerns at Toyota over political resentment in the United States, where Japanese carmakers have prospered while the American producers struggle. It also reflects the efforts of Toyota, a solidly Japanese company, to become more international these days, as it produces and sells more vehicles overseas than in Japan. The changes announced on Thursday would increase the number of board members to 30 from 25. Mr. Press, 60, was among nine new directors appointed. Four members retired, including the executive vice president, Yoshimi Inaba, a popular executive who had led Toyota’s important China operations for two years. The changes are subject to approval by a meeting of shareholders in June, the company said. In addition to his new board seat, Mr. Press was promoted to senior managing director, an executive post in the Japanese parent company just two rungs below Toyota’s president, Katsuaki Watanabe. Mr. Press is also the first non-Japanese to advance to this level in Toyota’s 72-year history, the company said. His promotion came after years of discussion at Toyota about whether to name Americans, Europeans and other non-Japanese to its board. In the last few years, sales outside Japan have far outstripped those at home, but the makeup of the board did not reflect that. About four years ago, Toyota created the senior managing director post as a first step toward giving more authority to non-Japanese, short of board seats. Mr. Press is to join a board with 29 other members, most of whom have spent their entire careers at Toyota. He joined Toyota from in 1970, when the Japanese automaker sold just over 200,000 cars in the United States, all imported from Japan. Last year, it was the third-largest seller of autos in the United States, behind Mr. Press rose through the ranks of the company’s North American sales subsidiary, where he was known for close ties with dealers. He took over as president of Toyota’s North American operations last year after his predecessor, a Japanese executive, resigned after being named in a sexual-harassment lawsuit. The suit was settled, and the executive later retired. If any American executive was to be named to the board, the most likely candidate was Mr. Press, senior Toyota executives have said. They characterized him as having the best understanding of any American executive of the company’s corporate culture, which stresses a long-term view, employee involvement, adherence to Toyota’s manufacturing process and continuous improvement.

Due Diligence May Tell - New York Times Authentic, or Expert Fake? Due Diligence May Tell It is an Auto Union D-type, just not the one that won the French Grand Prix. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 EYEBROWS rose in the collector car world early this year when Christie’s announced that an important Grand Prix racecar from the 1930s — with the potential to become the most expensive car ever sold at auction, Christie’s said — would be offered at the Retromobile exhibition in Paris. Presale publicity from the auction house set high expectations, anticipating bids from $12 million to $15 million, which would easily top the $8.7 million price of a Bugatti Royale sold in 1987. Skip to next paragraph Canada Clings to an Old Ford The racecar was a 12-cylinder Auto Union D-type, one of about 20 built by the German car company that included Audi. Initial research indicated it was chassis No. 21, the winner of the 1939 French Grand Prix. But before the February auction took place, Christie’s, working with Audi Tradition, keeper of the automaker’s historic records, determined it was actually chassis No. 19. That car competed in the 1939 race, but rather than winning, it finished sixth with Hans Stuck behind the wheel. Christie’s disclosed the findings and withdrew the car from the sale. A specialist for Christie’s, Christopher Sanger, said, “While we were disappointed to not publicly sell the D-type because of the provenance, we take these issues very seriously; fortunately, we got it right.” That the history of even such a well-researched car could prove wrong points out the challenges facing buyers of vintage cars. While the Auto Union situation did not involve any intent to deceive a buyer, increasing values of collector cars create a temptation for unscrupulous sellers to misrepresent their offerings. That’s where the experts come in. “This has been a problem for years with racecars and many of the classics,” says Deane Fehrman of Golden, Colo., an automobile appraiser and a Fellow of the American Society of Appraisers. “With racecars, it’s tough to tell if what you have is what ran the race,” Mr. Fehrman said, referring to the many changes in equipment that can happen over a racecar’s competitive life. Numbers, if used at all, were mostly just internal ways of keeping inventory, and not identifiers of individual vehicles. As in the world of fine art, the most elaborate attempts to misrepresent cars occur where the profit potential is greatest. That was the case with a Ferrari sold by Lord Brockett, a British collector who got involved in the heady world of Ferrari sales in the 1980s, when rising prices seemed destined to continue. Lord Brockett commissioned a reproduction of a Ferrari 250 SWB, or short wheel base, to be built on the chassis of a far less valuable 250 GTE 2+2, and to hide the fraud the car was given the serial number of a long-missing 250 SWB. The legitimate car later turned up; Lord Brockett ended up in jail for a variety of offenses, including an insurance scheme involving five cars he had cut up and buried on the family estate. He is now a motivational speaker. Such forgeries may be getting harder to conceal. Ferrari has recently instituted a program, Ferrari Certificato di Identificazione, which issues a heritage certificate. Owners can have details of their cars’ originality verified, including factory options and in many cases, the original owner or seller. Other automakers are providing help with finding out if a car is what it purports to be, or at least what it was when it was built. This is particularly useful for American cars of the 1960s and ’70s. The availability of used and reproduction parts makes it relatively easy for an unscrupulous seller to create a clone, or replica, muscle car from a more common model — which is, of course, exactly what automakers did in making a car like the Pontiac GTO from a Tempest. Pontiac Historic Services maintains copies of factory records for many of its early products. It can provide Pontiac owners or prospective buyers with a copy of the factory invoice or billing history for their specific car as well as a letter that translates the factory option codes. For Dodge, Plymouth, Chrysler and De Soto vehicles, the DaimlerChrysler Corporate Historical Collection in Detroit has information on many individual cars built between 1930 and 1967.

Brower/Bloomberg News Alan R. Mulally, left, Ford&#146;s chief executive, conferred with William Clay Ford, the executive chairman, at the annual shareholders&#146; meeting. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WILMINGTON, Del., May 10 &#151; A group of shareholders took turns blaming the company&#8217;s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr. , at the annual meeting Thursday, criticizing every decision he made as the former chief executive except one. That was his decision last September to hire a executive, Alan R. Mulally, as his successor. Mr. Mulally, 61, a boyish-looking aeronautical engineer who worked for Boeing for 37 years and rose to become its senior vice president, was widely credited with rescuing its commercial airline division from its economic troubles after the events of 9/11. &#8220;Alan knows what it&#8217;s like to have your back to the wall, and fight your way out with a well-conceived plan and great execution,&#8221; Mr. Ford has said. Now Ford has its back to the wall, with a $12.7 billion loss in 2006, seven consecutive quarterly losses and a shrinking market share. Mr. Mulally, alternating between empathy with shareholder concerns and optimism for the company&#8217;s &#8220;Way Forward&#8221; recovery plan, urged the 79 shareholders who gathered for the meeting at the Hotel du Pont to have patience, and promised results &#8220;in the months and the years ahead.&#8221; &#8220;We are moving quickly and making real progress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s going to take time to turn things around.&#8221; The automaker, based in Detroit, has borrowed $23.5 billion to help finance accelerated product development and a reduction in operating costs that includes closing 16 plants and eliminating 44,000 jobs by 2012. A provision of the loan, which is secured by assets that include the company&#8217;s trademark blue oval logo, effectively bars Ford from paying dividends until 2013 or until the loan is paid off, a spokeswoman, Becky Sanch, said. Shareholders voting by proxy re-elected the 12 current board members with 95.9 percent of the votes cast. All seven shareholder proposals failed, including those calling for a reduction in greenhouse gases, performance-based compensation for executives and health care as a fiduciary duty. But support increased for a proposal to extinguish the Ford family&#8217;s 40 percent voting control through their supervoting shares by recapitalizing all outstanding stock to one vote per share. The proposal won 27.4 percent of the vote this year, up from 22.9 percent in 2006. After the meeting, Mr. Mulally told reporters that as a global company, Ford was &#8220;absolutely supporting free trade,&#8221; notwithstanding the increasing market share in North America of its rival Toyota. He also acknowledged that there would be industry consolidation because of market overcapacity. When asked if there had been talk of a merger at Ford, Ms. Sanch said, &#8220;There has been a lot of speculation. But it&#8217;s nothing we&#8217;re interested in. We&#8217;re focused on turning around our business, not on any type of merger or acquisition.&#8221; She said she knew of no contact from a potential buyer.

We have major banks lined up.&#8221; He did not say how much the partnership&#8217;s bid was worth, but whatever its value, it would not require Magna to take on debt. &#8220;Keep in mind we have $2 billion of cash,&#8221; Mr. Stronach said after the meeting of the company, Magna Entertainment, in Toronto. &#8220;I would not gamble Magna away.&#8221; Speculation about a Magna-Onex bid has been circulating for several weeks. The confirmation of the offer will probably prompt shareholder questions at Magna International&#8217;s annual meeting on Thursday in Toronto. Mr. Stronach said that Onex and Magna want DaimlerChrysler to maintain a stake in the Chrysler unit, and he added that the two companies might include other partners in their bid. Chrysler is the most important customer of Magna, which is based north of Toronto in Aurora, Ontario. The companies have an unusually close relationship. Magna, for example, engineers and makes the interiors of Chrysler&#8217;s minivans and operates the paint shop at one of Chrysler&#8217;s assembly plants in Toledo. In Austria, Magna builds complete vehicles for Chrysler and other companies including BMW, the Mercedes unit of DaimlerChrysler and the Saab unit of When Magna was having financial difficulties in the 1990s, Chrysler extended both formal and informal assistance to keep the company going. Mr. Stronach said that he anticipated that DaimlerChrysler would reply to the offer within weeks. &#8220;As far as we know, we&#8217;re still part of the picture; we&#8217;re still a contender,&#8221; Mr. Stronach said. Reports have said that two private equity firms, Cerberus Capital Management and the Blackstone Group, have also made bids for Chrysler although neither company has commented on them. Tracinda, the investment vehicle of the billionaire , announced a $4.5 billion offer for Chrysler in early April. A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, Mike Aberlich, said the company would not comment on the possible sale of Chrysler &#8220;until the process runs its course.&#8221; Onex did not respond to a request for comment. It has recently successfully acquired, revamped and taken public some aviation component plants once owned by While Magna has twice developed prototype automobiles that it hoped to produce for a fully integrated manufacturer, the company has no experience when it comes to marketing to consumers or dealing with dealers. In addition, Mr. Stronach&#8217;s corporate strategy runs somewhat contrary to that of Chrysler. His company is generally based on operating large numbers of small factories rather than the large plants that make up Chrysler. If his bid wins, Mr. Stronach suggested that Chrysler would have to cut back even more than it has previously announced. &#8220;Sometimes when you&#8217;re sick you&#8217;ve got to take some drastic measures,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What do we have to do to create a healthy patient?&#8221; Chrysler lost about $1.5 billion in 2006 and has already announced a recovery plan that includes eliminating 13,000 jobs in the United States and Canada. Magna&#8217;s net income last year was $528 million, and it employs about 82,000 people. Johannes Van Biesebroeck, a University of Toronto economist who studies the auto industry, said that Magna&#8217;s interest in Chrysler probably stemmed from its self-interest. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure for now they just want it to remain viable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They want to be around when things are happening.&#8221; Next Article in Automobiles (12 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 29, 2007 AT the moment, hydrogen seems to be the most practical way to power vehicles that do not emit carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas. But despite considerable research, many hurdles remain. Here are some questions and answers: Skip to next paragraph From Point A to Point B by Way of H Comparing Six Hydrogen Vehicles Where does hydrogen come from? Hydrogen, an odorless, colorless gas, is the lightest and most plentiful element in the universe. It is found in water and in most organic matter, but it is usually bound with other elements. For that reason, it is called an energy carrier, meaning that energy has to be expended to extract it. But can’t it be burned in an engine? Fuels like coal, natural gas or oil can be taken from the ground and used with relatively little energy-intensive processing. But hydrogen must be turned into a fuel — and because it takes so much energy to produce, it should not be thought of as a direct replacement for fuels like gasoline. Rather, it is energy in a portable form, somewhat akin to electricity. Because aside from being plentiful, it is very clean. Cars running on hydrogen produce very little tailpipe pollution and no greenhouse gases — they leave only a trail of water. In this way, cars running on fuel cells — which produce electricity by a chemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen — would produce no tailpipe emissions. What is hydrogen used for today? It has several uses. About nine million tons of hydrogen are produced annually in the United States, mostly for chemical production, petroleum refining and metal treatment. What is the cost of a unit of hydrogen with the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline? That question has many answers. Hydrogen is certainly expensive to produce now, with costs somewhat dependent on the source material. A kilogram of hydrogen has about the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline, but hydrogen proponents point out that fuel cells can have double or triple the efficiency of gasoline engines. Hydrogen is most commonly produced by a process called steam reforming, which extracts the hydrogen from natural gas. The cost of natural gas reforming, which has been the cheapest method, has been affected by the rising price of natural gas. A kilo of hydrogen produced by steam reforming costs from $4 to $8 today. It can also be made by electrolysis, which separates water into hydrogen and oxygen. The cost of hydrogen produced from water is tied to the price of electricity, which fluctuates by region and by type of generation. If grid electricity sold for 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, hydrogen could be produced through electrolysis for $3 per gallon equivalent. But electricity is typically 10 to 14 cents today, so electrolytic hydrogen from grid electricity is often $6 per gallon equivalent or more. These high costs make hydrogen generated from renewable electricity sources like wind farms or solar power more attractive. A federal National Renewable Energy Laboratory report in February estimated that a kilogram of hydrogen could be produced for $3.63 using solar power and for $3.10 using wind. “The solar technology is promising, but it won’t happen quickly,” said Robert D. McConnell of the laboratory’s solar energy program. Can nuclear power be a source of inexpensive hydrogen? Yes. Dr. Kenneth R. Schultz, operations director of the energy group at General Atomics, a research and development firm in San Diego, said that by 2025 the nuclear industry could be able to produce hydrogen for $1.50 to $2 a kilogram. But Amory B. Lovins, chairman and chief scientist at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization in Snowmass, Colo., described both the process and the price as “aspirational.” How will we use hydrogen in a motor vehicle? There are several options. In the most common prediction, compressed hydrogen gas is stored in a reinforced tank aboard a car, then fed to a fuel cell. The cell is not an engine, but a small chemical factory that converts the pressurized gas to electricity, which runs an electric motor. The only emission is water. Liquid hydrogen offers excellent energy density per volume, but it would have to be carried in cryogenic tanks because hydrogen doesn’t liquefy until it reaches minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. Metal hydrides offer an opportunity to store hydrogen in solid form, but such a system is heavy and therefore reduces the vehicle’s travel range.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 29, 2007 Skip to next paragraph The Future of Hydrogen Comparing Six Hydrogen Vehicles WHEN the largest aircraft ever built — the pride of Nazi Germany — crashed in flames at the United States Navy’s airship base here, it took 36 lives and smeared the reputation of hydrogen for decades. In less than a minute, the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 turned hydrogen, which provided the zeppelin’s lift, into a pariah. But 70 years later, a growing number of advocates are promoting hydrogen as a panacea, a promising alternative to petroleum. In the last decade, every large carmaker has jumped on the hydrogen express. In dozens of laboratories and research centers, scientists and engineers are busy searching for ways to reduce the cost and improve the practicality of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Development has progressed to the point that some of these prototype vehicles are in daily service, commuting around Detroit, delivering packages in Washington, serving urban bus routes. To look in on the development progress of hydrogen vehicles, The New York Times invited 10 companies actively promoting hydrogen for personal transportation to bring their vehicles to the Naval Air Engineering Station here. With pressure mounting to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, the anniversary of a pivotal event 70 years ago seemed an appropriate time to look for a clearer understanding of what cars may be like in 30 years. Some carmakers deemed the disaster site an awkward location for this gathering; others were sympathetic but unable to field a vehicle because experimental mules have testing and appearance schedules busier than those of presidential hopefuls. The three hydrogen-powered vehicles that did arrive here (all by trailer, because refueling was not available for the long trips from their bases) were not the latest models from the auto show circuit, but hard-working development vehicles with thousands of testing miles on their odometers. Weather was also a factor. The day of the gathering was fraught by a severe northeaster. Six inches of rain was followed by flooded roads and snow, as the winds blew and angry skies frowned. But the show went on, thanks in part to the hosts at the base and the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society. The Hindenburg anniversary is not the only reason hydrogen is in the news. Four years ago, in his State of the Union address, President Bush announced a $1.2 billion hydrogen initiative to foster clean air and lessen dependence on imported oil. The Department of Energy has conducted marriages of sorts, joining automakers with energy companies — General Motors and Shell; Ford and DaimlerChrysler with BP — to encourage research and set standards for refueling hardware. As hydrogen gains favor, hydrocarbons seem to be taking over the role of villain. Peak oil theorists, especially Matthew Simmons, chairman of the Simmons & Company investment bank and the author of “Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy” contend that increased demand will outpace the ability to increase production. And the Supreme Court’s April 2 ruling that the E.P.A. has authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, as it does tailpipe emissions, was a powerful vote against fossil fuels. So the three hydrogen-fueled vehicles that gathered at the Hindenburg crash site are harbingers of the future, proof that all of hydrogen’s potential in transportation did not go up in flames 70 years ago. The spot where the Hindenburg met its end is now a historic landmark. A heavy yellow anchor chain surrounds a concrete pad replicating the size, shape, and final resting place of the Hindenburg’s control car. Rick Zitarosa, historian of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, said the Navy intended to preserve the site in its current form. The vehicles here, and three other experimental cars driven elsewhere, cover a broad spectrum of hydrogen possibilities. Here are highlights: Ford regards hydrogen-fueled internal-combustion engines as “a bridge to fuel cells, the powertrain of the future.” Teamed with BP, Ford built a fleet of 30 E-450 shuttle buses.

But the show went on, thanks in part to the hosts at the base and the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society. The Hindenburg anniversary is not the only reason hydrogen is in the news. Four years ago, in his State of the Union address, President Bush announced a $1.2 billion hydrogen initiative to foster clean air and lessen dependence on imported oil. The Department of Energy has conducted marriages of sorts, joining automakers with energy companies — General Motors and Shell; Ford and DaimlerChrysler with BP — to encourage research and set standards for refueling hardware. As hydrogen gains favor, hydrocarbons seem to be taking over the role of villain. Peak oil theorists, especially Matthew Simmons, chairman of the Simmons & Company investment bank and the author of “Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy” contend that increased demand will outpace the ability to increase production. And the Supreme Court’s April 2 ruling that the E.P.A. has authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, as it does tailpipe emissions, was a powerful vote against fossil fuels. So the three hydrogen-fueled vehicles that gathered at the Hindenburg crash site are harbingers of the future, proof that all of hydrogen’s potential in transportation did not go up in flames 70 years ago. The spot where the Hindenburg met its end is now a historic landmark. A heavy yellow anchor chain surrounds a concrete pad replicating the size, shape, and final resting place of the Hindenburg’s control car. Rick Zitarosa, historian of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, said the Navy intended to preserve the site in its current form. The vehicles here, and three other experimental cars driven elsewhere, cover a broad spectrum of hydrogen possibilities. Here are highlights: Ford regards hydrogen-fueled internal-combustion engines as “a bridge to fuel cells, the powertrain of the future.” Teamed with BP, Ford built a fleet of 30 E-450 shuttle buses.

Mulally, did both on Monday. Speaking with journalists in a conference call, Mr. Mulally said, &#8220;I clearly believe the vast majority of data indicates that the temperature has increased. And I believe the correlation and analysis that it&#8217;s mainly because of greenhouse gases.&#8221; His comments came as Mr. Mulally announced a promotion for a Ford vice president, Susan M. Cischke, to a new job as senior vice president for sustainability, environment and safety engineering. Ms. Cischke, who now reports to Mr. Mulally instead of to Ford&#8217;s Washington office, will be in charge of creating a long-range strategy on sustainability matters. The first executive at a Detroit auto company to have sustainability in her job title, she previously was vice president of environmental and safety engineering. She becomes the highest-ranking woman at Ford and the latest executive to take on an expanded role since Mr. Mulally became chief executive in September. The auto industry is facing the likelihood that it will be forced to make cars and trucks that achieve better gasoline mileage. On April 2 the Supreme Court ruled that the had the authority to regulate carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from automobiles. The primary way that can be done, carmakers and environmentalists say, is to increase automobile fuel economy. As a result, Detroit carmakers, which have a long history of fighting regulations, are saying they want an active role in the movement to reduce the damage vehicles do to the environment. They may have little choice: lawmakers have introduced measures in Congress to raise federal fuel economy standards to as high as 40 miles a gallon, from the current standard of 27.5 miles a gallon for cars and 24 miles a gallon for light trucks. Likewise, the Bush administration is proposing a series of steps on the environment that include raising fuel economy by about one mile a gallon each year over the next few years. &#8220;We can have it if we all work together,&#8221; Mr. Mulally said Monday. Ford has previously tried to position itself as an environmentally conscious company, especially when Mr. Mulally&#8217;s predecessor, William Clay Ford Jr. , was in charge, only to pull back on promises of building more efficient vehicles. For example, it abandoned a pledge, made in 2000, to improve the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent by 2005. Last year Ford gave up on plans to sell 250,000 hybrid-electric vehicles each year by the end of the decade, saying instead that it would place greater emphasis on developing vehicles that can run on fuels other than gasoline, like E85, a mix of ethanol and gasoline. Mr. Mulally acknowledged that Ford had made those vows before it had the technology to achieve them. &#8220;On one hand, you have to give Ford credit for being a leader and for being out front originally,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On the other side, we&#8217;re just seeing another recommitment of Ford that this is really important and we&#8217;re going to make it a high priority of the company.&#8221; Representatives of environmental groups said that they were glad to see Mr. Mulally&#8217;s latest steps but had not forgotten Ford&#8217;s record. &#8220;It&#8217;s always good when we see a company making steps toward becoming more environmentally sustainable,&#8221; said Mike Hudema, director of the Freedom From Oil Campaign, an alliance of three environmental groups. &#8220;But we do always have to put that in context with Ford&#8217;s history,&#8221; he said, &#8220;which unfortunately on the environmental front is not a very good one.&#8221; Dan Becker, director of the global warming program at the , said Ford was good at making promises to help the environment but &#8220;when it comes to doing them they seem to forget or fall down on the job.&#8221; He questioned whether Ms. Cischke was the right executive to focus on sustainability, saying that she had testified before Congress opposing steps the Sierra Club had proposed. &#8220;It&#8217;s as if the Yankees promoted manager to reach out to the Red Sox,&#8221; he said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/automobiles/autoreviews/13BLOCK.html	Review - Lincoln MKX - Test Drive - New York Times MKX: Beyond the Edge Ford&#146;s American luxury division finally gets a crossover wagon. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 WHILE Cadillac has staged a respectable revival of late, times are still tough for Lincoln, the other venerable American luxury line. Skip to next paragraph The X Files: Four Luxury Crossovers Lincoln had its last bona fide hit, the Navigator sport utility, nearly a decade ago. In the years since, it has posted a lineup that could confirm the existence of chaos theory. The bizarre Blackwood pickup for 2002 was dead on arrival — appropriate, since it came only in black and featured what appeared to be a powered coffin lid over a carpeted bed. Failing to take the hint, Lincoln brought out another luxury pickup, the Mark LT, which has also underperformed in the showroom. On the sport utility front, Lincoln cobbled together the Aviator for 2002. It was basically a Ford Explorer with a deluxe interior, but at a price above $45,000, few left the hangar. Beyond its price, the Aviator’s failing — and Lincoln’s, too — was to miss the crossover wave. Models like the Lexus RX, now the perennial top seller among luxury sport utilities, were really cars underneath. By and large, Americans have discovered in recent years that they prefer crossovers to truck-centric models like the Aviator. Better late than never, Lincoln now paddles in with its first crossover: the MKX, not to be confused with Acura’s competing MDX — or with Lincoln’s own MKZ, a sedan formerly known as the Zephyr, or its yet-to-come MKS. (Chaos also rules the Lincoln’s naming department.) Based on the Ford Edge and Mazda CX-9, the five-passenger MKX is vastly more flightworthy than the Aviator. It is competent and quite striking. It starts at $36,445 including optional all-wheel drive, far less than other luxury models of its size: about $3,000 below the Lexus RX 350, about $4,000 less than the Acura, about $7,000 below a Mercedes ML350. But let’s be honest. The MKX may impress price shoppers and Lincoln loyalists, or people who remember where they were when Barry Goldwater got the Republican nomination. But it is less likely to impress people who have forged lasting relationships with rich foreigners, like the sport wagons from Lexus, Mercedes and BMW. No doubt, the Lincoln wins some style points: The MKX has an aerodynamic shape that even the Jetsons might like, and a wall-to-wall chrome grille that adds some visual sizzle. It’s a handsome ride. The interior is reasonably comfortable, though the front seats were handicapped by a short, hard bottom cushion. A central touch screen smoothly controls the audio system, navigation unit and other functions. (Lincoln could teach BMW and Mercedes a thing or two about user-friendly electronics.) An enormous sunroof is part of a $4,795 package that includes the navigation system, satellite radio and THX audio system. The MKX’s sharply angled windshield resulted in distracting reflections from vents atop the dashboard. But the gauges may be the biggest faux pas; did anyone at Lincoln notice how cheap they look? They’re penciled in a wispy, almost girlish font that recalls a J. C. Penney circular. The Lincoln’s neatest feature may be the dual buttons in the hatch area that drop the split 60-40 rear seats flat in a one-finger operation. There is useful storage back there, though the stylishly sloping roof reduces the ultimate capacity: both the Acura and Lexus have about 20 percent more space with the rear seats folded. On the road, the MKX is smooth, solid and quiet. But it drives like, well, a nice minivan, and I’d wager that a Honda Odyssey could beat it around a road course. Of course, the MKX is a prettified Ford Edge, and like that crossover wagon it feels rather large and unwieldy. Compared with the Ford, the Lincoln’s suspension is biased toward a comfortable ride, so it is tuned like a baby’s mashed potatoes: soft, messy and poorly controlled. The steering traces the right path, but the feel is vague and muffled. The 3.5-liter V-6, the new go-to engine for multiple Ford models, puts out a healthy 265 horsepower and 250 pound-feet of maximum torque. The six-speed automatic transmission is decently smooth, though the lack of manual-shift ability is another clue to the Lincoln’s easy-cruising intentions. The MKX also tips the scales at 4,420 pounds, one reason for a somewhat leisurely 8.1-second run from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. Yet despite the mass, the federal fuel economy rating is an impressive 17 miles a gallon in town, 24 on the highway, with all-wheel drive. (Front-drive models are rated 1 m.p.g. higher in town and country.) Braking is less impressive, though, as proved in testing by Car and Driver. The magazine recorded a 197-foot stop from 70 m.p.h., near the bottom in the class. The Lincoln weighs about 100 pounds less than the longer, wider Acura, and 300 less than a Mercedes M-Class. But the Acura, with its terrific suspension and performance-tuned all-wheel-drive system, feels like a nimble sport sedan in comparison — without any tradeoffs in ride or roominess. The Acura isn’t the only one: a homegrown rival, the Cadillac SRX, pioneered an adaptive magnetically controlled suspension that has been adopted by super sports cars like the Chevrolet Corvette, Ferrari 599 GTB and Audi R8. As you might expect, the Cadillac outhandles the Lincoln. In the MKX’s defense, the Lexus RX is no barn burner, either. And again, the Lincoln undercuts the competition: stuffed with options, my test car checked in at $43,890. Skeptics will note that the Lincoln’s stablemate, the Ford Edge, has a base price about $8,800 lower. They may well dismiss the Lincoln as an overpriced Ford. But people who love the Lincoln’s looks, and value smoothness over sport, may prefer to call the MKX a bargain Lexus.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/automobiles/18auto.html	G.M. Says It Will Make More Vehicles and Buy More Parts in India - New York Times G.M. Says It Will Make More Vehicles and Buy More Parts in India Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 18, 2007 NEW DELHI, April 17 — has big plans in India. Skip to next paragraph Rick Wagoner, chief executive of General Motors, announced Tuesday in New Delhi that the company would sell the Chevrolet Spark in India. In a visit to New Delhi on Tuesday, G.M.’s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, hailed the country’s thrifty manufacturing culture and growing car market and said the company would significantly increase purchasing and production here. In an interview, Mr. Wagoner said that G.M. planned to create a “local base” in India, a move that he said would not affect United States jobs. The company also introduced a new model into the Indian market on Tuesday, a compact hatchback priced at about $7,400. Car sales in India are growing about 15 percent a year, a rate projected to continue for the next five years, with low-cost cars making up the bulk of the sales. G.M. and other big automakers, hoping to offset slumping North American operations, are increasingly looking to India. In the past, the country has generally taken a back seat to China, but a growing middle class and new manufacturing prowess have made India popular for joint ventures and investments. G.M. expects India to be the second-fastest-growing car market in the world, after China, over the next 10 years. “It’s time to redouble our efforts on our manufacturing and market presence here,” Mr. Wagoner told government ministers and auto industry executives in a conference on the Indian auto industry. Mr. Wagoner said G.M. planned to take advantage of India’s high-quality, low-cost supply base “to source more parts out of India.” In a statement issued after his presentation, Mr. Wagoner said the sourcing increase could be “as much as fivefold over the next two years.” Analysts said that might translate into G.M.’s buying as much as $1 billion worth of car parts in India annually, which would be the most spent by a foreign automaker in India. In a brief interview after the conference, Mr. Wagoner said that the increased sourcing of car parts from India would not affect United States jobs because the components in question are not made in America. He would not specify which parts would come from India in the future. Given the growth of G.M.’s manufacturing in Asia, a company base in India would provide new opportunities for Indian suppliers, he said, Indian manufacturing costs are already “extremely competitive and among the lowest in the world,” Mr. Wagoner said during the conference. That is “not just due to lower wage rates,” he said. “It is also a function of the Indian mentality that abhors waste — because people cannot afford to throw things away.” Mr. Wagoner said G.M. would more than double its production capacity in India, to 225,000 vehicles a year, by making more vehicles at its Halol factory in the state of Gujarat and building a new plant in Talegaon, Maharashtra, both in western India. India has been trying to become Asia’s low-cost car manufacturing center, offering tax breaks and other incentives. Renault and Nissan announced plans in January to work with an Indian company to build a new car plant. Local analysts and manufacturing executives say India has a quality advantage over China. “The Chinese are known to manufacture very cheap cars, but the problem is that safety and emission norms are something they don’t meet,” said Kapil Singh, an auto analyst with Brics Securities, a brokerage house in Mumbai. Indian standards are as good as any in the world, he said. G.M.’s North American operations lost $4.6 billion in 2006, including about $3.8 billion that it spent on buyouts and other one-time items. Profit margins are also weakening in China, G.M.’s second-largest market, as competition lowers car prices. The new car G.M. will sell in India, the Chevrolet Spark, will be its smallest car in India. The other two G.M. models there cost significantly more, and sales are sluggish. “G.M. has a long way to go in India,” said Mr. Singh. “They haven’t been in the mainstream car business yet.” Next Article in Automobiles (30 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Says It Will Make More Vehicles and Buy More Parts in India Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 18, 2007 NEW DELHI, April 17 — has big plans in India. Skip to next paragraph Rick Wagoner, chief executive of General Motors, announced Tuesday in New Delhi that the company would sell the Chevrolet Spark in India. In a visit to New Delhi on Tuesday, G.M.’s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, hailed the country’s thrifty manufacturing culture and growing car market and said the company would significantly increase purchasing and production here. In an interview, Mr. Wagoner said that G.M. planned to create a “local base” in India, a move that he said would not affect United States jobs. The company also introduced a new model into the Indian market on Tuesday, a compact hatchback priced at about $7,400. Car sales in India are growing about 15 percent a year, a rate projected to continue for the next five years, with low-cost cars making up the bulk of the sales. G.M. and other big automakers, hoping to offset slumping North American operations, are increasingly looking to India. In the past, the country has generally taken a back seat to China, but a growing middle class and new manufacturing prowess have made India popular for joint ventures and investments. G.M. expects India to be the second-fastest-growing car market in the world, after China, over the next 10 years. “It’s time to redouble our efforts on our manufacturing and market presence here,” Mr. Wagoner told government ministers and auto industry executives in a conference on the Indian auto industry. Mr. Wagoner said G.M. planned to take advantage of India’s high-quality, low-cost supply base “to source more parts out of India.” In a statement issued after his presentation, Mr. Wagoner said the sourcing increase could be “as much as fivefold over the next two years.” Analysts said that might translate into G.M.’s buying as much as $1 billion worth of car parts in India annually, which would be the most spent by a foreign automaker in India. In a brief interview after the conference, Mr. Wagoner said that the increased sourcing of car parts from India would not affect United States jobs because the components in question are not made in America. He would not specify which parts would come from India in the future. Given the growth of G.M.’s manufacturing in Asia, a company base in India would provide new opportunities for Indian suppliers, he said, Indian manufacturing costs are already “extremely competitive and among the lowest in the world,” Mr. Wagoner said during the conference.

Left, Ms. Day with her car, which was rebuilt using parts from the front of one Monte Carlo and the rear of another. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 6, 2007 GETTING halves of two cars was not what Paulette Day expected when she bought a red 2004 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that year from a dealership near Detroit for $22,000. The car was used, but it was a &#8220;G.M. certified&#8221; car, meaning it had supposedly passed a rigorous inspection by the dealer. As General Motors says in its marketing material, buying a certified car means &#8220;the reliability of new and the affordability of used.&#8221; Not in this case. Ms. Day said she became suspicious about the car after noticing the paint did not match. After a mechanic put the car on a lift and saw the welds, Ms. Day learned that it included pieces from the front of one Monte Carlo and the rear of another, both seriously damaged in crashes. &#8220;I thought being certified, there are supposed to be so many checkpoints to make sure the car is safe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think they skipped over all of it. They would have had to notice that.&#8221; Certified used cars have become popular over the last five years, favored by consumers worried about getting a lemon when they buy used. A guarantee from an automaker that the car checks out is peace of mind for which an increasing number of people are willing to pay extra, sometimes $2,000 or more. But some consumers are finding that certified does not protect them and some, like Ms. Day, are filing lawsuits. Robert Minton, a G.M. spokesman, said the automaker would not comment on Ms. Day&#8217;s case. Three telephone calls to the dealership, Rowan Pontiac GMC in Southgate, Mich., were not returned. Automakers said buying a certified vehicle was the next best thing to buying new and that, in general, customers have been pleased with the programs. Indeed, most consumers who buy vehicles certified by automakers say they are substantially more satisfied with their vehicles than those who bought comparable used vehicles, said Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, a firm in Bandon, Ore., that studies buying habits. Certified vehicles &#8220;pretty much matched the satisfaction numbers you see from new cars,&#8221; he said. Last year, new-car dealers sold about six million used vehicles that were one to four years old. About 1.7 million of those vehicles were certified, he said. Automakers said that more than 100 items were inspected before a vehicle could be certified. Many involve major mechanical components and the frame. However, some of the inspection items are insignificant, like checking windshield-washer fluid, said Jack Gillis, director of public affairs for the Consumer Federation of America. If problems were found, the automakers said they had to be fixed for the vehicle to be listed as certified. Certification programs, which vary from automaker to automaker, usually cover current models and the previous four or five model years. Vehicles must have relatively low mileage, often less than 60,000 miles. The automakers&#8217; provide inspection guidelines and the extended warranty that comes with the certification, for which they charge the dealer several hundred dollars. The dealers conduct the actual inspections and decide how much more to charge the buyer for a certified vehicle. On average, a certified used car costs about $2,200 more than one that is not certified, CNW found. One problem for consumers is that there are no industry standards to define what certified means. Anyone from a major new-car dealer to the owner of a small used-car lot can say a vehicle is certified. Also, most automakers allow vehicles that have been in crashes to be certified if the damage was properly repaired and did not involve damage to the frame. &#8220;So long as the damage has been repaired, most vehicles can be certified,&#8221; said Virginia Y. Calder&#243;n, a San Diego lawyer who often handles complaints about certified cars. &#8220;You always have to be concerned about that.&#8221; In some lawsuits automakers have denied responsibility by saying the dealer &#151; not the automaker &#151; certified the vehicle.

Also, most automakers allow vehicles that have been in crashes to be certified if the damage was properly repaired and did not involve damage to the frame. &#8220;So long as the damage has been repaired, most vehicles can be certified,&#8221; said Virginia Y. Calder&#243;n, a San Diego lawyer who often handles complaints about certified cars. &#8220;You always have to be concerned about that.&#8221; In some lawsuits automakers have denied responsibility by saying the dealer &#151; not the automaker &#151; certified the vehicle.

His free agency will send ripples throughout the sport, potentially affecting driver salaries, merchandise sales and even television ratings, not to mention the balance of power among race teams. Skip to next paragraph Amy Conn/ Associated Press Dale Earnhardt, left, and his son Dale Jr., at Daytona International Speedway in 2001. Earnhardt Sr. died in a crash at Daytona that year. Earnhardt opened the door to all of that when he announced Thursday that he would leave Dale Earnhardt Inc. when his contract ends after this season. It was a stunning decision by Earnhardt, who has raced for his father’s team since his career began, winning 17 Cup races and two lower-level Busch Series championships. “At 32 years of age, the same as my father was when he made his final and most important career decision, it is time for me to compete on a consistent basis and contend for championships now,” Earnhardt said Thursday at a news conference at his JR Motorsports race shop. The announcement came after a year of negotiations that occasionally devolved into a public spat between Earnhardt and his stepmother, Teresa Earnhardt. She had taken over full ownership of the company after Dale Earnhardt died in a crash during the 2001 Daytona 500. It was Teresa Earnhardt’s stewardship, and Earnhardt’s belief that he could not win championships with D.E.I., that led to his departure. He has not won a race since May 6, 2006, and has only two victories since the start of 2005. “He needs to start winning again,” Humpy Wheeler, president of Lowe’s Motor Speedway and a longtime race promoter, said in a telephone interview. “He’s got to put himself in a position where he can win two or three races a year to keep that popularity, and he knows that. “Personalities drive all sports, and he is the most popular personality that we have. He accounts for a significant part of souvenir sales.” Maintaining that popularity will have an effect on everyone in the sport. “If Dale Jr. will wind up with a team that’s in contention to win races every week and contend for a championship, that’s got to help ticket sales at the gate, TV ratings, all those kinds of things,” Eddie Gossage, president of Texas Motor Speedway, said in a telephone interview. “It’s one of those things, a rising tide floats all boats.” Earnhardt is not the first Nascar driver to become a free agent. There are no rules limiting movement; it is relatively common for drivers to switch teams as contracts expire. But it is rare for a driver of Earnhardt’s stature, at the height of his career and popularity, to make himself available to other teams. to become a free agent. “A new paradigm has just been established in American motor sports,” Gossage wrote in an e-mail message. “Just as Andy Messersmith ushered in the era of modern-day free agency in major league baseball, Dale Jr. is establishing modern-day free agency in Nascar. Dale Jr. will now determine his full value on the open market and have the opportunity to make his own choices to put himself in a position to win races and championships. “Dale Jr.’s announcement is every bit as significant as A-Rod’s huge contract a few years back or ’s extraordinary contract signing last week with the Earnhardt said Thursday that this decision was not about money. He is looking to join a team that will help him win consistently. Kelley Earnhardt Elledge, Earnhardt’s sister and chief negotiator, said a number of teams had contacted them in recent months to express interest. They hope to have a deal done in 60 days, she said later. Earnhardt said he would listen to all offers but would work to remain with a Chevrolet team. Three Chevrolet teams are at the top of the sport: Hendrick Motorsports, Joe Gibbs Racing and Richard Childress Racing. Hendrick, though, has contracts with , Jimmie Johnson, Kyle Busch and Casey Mears and has sponsors through at least 2008. Nascar rules limit each owner to four drivers. Gibbs and Childress have three drivers apiece, but if Budweiser remains an Earnhardt sponsor that could be a problem. Gibbs does not want to be involved with an alcohol sponsorship and Childress has one with Jack Daniels, creating a conflict. “I think most everyone out there would say, ‘Yeah, he’d be a great fit here,’ ” J. D. Gibbs, president of Joe Gibbs Racing, said in a telephone interview. “I think for us, we’re just focusing kind of on what we’re doing now. Obviously he’s a big part of our sport, I think he could do about whatever he wants to do.” Earnhardt’s father won six of his seven championships for Childress. But Earnhardt would hesitate to drive the racecar that his father made famous. “I’ve got to do a little soul searching about how I feel about driving the No. 3 car,” he said. Earnhardt did not rule out driving a different racecar for Childress, though. He also could create a Cup team for JR Motorsports, although that is not the No. 1 option. Wherever he goes, the greatest impact could ultimately be felt at Dale Earnhardt Inc., which is losing the sport’s most marketable driver. “Well, the most classic statement that I’ve heard, and it came from : ‘What’s D.E.I. without Dale Jr.? A museum,’ ” said the three-time Cup champion Darrell Waltrip, who attended the news conference. “And that’s a pretty good analogy, I would say.” More Articles in Sports &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Say I.P., for instrument panel, as designers do. Skip to next paragraph Dropping in a mention of the greenhouse or the beltline is pretty easy, but you will really get points with casual references to A-, B-, and C-pillars, the order of the roof supports arranged from the windshield, whose base is called the cowl, to the rear window, or backlight. You might say, “That fat C-pillar would make it impossible to parallel park.” Every profession has its lingo. A list of common terms — and a few of the most colorful ones — can come in handy. With cars, words and metal share territory: each brand’s vocabulary of shapes is collectively known as its design language. The beltline divides the greenhouse, or glassed-in upper body, from the portion that extends down from the window sills. Equally important is the A-line, said Michael Castiglione, principal exterior designer at DaimlerChrysler’s Pacifica studio in Carlsbad, Calif. The A-line runs the length of the body from headlight to taillight, tracing the car’s silhouette. The car may also have a character line, a crease formed in the sheet metal of the sides. Vehicles are said to have styling cues that prompt viewers to recognize models by their resemblance to other family members — a brand’s characteristic shapes and flourishes, the form of its grille or the arc of the roofline. Cumulatively, they make up the D.R.G., or down-the-road graphic of a car, the visual signature of a quickly glimpsed vehicle that should make it recognizable as a Cadillac or a Ford. At the extreme, think . D.R.G. is not to be confused with D.L.O., for daylight opening, the total area of the window glass. The angle of the windshield is known as its rake — an extreme tilt is said to be fast — while the inward angle of the side greenhouse windows is called the tumblehome. The body section below the base of the door, or rocker panel, is treated with a varying degree of turn-under, which Chris Chapman of BMW’s Designworks studio in Newbury Park, Calif., defines as the shape of the panel as it curves inward at the lower edge. The front face of a car is visually grounded in the lower fascia or valance, typically made of plastic these days. Stance is critical to the character a car projects, and its aggressiveness is frequently noted by designers in their presentations at new-model unveilings. The term refers to the way the body sits on the wheels, with energy — or not. Robert Boniface, director of advanced design for General Motors, recently worked on the Chevrolet Volt and Camaro show cars. He said that “stance has to do with the relative visual stability or instability of a particular design.” Cars with good stance are often referred to as being planted; small wheels and a wide upper body give a car a poor stance. Being planted lends a sense of sure-footedness to the design. Too high a stance can suggest standing on tiptoe, a tentative look. One critical element, designers said, is the axle-to-dash ratio, the proportion between the front wheel and the cowl (which is the base of the windshield). It helps to define the visual personality of the car. Another important relationship, according to Bryan Thompson, a car designer at the Nissan Design America studio in La Jolla, Calif., is that between glass and body. “A vehicle whose body is relatively thick compared to the amount of glass is called chunky,” he said. The proportion between wheel and body sizes is important in lending a vehicle its visual personality. “Wheel-to-body is the relationship of the wheel-tire plane to the sheet metal wheel opening,” Mr. Thompson said. “Wheels that are flush to the body are desirable. Wheels that are well inboard of the sheet metal plane are buried. Vehicles with buried wheels are called overbodied.” At its extreme, an overbodied car has the look of a parade float, with the body visually overpowering the wheels, Mr. Thompson said. The distinctive “bathtub” Nashes of the early 1950s suffered this trait. There is also what is called the roller skate effect, where the wheels and tires are too small for the body. (Volkswagens of the 1980s seemed to have especially small wheels proportionally, and fell prey to this phenomenon.) Huge wheels of 20, 22 or 23 inches, by contrast, make a vehicle look tough.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 29, 2007 Skip to next paragraph The Future of Hydrogen Comparing Six Hydrogen Vehicles WHEN the largest aircraft ever built — the pride of Nazi Germany — crashed in flames at the United States Navy’s airship base here, it took 36 lives and smeared the reputation of hydrogen for decades. In less than a minute, the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 turned hydrogen, which provided the zeppelin’s lift, into a pariah. But 70 years later, a growing number of advocates are promoting hydrogen as a panacea, a promising alternative to petroleum. In the last decade, every large carmaker has jumped on the hydrogen express. In dozens of laboratories and research centers, scientists and engineers are busy searching for ways to reduce the cost and improve the practicality of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Development has progressed to the point that some of these prototype vehicles are in daily service, commuting around Detroit, delivering packages in Washington, serving urban bus routes. To look in on the development progress of hydrogen vehicles, The New York Times invited 10 companies actively promoting hydrogen for personal transportation to bring their vehicles to the Naval Air Engineering Station here. With pressure mounting to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, the anniversary of a pivotal event 70 years ago seemed an appropriate time to look for a clearer understanding of what cars may be like in 30 years. Some carmakers deemed the disaster site an awkward location for this gathering; others were sympathetic but unable to field a vehicle because experimental mules have testing and appearance schedules busier than those of presidential hopefuls. The three hydrogen-powered vehicles that did arrive here (all by trailer, because refueling was not available for the long trips from their bases) were not the latest models from the auto show circuit, but hard-working development vehicles with thousands of testing miles on their odometers. Weather was also a factor. The day of the gathering was fraught by a severe northeaster. Six inches of rain was followed by flooded roads and snow, as the winds blew and angry skies frowned. But the show went on, thanks in part to the hosts at the base and the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society. The Hindenburg anniversary is not the only reason hydrogen is in the news. Four years ago, in his State of the Union address, President Bush announced a $1.2 billion hydrogen initiative to foster clean air and lessen dependence on imported oil. The Department of Energy has conducted marriages of sorts, joining automakers with energy companies — General Motors and Shell; Ford and DaimlerChrysler with BP — to encourage research and set standards for refueling hardware. As hydrogen gains favor, hydrocarbons seem to be taking over the role of villain. Peak oil theorists, especially Matthew Simmons, chairman of the Simmons & Company investment bank and the author of “Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy” contend that increased demand will outpace the ability to increase production. And the Supreme Court’s April 2 ruling that the E.P.A. has authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, as it does tailpipe emissions, was a powerful vote against fossil fuels. So the three hydrogen-fueled vehicles that gathered at the Hindenburg crash site are harbingers of the future, proof that all of hydrogen’s potential in transportation did not go up in flames 70 years ago. The spot where the Hindenburg met its end is now a historic landmark. A heavy yellow anchor chain surrounds a concrete pad replicating the size, shape, and final resting place of the Hindenburg’s control car. Rick Zitarosa, historian of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, said the Navy intended to preserve the site in its current form. The vehicles here, and three other experimental cars driven elsewhere, cover a broad spectrum of hydrogen possibilities. Here are highlights: Ford regards hydrogen-fueled internal-combustion engines as “a bridge to fuel cells, the powertrain of the future.” Teamed with BP, Ford built a fleet of 30 E-450 shuttle buses.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 29, 2007 Skip to next paragraph The Future of Hydrogen Comparing Six Hydrogen Vehicles WHEN the largest aircraft ever built — the pride of Nazi Germany — crashed in flames at the United States Navy’s airship base here, it took 36 lives and smeared the reputation of hydrogen for decades. In less than a minute, the Hindenburg disaster of 1937 turned hydrogen, which provided the zeppelin’s lift, into a pariah. But 70 years later, a growing number of advocates are promoting hydrogen as a panacea, a promising alternative to petroleum. In the last decade, every large carmaker has jumped on the hydrogen express. In dozens of laboratories and research centers, scientists and engineers are busy searching for ways to reduce the cost and improve the practicality of hydrogen-powered vehicles. Development has progressed to the point that some of these prototype vehicles are in daily service, commuting around Detroit, delivering packages in Washington, serving urban bus routes. To look in on the development progress of hydrogen vehicles, The New York Times invited 10 companies actively promoting hydrogen for personal transportation to bring their vehicles to the Naval Air Engineering Station here. With pressure mounting to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere, the anniversary of a pivotal event 70 years ago seemed an appropriate time to look for a clearer understanding of what cars may be like in 30 years. Some carmakers deemed the disaster site an awkward location for this gathering; others were sympathetic but unable to field a vehicle because experimental mules have testing and appearance schedules busier than those of presidential hopefuls. The three hydrogen-powered vehicles that did arrive here (all by trailer, because refueling was not available for the long trips from their bases) were not the latest models from the auto show circuit, but hard-working development vehicles with thousands of testing miles on their odometers. Weather was also a factor. The day of the gathering was fraught by a severe northeaster. Six inches of rain was followed by flooded roads and snow, as the winds blew and angry skies frowned. But the show went on, thanks in part to the hosts at the base and the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society. The Hindenburg anniversary is not the only reason hydrogen is in the news. Four years ago, in his State of the Union address, President Bush announced a $1.2 billion hydrogen initiative to foster clean air and lessen dependence on imported oil. The Department of Energy has conducted marriages of sorts, joining automakers with energy companies — General Motors and Shell; Ford and DaimlerChrysler with BP — to encourage research and set standards for refueling hardware. As hydrogen gains favor, hydrocarbons seem to be taking over the role of villain. Peak oil theorists, especially Matthew Simmons, chairman of the Simmons & Company investment bank and the author of “Twilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy” contend that increased demand will outpace the ability to increase production. And the Supreme Court’s April 2 ruling that the E.P.A. has authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, as it does tailpipe emissions, was a powerful vote against fossil fuels. So the three hydrogen-fueled vehicles that gathered at the Hindenburg crash site are harbingers of the future, proof that all of hydrogen’s potential in transportation did not go up in flames 70 years ago. The spot where the Hindenburg met its end is now a historic landmark. A heavy yellow anchor chain surrounds a concrete pad replicating the size, shape, and final resting place of the Hindenburg’s control car. Rick Zitarosa, historian of the Navy Lakehurst Historical Society, said the Navy intended to preserve the site in its current form. The vehicles here, and three other experimental cars driven elsewhere, cover a broad spectrum of hydrogen possibilities. Here are highlights: Ford regards hydrogen-fueled internal-combustion engines as “a bridge to fuel cells, the powertrain of the future.” Teamed with BP, Ford built a fleet of 30 E-450 shuttle buses.

Streamlining was a modernist trend, with toasters, typewriters, vacuum cleaners and even buildings designed to evoke a future of speed. “That was how we came up with the idea of looking at the streamline design of the ’30s,” Jim Ballinger, the museum’s director, said in a recent interview. “It was so pervasive in the art world. The actual science of aerodynamics was having an impact, but ultimately, it’s the stylization of that.” Working with art and automotive experts, the Arizona museum has assembled a collection of 22 automobiles, many of them landmark designs from the 1930s. Later cars in the collection show how aerodynamics developed and was used to real effect in land-speed record attempts, in racecars and in one of the most exotic supercars, the McLaren F1. The queen of the exhibition is the voluptuous 1939 Delahaye Type 165 designed by Giuseppi Figoni in what could be the pinnacle of coach-built artistry. The enormous cabriolet seems to float above the surface, surreal sexuality glistening in its gleaming red paint. The star of France’s display at the 1939 World’s Fair, its presence is no less jaw-dropping today. In the Depression-wracked 1930s, the reality was that most vehicles were boxy contraptions. But curvaceous streamlined cars like these embodied dreams of affluence. The Phoenix Art Museum is no stranger to rare historic automobiles; the Copperstate 1000 vintage-car road rally has raised money for the museum for 17 years. For Curves of Steel, the museum borrowed the cars from private collections and auto museums around the country. One featured car, a 1934 Chrysler Imperial Airflow, was driven to the museum by its owner. The cars are displayed in a stark gallery, each on a raised platform to enhance the sense of a sculpture exhibition. The only extraneous items are captions that appear below each car, explaining how it came to be and its role in auto design. Four automobiles are outside the gallery, the robust teardrop form of the 1935 Stout Scarab greeting visitors as they enter the museum. A rakish 1957 Ferrari 625/250 Testa Rossa crouches near the entrance. French automotive art of the 1930s is lavishly represented. The 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic, with its riveted aluminum structure, was a groundbreaking design by Jean Bugatti, son of the company’s legendary founder, Ettore. Nearby stands the lush form of the 1938 Talbot-Lago T150C, a rendition of perfection from the coachbuilders Figoni & Falaschi. There is also the sophisticated urban shape of the 1936 Peugeot 402 Darl’mat and the dramatically aeronautical 1937 Dubonnet Hispano-Suiza H-6c Xenia. The American cars show how streamlining made its way into production vehicles, with classics like the 1935 Auburn 851 Boattail Speedster, the 1937 Cord 812 Sportsman and the 1939 Lincoln Zephyr, advertised as looking as though it were going 60 miles an hour even when standing still. A more down-to-earth vehicle is the ’34 Chrysler Imperial, a bold attempt to bring steamlining to the showroom. But despite a shape that looks so interesting today, the Airflow was a commercial failure; many ended up as taxicabs. In contrast, the 1948 Tatra T87, a radically finned sedan from Czechoslovakia, had a long, successful run after its debut in 1934. “We wanted to do a show on automotive design the same way we do a great art exhibit, so that the exhibit is also a contribution to the field,” Mr. Ballinger said. Phil Patton, a freelance design writer who frequently contributes to The New York Times, was a curatorial consultant for the exhibition.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 UMM AL QAYWAYN, United Arab Emirates Skip to next paragraph Daryl Visscher for The New York Times The police have cracked down on drag racing on Jumeirah Beach Road in Dubai. LAST month at the Emirates Motorplex, Ahmed Rashid al-Hajji sat in the stands with a small group of friends, quietly sizing up the competition. In March he had been out on the track himself and had planned to be racing in April. “My car was ready until Wednesday night,” he said. “I was tuning my car in my friend’s garage, but there my luck was bad. So, inshallah,” or God willing, “next time.” Not that long ago, Mr. Hajji would have been on Jumeirah Beach Road, a long stretch of highway that runs through Dubai, pitting his souped-up Nissan Skyline GT-R 33 against Lamborghinis and Mercedes-Benz SL55s. But drivers said that a crackdown on aggressive driving by the Dubai police discouraged street racing, so Mr. Hajji’s Skyline sat at home for five months. “Then one of my friends told me, ‘Why don’t you go to the track?’ ” he said, referring to the Emirates Motorplex. He took the suggestion and earned fourth place in his debut run. There are many stories like his at the motorplex, a complex for quarter-mile drag racing deep in the desert of the Umm al Qaywayn emirate (one of the seven that make up the United Arab Emirates), about an hour’s drive northeast of Dubai. Although still relatively off the mainstream radar, the complex has become a safe way for Emirates gearheads to get off local roads to test their mettle on a track instead. The track was created by Sheik Marwan al-Mualla, son of the ruler of Umm al Qaywayn and chairman of the Emirates Motor Sports Federation. He financed the building of the track with his own money, initially as a way for his friends and him to compete against one another. He sees the track as a way to reduce accidents by providing drivers with a safe environment. “We have safety here, paramedics, an ambulance, and we give out trophies to the winners, something they can’t get on the street,” said Sheik Mualla, who no longer races on the track. “So what’s the reason to race out on the main roads?” Depending on whom you ask, Dubai is either a driver’s dream or a nightmare. Dubai is among the few cities of its size — it has a population of about 1.35 million — to have been built almost entirely after the invention of the automobile, which is apparent in the city’s general layout: a kind of Le Corbusien fantasy of skyscrapers, superhighways, sprawling shopping complexes and cities within cities, with little public transportation. Here, driving is a necessity. Cars are more than a means of transportation, however: With a real growth rate in gross domestic product of 10.2 percent in 2006, local Emiratis are making a lot of money, and automobiles are a highly visible expression of wealth, power and ambition. Not surprisingly, this has helped make Dubai a playground for high-octane thrill-seekers once the sun goes down and the traffic thins out. This aggressiveness makes Dubai a dangerous place to drive. Despite some successful efforts, including the recent installation of speed bumps along Jumeirah Beach Road, the Dubai Road and Transport Authority reported that road fatalities had increased by 32 percent from 2005 to 2006, with 312 people killed in Dubai last year. Judging by the stories of the drag racers at the Emirates Motorplex, the idea of competing in front of cheering crowds on Thursdays and Fridays once a month is capturing the imagination of former street racers. Similar factors in Southern California led to a proliferation of drag-racing parks in the 1950s in attempts to rein in street racing. In the U.A.E., this hasn’t meant the end of street racing any more than it did in California, but according to Abdulla Essa, manager of the traffic department of Umm al Qaywayn, there has been a decrease in accidents among young drivers in the emirate over the last four years. The motorplex, which also has tracks for motocross and all-terrain vehicles, has an overwhelmingly local feel. These aren’t your average Pabst Blue Ribbon-drinking spectators — and it’s not simply because there’s no drinking allowed on the premises.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 FERRARI cleans out its garage, so to speak, with an auction at its track near Maranello, Italy, on May 20. You can call it a factory sale or you can call it more grandly the Leggenda e Passione auction, as RM Auctions does. A sale at the factory suggests surplus stacked on the loading dock or samples outside a Seventh Avenue loft. But when the factory is Ferrari’s, you don’t just drive up in your van. Ferrari allowed RM Auctions to handle the sale as part of the automaker’s 60th-anniversary celebration and to call attention to its new services of certifying and restoring vintage Ferraris. The auction is the first sale in Europe for RM Auctions, the Canadian company that is collaborating on this sale with Sotheby’s. The star of the event is a 1962 Ferrari 330 TRI/LM Testa Rossa, the only 4-liter and the last racing Testa Rossa by Ferrari. It was driven by the endurance racers Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien. The other stars of the sale are cars well known to Ferrari buffs, well traveled to shows and concours and often auctioned. Built in runs of 10 or a dozen, these are cars that buffs know by their chassis numbers.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 FERRARI cleans out its garage, so to speak, with an auction at its track near Maranello, Italy, on May 20. You can call it a factory sale or you can call it more grandly the Leggenda e Passione auction, as RM Auctions does. A sale at the factory suggests surplus stacked on the loading dock or samples outside a Seventh Avenue loft. But when the factory is Ferrari’s, you don’t just drive up in your van. Ferrari allowed RM Auctions to handle the sale as part of the automaker’s 60th-anniversary celebration and to call attention to its new services of certifying and restoring vintage Ferraris. The auction is the first sale in Europe for RM Auctions, the Canadian company that is collaborating on this sale with Sotheby’s. The star of the event is a 1962 Ferrari 330 TRI/LM Testa Rossa, the only 4-liter and the last racing Testa Rossa by Ferrari. It was driven by the endurance racers Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien. The other stars of the sale are cars well known to Ferrari buffs, well traveled to shows and concours and often auctioned. Built in runs of 10 or a dozen, these are cars that buffs know by their chassis numbers. Some are simply legendary pieces of engineering and design, like the most powerful Ferrari of its era, the 1953 Ferrari 340MM, with a 4.1-liter, 300-horsepower V-12. Some are famous for their drivers, like the 1970 Ferrari 512 S raced by Luigi Chinetti’s North American Racing Team twice at Sebring or the 1966 Ferrari Dino 206 SP.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 15, 2007 A TWO-SEAT touring motorcycle without a passenger backrest or top luggage case, it occurs to me, is a vehicle with the everyday practicality of a backless hospital gown. There just seems to be something missing, you know? But if you can find someone daring (or clueless) enough to ride with you on the back of a 2007 BMW K1200GT, a 152-horsepower sport bike adapted to long-distance duty, you’re not likely to even know they are there anyway. Indeed, whack open the throttle with a passenger aboard, as I did recently while entering a freeway, and you might wonder if your companion could possibly hang on for the sprint through the gears. The passenger’s inevitable rearward slide can be avoided, though, by ordering an optional top case (available in large or small). But that is not the way BMW really intended the K1200GT to be equipped. Despite having room for a passenger, the K1200GT is styled and designed to be the ultimate loner’s touring bike. Who besides the operator really wants to tour at triple digits? The superbike-class horsepower of the K1200GT is a relatively new phenomenon at BMW, a departure from the company’s legacy of workhorse opposed-twin engines, which power its R series bikes. The K designation signifies an in-line 4-cylinder engine, which in this case positions the cylinders transversely across the frame, like most Japanese in-line 4s. The engine of the original K bikes, introduced in the mid-1980s, was aligned front to back, with the cylinders canted over horizontally, parallel to the ground. The K1200LT, a comfort-oriented touring model, still uses this layout. BMW’s shift in design philosophy is a result of its intent to establish a presence in the high-performance class long dominated by Japanese makers, whose bikes seem to ratchet up the horsepower each model year. How do the K bikes measure up? Well, the K1200R was named the 2005 Motorcycle of the Year by Motorcyclist, an enthusiast publication; a K1200S went 173 miles an hour to set a class speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in 2005; and the editors of Cycle World magazine selected the K1200GT as the industry’s top sport-touring bike for 2006. The temptation is to say the K1200GT is all about its engine. Top speed is somewhere north of 150 miles an hour — a speed at which you can run confidently and comfortably (though illegally, in most places) given the right roads. All this motive power is courtesy of a slightly reworked version of the 1,157 cc four also used in the K1200S and K1200R models, both of which put more than 160 horsepower at the rider’s disposal. Though in the K1200GT this powerplant makes just 152 horsepower, it is still enough to be the benchmark of the sport-touring class. As a whole, it seems the K lineup is becoming more like a motorcycling equivalent of BMW’s racing-inspired M cars. Beyond the high-performance aspects, though, there is also a high-tech factor that enhances the appeal of these bikes. The K1200GT was introduced in 2006, then quickly updated. The 2007 model was released with compelling new features like electronic traction control — automatic stability control in BMW’s lexicon — that was an industry first (although it is spreading to other BMW models). The nomenclature is potentially confusing. On automobiles, stability control usually describes a system that can apply the brake at one of the car’s four corners to interrupt a skid and put the vehicle back on the path the driver intended to take. The system on a two-wheel K1200GT obviously cannot do that, but it can help when the rear loses traction. The bike system, a $365 option, reduces engine power through the ignition or fuel injection, enabling the rear wheel to regain traction. The traction control works in conjunction with BMW’s integral antilock brakes, using the same sensors. The sensors determine when the front and rear wheels are moving at different speeds. The system works best compensating for road hazards like wet pavement, slippery white lines and manhole covers, or gravel on the road.

Begging to be noticed. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 ACURA says the exterior styling of its redesigned MDX sport wagon was inspired by high-end yachts, like the Wally Boat. Skip to next paragraph The X Files: Four Luxury Crossovers Really? From a side view, I see the profile of one of those surplus World War II DUKW amphibious craft. Duck Tour, anyone? In considering what the second-generation MDX should look like, Acura’s designers decided to depart from the safe me-too look of most S.U.V.’s. They wanted to make a notice-me statement, and they have certainly succeeded, from the anime-inspired grille to the nautical prow to the hunched haunches. The MDX made its debut as a 2001 model, greatly improving on the poorly received Isuzu-built SLX sport utility that Acura had previously tried to sell. The MDX hit the streets with stellar build quality, quickly built a reliability record to match and gained immediate respect. What it didn’t get was a lot of buyers. Competitors, including luxury sport wagons from German manufacturers, had a decided advantage in overall performance. The MDX was also saddled with comparatively bland styling. Worse, its own stablemate, the similar but less expensive Honda Pilot, poached sales from the same pool of buyers. Still, I considered the MDX a best buy, because it offered perhaps the auto industry’s best array of standard features at an excellent price in the mid-$30,000 range. Initially, the only option was a $2,000 DVD navigation system. For 2007, the base price has passed $40,000, and although the Acura still has an enviable array of standard features, a buyer seeking a loaded MDX must shell out another $8,000 for options. Acura is gambling that it can change minds and buying decisions in the high end of the S.U.V. market where BMW, Porsche and Mercedes play. In the past, MDX buyers were mostly women, who considered the outgoing MDX a comfortable, cushy, bullet-proof people hauler and grocery getter. This new model will probably seem like overkill to them. Now Acura is aiming at men. The MDX has been completely reimagined as a cutting-edge performance machine, with macho styling and a positively Teutonic array of electronic and telematic equipment. The MDX still comes only with a V-6, but the new 3.7-liter engine makes a more competitive 300 horsepower; indeed, this is Acura’s most powerful engine ever — even the discontinued NSX exotic sports car mustered only 253 horsepower. A dual-stage intake manifold and unusually high 11.0:1 compression ratio give the MDX’s engine the punch of a V-8 while sipping fuel like a V-6. In combined city and highway driving, I found it traveled nearly 20 miles on a gallon of premium unleaded. The MDX also still comes with a five-speed automatic that can be shifted like a manual. Although some competitors offer six- and even seven-speed transmissions, the MDX didn’t seem gear-deprived. This year, power is delivered as needed to each wheel through Acura’s savvy Super Handling All-Wheel-Drive system (introduced in the RL sedan), wherein the outside wheels can rotate faster to facilitate cornering. The racetrack-tuned suspension offers switchable sport and comfort settings. A magnetic shock-absorber system, included with the optional Sport Package, includes two-mode active dampers that increase stability and body control in hard maneuvers without ill effects on the ride. The MDX’s quickness and dexterity compare favorably with pricier high-performance rivals like the Porsche Cayenne and BMW X5. What’s more, towing capacity is 5,000 pounds, certainly adequate for a car-based utility. Standard safety equipment includes front air bags, side air bags mounted in the front seats, full-length side curtain bags, active front head restraints, stability control with a stabilizing feature for towing, tire-pressure monitors and antilock disc brakes with brake assist. The brakes, by the way, provided strong, sure stops. The MDX has grown to seven-passenger capacity, with three rows of seats; leather is standard on all MDXs. The power-adjustable front seats are handsome, firm and supportive. The roomy second row, which folds in a 60-40 configuration, has reclining seatbacks and a folding center section that doubles as an armrest with cup holders (in addition to other beverage and gear cubbies in the door pockets and elsewhere). The third row, split 50-50, is fit only for children. Next Article in Automobiles (1 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Now it turns out that selling Chrysler isn&#8217;t all that easy either. The effort by DaimlerChrysler to find a buyer for Chrysler is becoming a drawn-out, complicated process that barely advanced this week, bogged down by issues including debt, Chrysler&#8217;s health care liability and the role of the union, bankers involved in the negotiations said. Moreover, none of the bidders appear to be in a rush to snap up the struggling car company. On Friday, the Canadian automobile supplier Magna International confirmed the widely reported speculation that it was among those interested in Chrysler. But Magna, in a statement, said, &#8220;There is no assurance that any transaction will result from Magna&#8217;s current involvement.&#8221; Even if they represent firm offers, the proposals are likely to be laden with contingencies and requirements that DaimlerChrysler might find too onerous to accept, the bankers said. They insisted on anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks. That raises the possibility that some or all of the bidders eventually could drop out, these bankers and industry analysts said. &#8220;We are really at the very early stage of the process,&#8221; Stefano Aversa, co-president of AlixPartners, a restructuring firm based in Southfield, Mich., said Wednesday. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be an easy decision for DaimlerChrysler. This is not going to be by any means just a simple acquisition.&#8221; Investors, who sent DaimlerChrysler shares to a new high last week when the billionaire investor offered to pay $4.5 billion for Chrysler, apparently do not like the cold shoulder that he is getting from the company. DaimlerChrysler shares ended the week at $82.26, down 76 cents Friday. By contrast, the shares closed at $84.80 on April 5 when Mr. Kerkorian&#8217;s bid came to light. Mr. Kerkorian made his bid public after , which is handling the Chrysler sale, failed to send his advisers the packet of information that was given to other bidders. And while company officials held meetings with some of those bidders in New York this week, Mr. Kerkorian&#8217;s representatives apparently were not included. The animosity has deep roots. Mr. Kerkorian, who as Chrysler&#8217;s biggest shareholder constantly pushed it to place more emphasis on shareholder returns, sued DaimlerChrysler in 2000. He asserted that he had been misled into supporting the deal by the assertions of executives that it was a &#8220;merger of equals&#8221; instead of a takeover by Daimler-Benz. A federal judge ruled against Mr. Kerkorian in 2005. Thus far, Chrysler has drawn interest from two investment firms &#151; Cerberus Capital and the Blackstone Group &#151; as well as Magna, which is involved in a number of production ventures with DaimlerChrysler. But the discussions, which this week included R&#252;diger Grube, a DaimlerChrysler board member, have not yet begun to narrow down the particulars, the bankers who have been advising those bidders said. Although some reports have said DaimlerChrysler would like to focus on a leading candidate by the end of the month, these advisers said it could take weeks more for the potential bidders to get a true picture of how any transaction was likely to be structured. Further, there seems to be no hurry on the part of either DaimlerChrysler or the bidders to come up with a price for Chrysler, which is likely to be billions less than Daimler-Benz paid. The old price is &#8220;not material&#8221; to the current discussions, Mr. Aversa of AlixPartners said. Daimler-Benz paid $36 billion for Chrysler in 1998 in what was originally termed a &#8220;merger of equals&#8221; but turned out to be a takeover by the German automaker of the American company. In February, Mr. Zetsche, who played pitchman as Dr. Z in Chrysler commercials, said the company was keeping its options open for Chrysler. Chrysler lost $1.5 billion last year, and has required two restructurings in the last seven years. Valuing an independent Chrysler is particularly difficult because it does not have independently traded shares and because transferring ownership of a huge automaker at a time of such turmoil in the industry is complex. The only means for determining a fair value will come from a potential buyer&#8217;s plan to restructure Chrysler, Mr. Aversa said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure the business plan is not going to be just business as usual, given the losses,&#8221; he said. Indeed, bankers say the discussions have centered less on the overall value of Chrysler and more on issues surrounding the company, like the debt load that DaimlerChrysler carries on Chrysler&#8217;s behalf, a burden it might want to transfer to the new owners. The company also is far from resolving what it might do about the $18 billion liability it faces for current and future health care coverage for employees. Mr. Kerkorian, in his bid, suggested that the liability be shared between the Tracinda Corporation, his investment arm, and DaimlerChrysler, but other bidders may push for DaimlerChrysler to absorb the entire expense. Likewise, it is far from clear what role the U.A.W. would play under new ownership. The U.A.W.&#8217;s president, Ron Gettelfinger, who sits on the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board and has a vote in the outcome, has said he would prefer that Chrysler remain under DaimlerChrysler&#8217;s wing, rather than be sold to private investors. The president of the union, Basil Hargrove, has said he opposes a sale to Mr. Kerkorian. The situation is easily as complicated as the sale by last year to Cerberus of a 51 percent stake in its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, said one person involved in the Chrysler discussions. In that case, the estimated price of the G.M.A.C. stake fell several times as G.M. looked for buyers. Early on, analysts estimated G.M. might get as much as $16 billion for half of G.M.A.C. But those estimates dropped to about $11 billion, after G.M.&#8217;s auto sales declined and the company encountered problems at Residential Capital, its residential mortgage unit. The final agreement, announced a year ago, was for $7.4 billion from a consortium headed by Cerberus, along with $2.7 billion in G.M.A.C. assets that G.M. credited to Cerberus. G.M. said last month that it would pay settlement charges of $1 billion to reflect changes in G.M.A.C.&#8217;s balance sheet, and analysts say more revisions may be in store for the G.M.A.C. deal.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/08/us/politics/08obama.html	Obama Criticizes Automakers on Fuel Economy - New York Times Obama Criticizes Automakers on Fuel Economy Senator Barack Obama said Monday in Detroit that he wanted to address automakers on their turf with his criticism and his proposals. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 8, 2007 DETROIT, May 7 — Senator of Illinois delivered a stern message to Detroit auto companies on Monday, saying they had done little to lessen the nation’s dependence on foreign oil and needed to improve the fuel efficiency of their vehicles. Skip to next paragraph The latest political news from around the nation. Sounding at times like a teacher scolding a lazy but promising student, Mr. Obama at the same time proposed incentives to help General Motors, Ford and Chrysler out of a lingering slump that has resulted in dozens of plant closings and the elimination of tens of thousands of jobs this decade. Appearing before a luncheon held by the Detroit Economic Club, Mr. Obama, a Democratic presidential candidate, received a standing ovation when he was introduced by Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick, and again at the close of his remarks, which were broadcast live by local television stations. Mr. Obama, making his first campaign visit to Michigan, said he wanted to be blunt with Detroit auto companies on their home turf. Chief executives of the auto companies were not in attendance. “I’m making this proposal here today because I don’t believe in making proposals in California and giving a different speech in Michigan,” he said. His goal “is not to destroy the industry, but to help bring it into the 21st century,” he said. Under Mr. Obama’s plan, which he said would save 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, he proposed a 4 percent a year increase in fuel economy standards beginning in 2009, or the equivalent of about one mile per gallon per year. By 2022, the fuel economy standard for both cars and light trucks would be 40 miles per gallon, according to the plan. The Bush administration has proposed a similar method to raise the fuel economy standard over the next few years. The current federal standards are 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 24 miles per gallon for light trucks. While the American standard for cars has not increased in the last 20 years, both China and Japan have higher standards, Mr. Obama said. He maintained that cars in Japan typically achieved the equivalent of 45 miles per gallon. In fact, the average fuel economy in 2006 for cars sold by all manufacturers in the United States was slightly more than 30 miles per gallon, higher than the federal standard requires. But automakers’ overall fuel economy was 24.2 miles per gallon, because light trucks, including S.U.V.’s, pickups and minivans, account for slightly more than half the vehicles sold in the United States. The discussion over the standards accelerated last month, when the Supreme Court ruled that the had the ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. The primary way to do so, experts say, is by raising fuel efficiency. Mr. Obama also proposed that fuel efficiency standards for cars be rewritten so that mileage requirements are set according to vehicle size, rather than one sweeping standard for all sizes of cars. The current method benefits Japanese auto companies, whose lineups are not as varied as their Detroit rivals, said Mr. Obama, whose state is home to a Ford assembly plant, as well as one owned by the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration took a similar step this decade in recalculating the fuel economy standard for light trucks. Detroit auto companies have backed that as an option for recalculating fuel economy standards for cars. As a carrot to the industry, Mr. Obama would provide up to $3 billion to Detroit auto companies and their suppliers to retool factories to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. If the companies invest in these vehicles, Mr. Obama also would offer the Detroit companies assistance in dealing with their burden of paying for current and retired workers’ health care expenses, estimated at $1,500 per vehicle. But a spokesman for G.M., Greg Martin, said the automaker preferred to see a broader approach to soaring health care costs. “Health care is an issue that should be a national priority and not an issue unique to G.M.,” Mr. Martin said. Despite Mr. Obama’s sometimes harsh words Monday, the diverse audience interrupted him 10 times for applause. “I think it took a lot of courage to come to Detroit and lay it on the line,” said Peter Eckstein, a retired labor union economist from Ann Arbor, Mich. Leonard Mungo, a Detroit lawyer, said he was surprised to hear specific proposals for addressing the industry’s problems. “He’s saying, ‘You got yourselves into this mess, but now this is how we get out,’ ” Mr. Mungo said.

Mitch Daniels of Indiana at the Subaru plant Friday. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 21, 2007 LAFAYETTE, Ind., April 20 — The Toyota Motor Company will sell more imported vehicles in the United States this year, Toyota officials acknowledged Friday, even though the company has begun building Camry sedans at a Subaru plant here to replace those built in Japan. Toyota’s imports will rise because it expects a significant increase in sales for the hybrid-electric Prius, which it builds only in Japan, said James Lentz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. He estimated that Toyota’s total imports would probably rise by about 25,000 this year, if Toyota meets its sales targets for the Prius. To be sure, Toyota’s production in North America is also rising as it opens new factories of its own and adds production at the Subaru plant here, where it expects to build 100,000 Camrys a year. This week, it broke ground for a plant in Mississippi, its eighth assembly plant in North America. It is building a new factory in Canada and opened a plant in Texas last fall. Even so, Toyota’s imports as a percentage of its American sales have risen in the last three years, figures criticized by some supporters of Detroit’s carmakers. In 2006, 46 percent of Toyota’s vehicles were imported from Japan compared with 38.4 percent in 2005 and 37 percent in 2004. Toyota sold 2.54 million vehicles in the United States last year, a record for the automaker, which passed DaimlerChrysler to rank third behind General Motors and the Ford Motor Company. It has forecast that its American sales will rise to 2.68 million this year. About 40,000 of those vehicles will be Camrys built at the Subaru plant, owned by Fuji Heavy Industries. Toyota bought a stake in Fuji in 2005 from General Motors and immediately began looking for arrangements involving Fuji plants and the company’s engineers. It announced the deal to build Camrys here just over a year ago, investing $230 million in the project, which will add 1,000 jobs at the plant. Fuji opened the factory in 1988 to build Subaru and Isuzu vehicles. James Doyle, president of the Level Field Institute, an organization founded by retirees of the Detroit automakers, said that he was pleased to see Toyota’s investment but that it did not compare with those by Detroit companies. Toyota accounts for 9 percent of automotive manufacturing jobs in the United States and roughly 16 percent of the vehicle market, while G.M. accounts for 29 percent of the jobs and about 24 percent of the market, Mr. Doyle said. “We lose 10 for every one job that they bring,” Mr. Doyle said. And despite the start of Camry production here, Toyota will still import 60,000 Camrys from Japan this year, Mr. Lentz said. Along with that, Toyota also expects to import about 70,000 more Priuses than in 2006, when it sold just under 107,000 in the United States. But the Prius is finding lots of company on the freighters from Japan. This year, Toyota has achieved double-digit and in some cases triple-digit sales increases for Japanese-made models like the Yaris, a subcompact car; the FJ Cruiser, an eye-catching sport utility vehicle; and the RAV-4, a small S.U.V. Sales are also climbing for two Japanese-made Lexus cars, the ES 350, considered the entry-level Lexus, and the flagship LS 460 sedan. Prius sales slumped in the final months of 2006 when some tax credits on the car were discontinued and gas prices fell. In January, Toyota placed its first incentives ever on the small hybrid-electric vehicle and started a national advertising campaign. Prius sales have set records since then, and Toyota is on track to meet its sales target. The automaker actually has more Priuses to sell because it has cut back on Camry production in Japan, Mr. Lentz said. Still, the chance to build the Camry here was a godsend for Fuji, whose production in Lafayette had dropped, said Ikuo Mori, the chief executive. “We are not so big of a company. We need a partner, and the partner used to be G.M.,” Mr. Mori said.

Mitch Daniels of Indiana at the Subaru plant Friday. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 21, 2007 LAFAYETTE, Ind., April 20 — The Toyota Motor Company will sell more imported vehicles in the United States this year, Toyota officials acknowledged Friday, even though the company has begun building Camry sedans at a Subaru plant here to replace those built in Japan. Toyota’s imports will rise because it expects a significant increase in sales for the hybrid-electric Prius, which it builds only in Japan, said James Lentz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. He estimated that Toyota’s total imports would probably rise by about 25,000 this year, if Toyota meets its sales targets for the Prius. To be sure, Toyota’s production in North America is also rising as it opens new factories of its own and adds production at the Subaru plant here, where it expects to build 100,000 Camrys a year. This week, it broke ground for a plant in Mississippi, its eighth assembly plant in North America. It is building a new factory in Canada and opened a plant in Texas last fall. Even so, Toyota’s imports as a percentage of its American sales have risen in the last three years, figures criticized by some supporters of Detroit’s carmakers. In 2006, 46 percent of Toyota’s vehicles were imported from Japan compared with 38.4 percent in 2005 and 37 percent in 2004. Toyota sold 2.54 million vehicles in the United States last year, a record for the automaker, which passed DaimlerChrysler to rank third behind General Motors and the Ford Motor Company. It has forecast that its American sales will rise to 2.68 million this year. About 40,000 of those vehicles will be Camrys built at the Subaru plant, owned by Fuji Heavy Industries. Toyota bought a stake in Fuji in 2005 from General Motors and immediately began looking for arrangements involving Fuji plants and the company’s engineers. It announced the deal to build Camrys here just over a year ago, investing $230 million in the project, which will add 1,000 jobs at the plant. Fuji opened the factory in 1988 to build Subaru and Isuzu vehicles. James Doyle, president of the Level Field Institute, an organization founded by retirees of the Detroit automakers, said that he was pleased to see Toyota’s investment but that it did not compare with those by Detroit companies. Toyota accounts for 9 percent of automotive manufacturing jobs in the United States and roughly 16 percent of the vehicle market, while G.M. accounts for 29 percent of the jobs and about 24 percent of the market, Mr. Doyle said. “We lose 10 for every one job that they bring,” Mr. Doyle said. And despite the start of Camry production here, Toyota will still import 60,000 Camrys from Japan this year, Mr. Lentz said. Along with that, Toyota also expects to import about 70,000 more Priuses than in 2006, when it sold just under 107,000 in the United States. But the Prius is finding lots of company on the freighters from Japan. This year, Toyota has achieved double-digit and in some cases triple-digit sales increases for Japanese-made models like the Yaris, a subcompact car; the FJ Cruiser, an eye-catching sport utility vehicle; and the RAV-4, a small S.U.V. Sales are also climbing for two Japanese-made Lexus cars, the ES 350, considered the entry-level Lexus, and the flagship LS 460 sedan. Prius sales slumped in the final months of 2006 when some tax credits on the car were discontinued and gas prices fell. In January, Toyota placed its first incentives ever on the small hybrid-electric vehicle and started a national advertising campaign. Prius sales have set records since then, and Toyota is on track to meet its sales target. The automaker actually has more Priuses to sell because it has cut back on Camry production in Japan, Mr. Lentz said. Still, the chance to build the Camry here was a godsend for Fuji, whose production in Lafayette had dropped, said Ikuo Mori, the chief executive. “We are not so big of a company. We need a partner, and the partner used to be G.M.,” Mr. Mori said. Toyota’s investment has given Subaru workers the opportunity to learn Toyota’s production methods and to train on the state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment the company has installed here, he said. Toyota, which sent manufacturing experts from Japan and the United States to help with the start of production here, is already discovering improvements it can make in its own processes by drawing on the way Subaru builds cars.

Profit Down 90% From 2006 Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 4, 2007 DETROIT, May 3 — The Corporation reported a 90 percent decline in first-quarter profit today as losses at its finance arm overshadowed the gains from restructuring its automotive operations. G.M., which fell behind the in the first quarter to become the world’s second-largest automaker, posted net income of $62 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $602 million, or $1.06 a share, in the same period a year earlier. It was the company’s second consecutive quarterly profit, but the number was weighed down heavily by losses from subprime mortgage loans made by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation G.M., which sold a majority stake in G.M.A.C. last fall to a group of investors led by Cerberus Capital Management, recorded a net loss of $115 million from G.M.A.C. — 49 percent of the unit’s $305 million loss — compared with the venture’s earnings of $495 million in the quarter a year earlier. The G.M.A.C. divestiture led to a 16 percent decline in G.M.’s first-quarter revenue, to $43.9 billion from $52.4 billion. G.M. improved its performance considerably in North America, the focus of its turnaround effort, but remained in the red. Reductions in health care spending and reductions in marginally profitable sales to rental-car companies helped G.M. narrow its North American losses to $85 million from $251 million in the first quarter of 2006. “It’s good to see the improvement, but it’s not good to be operating at a small loss,” the chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, said on a conference call with reporters and analysts this morning. “We have to continue to make significant improvements.” The loss in North America is concerning to Jonathan Steinmetz, an analyst at in New York, who had expected G.M. to instead report a $122 million profit in the region. That shortfall could signify trouble later this year if demand for vehicles softens because of high gas prices and a stumbling housing market. “G.M. is still burning cash near the peak of its product cycle,” Mr. Steinmetz wrote in a report to clients today. In 2006, G.M. cut its fixed costs in North America by $6.8 billion, largely through buyout and early retirement package offers that were accepted by about 35,000 of its hourly workers. Mr. Henderson said G.M. was on track to achieve its goal of cutting $9 billion in annual costs by the end of this year. He described the company, which reported losses of $10.4 billion in 2005 and $2 billion last year, as “operating at or close to break even.” that G.M. said were largely related to restructuring in its Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, the company earned $94 million, or 17 cents a share, well below the 87 cents a share that analysts had expected. As a result, G.M. shares were down $1.40, or 4.3 percent, to $31.04 a share at midday on the New York Stock Exchange G.M.’s stock had risen in recent days on the anticipation of a significantly improved first-quarter performance, helping drive Wall Street to record highs. But on Wednesday, analysts noted the effect of the subprime mortgage business on results at G.M.A.C., the first inkling that G.M. most likely had a disappointing quarter. G.M.’s report came a week after the reported a first-quarter loss of $282 million, compared with a loss of $1.4 billion a year earlier. Even though G.M.’s performance in the quarter was better, investors were more pleased with Ford because it improved so dramatically. The second quarter is off to a rocky start for both automakers, at least in terms of sales in the United States. Ford’s sales fell 7 percent in April, while G.M.’s were down 2 percent. “It’s fair to say the U.S. market isn’t very robust,” Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of G.M., said during an interview on CNBC, the financial news cable network, citing gas prices that have topped $3 a gallon in many parts of the country as one reason. But that is slightly less of a concern for G.M. than for Detroit’s other automakers, because G.M. now sells more than half of its vehicles abroad. Globally, G.M. increased sales 3 percent in the first quarter, to 2.26 million vehicles, but could not keep up with surging Toyota, which sold 2.35 million. G.M. had been the world’s largest automaker since 1931, save for brief periods in the 1970s and 1990s when strikes among G.M. workers allowed Ford to claim the top spot. G.M.’s biggest problem in the quarter, however, was unrelated to its core automobile business. G.M.A.C. said its mortgage division, Residential Capital, had losses of $910 million, while net income from automotive financing, insurance and other operations was $605 million, more than double the earnings those divisions generated in the first quarter of 2006. G.M.A.C. said it expected improved results from the mortgage division in the second quarter. More Articles in Business &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph Getting Connected Without Plugging In Smarter Lights, Minus the Blues To make the devices better, less distracting driving companions, more carmakers and electronics companies are using Bluetooth technology, which wirelessly connects phones to a headset or to the car’s sound system. Bluetooth is becoming the wireless standard in vehicles, and it has ambitions far beyond hands-free cellphone use. The benefit of Bluetooth is that it frees the hands of a driver talking on the phone, though it does not address the larger problem of diverted attention while holding a conversation. It allows users to leave a Bluetooth-equipped cellphone in a pocket or purse and still make and receive phone calls, either with a cordless headset or by using speakers and a microphone built into the vehicle. In addition, the voice-activated dialing with today’s cellphones can be used through a microphone in the car’s headliner with the driver’s hands on the wheel. One inspiration to use wireless Bluetooth devices in cars was the enactment of hands-free cellphone laws across the country. “The laws did help with the visibility and awareness of Bluetooth,” said Mike Foley, executive director of the Bluetooth Special Interest Group, a nonprofit trade group. California, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Washington, D.C., have all passed laws mandating the use of hands-free systems for cellphone calls. Municipalities from Florida to Utah have similar laws. Named for a 10th-century king credited with uniting warring factions of Denmark, Norway and Sweden, Bluetooth was designed to allow devices to communicate across distances of 30 feet or less. Today, every major cellphone maker includes this radio-frequency technology. And there is a wide variety of rechargeable Bluetooth headsets available from companies like Jabra, Logitech, Motorola, Nokia and Sony Ericsson. Many, however, are not designed strictly for motorists. When the headsets lose their power, for example, users often have to wait until they are at the office or home to recharge the device. One exception is Plantronics’s Discovery 665 Bluetooth Headset, which costs $150 and comes with a folding cigarette lighter charger. The tiny in-ear Discovery also uses a digital signal processor to reduce road and wind noise. Not everybody is comfortable driving with something stuck in their ear, so some automakers are offering Bluetooth as part of integrated systems. BMW, DaimlerChrysler, Ford, Honda, Nissan and Toyota offer Bluetooth in some models. The factory-installed systems allow drivers to take a call with the push of a button, like a speaker phone, while the system automatically mutes the car’s sound system. One notable laggard in Bluetooth adoption has been General Motors, which has favored its own wireless OnStar system. Only G.M.’s Cadillac STS has Bluetooth, but that may be about to change. G.M. “is developing Bluetooth in a wide range of products,” said Pete Barkey, a company spokesman. He declined to provide a timetable for its introduction in other models. Other carmakers and consumer electronics companies are looking to expand Bluetooth’s wireless possibilities. “The original scenario was purely hands-free operation,” said Mr. Foley, the trade group executive. “Now it’s pretty common to be able to synchronize a phone’s contacts with the car setup.” This allows drivers to dial a number simply by saying the person’s name. They can also see who’s calling on the vehicle’s stereo display. More cellphones, music players and headsets are also supporting Bluetooth’s Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP), which allows devices to play stereo music through a car’s sound system without wires.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 IN the Johnny Cash song &#8220;A Boy Named Sue,&#8221; the protagonist is inspired by the revelation that his deadbeat dad gave him that awful name because, &#8220;I knew you&#8217;d have to get tough or die.&#8221; Perhaps that&#8217;s the rationale for saddling the otherwise appealing 2008 Land Rover LR2 with a rather unappealing name. Yes, the LR2&#8217;s stablemate, the LR3, carries an equally mundane designation. But the anonymity that comes with such a cipher of a label has helped the LR3 remain somewhat under the radar as it has compiled one of the auto industry&#8217;s lamest reliability records. Time will tell whether the LR2 transcends its potentially fateful family ties (Swedish engineering, Ford penny-pinching, British &#8220;reliability&#8221;) or is destined like the LR3 to remain a bottom-feeder in J. D. Power&#8217;s quality ratings. At least the LR2 wasn&#8217;t named Freelander, after the model it succeeds. That name, and the troubled model to which it was attached, had even more baggage. In what may have been the final nail in the Freelander&#8217;s coffin, at least in the United States, The Associated Press mistakenly called it the &#8220;Freeloader.&#8221; (Outside North America, the LR2 will be called Freelander 2.) The LR2 is one of those clean-sheet-of-paper designs, which means, a Land Rover engineer assured me, &#8220;It shares not a single part with the outgoing Freelander.&#8221; Doesn&#8217;t that sound like a catchy advertising slogan? The Freeload, er, Freelander arrived in the colonies in 2001; its sales peaked the next year at 15,000 units. Oblivion gradually followed, as with each sale it alienated another customer &#151; not just from the reliability-challenged Freelander, but from the entire Land Rover brand. Likewise, the larger LR3, which replaced the Discovery, was meant to lure back some of the disgruntled former owners that the Discovery&#8217;s quality gremlins had chased away, but its high price (relative to the Discovery) and comparably appalling reliability caused even more defections. Somewhat surprisingly, overall sales for the Land Rover brand are robust, thanks to the top-end Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models so adored by the landed gentry. As the brand&#8217;s latest good-will ambassador, the LR2 looks the part. The upright greenhouse, broad shoulders and fender gills scream Land Rover; the LR2 also retains some Freelander cues, particularly at the front. The LR2 is Land Rover&#8217;s only car-based utility vehicle; it is built on Ford Motor&#8217;s new EUCD platform, a derivative of the C1 platform for midsize automobiles. Volvo has done extensive subsequent engineering on EUCD, the structure that currently underpins the Volvo S80. Contrary to some reports, this platform is not shared by the Ford Escape or Mazda Tribute, although redesigned 2009 Escapes and Tributes will use it. This platform has a lower center of gravity than the old Freelander chassis. But larger wheels and tires cause a tiny overall increase in the LR2&#8217;s tipping point. A wider track, however, offsets the gravity issue. In short, the LR2 feels a lot more firmly planted than the Freelander did. In my testing, the LR2 rode rock solid, and there are reasons for that: a longer wheelbase, a 40 percent improvement in torsional rigidity, a fully independent suspension and quick rack-and-pinion steering (only 2.6 turns lock-to-lock). Land Rover says it tested and tuned the LR2&#8217;s handling at the N&#252;rburgring racetrack in Germany. The steering felt a bit heavy &#151; Land Rover confirmed that this was intentional &#151; but I prefer a little resistance in wheeling around a heavy-duty vehicle. Through high-speed corners, the steering maintained a consistent line, without constant need for driver adjustments. Body lean and sway were remarkably minimal, at least for a Land Rover. Among entry-level luxury S.U.V.&#8217;s, the LR2&#8217;s handling should be competitive, although the BMW X3 remains the class valedictorian.

The industry faces the possibility of stiffer environmental rules. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 19, 2007 WASHINGTON, April 18 — Nissan Motor will offer its flagship Maxima sedan with a cleaner-burning diesel engine in the United States by 2010, the company’s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said on Wednesday, offering new details of a plan intended to resonate with environmentally conscious consumers and help Nissan meet new emissions rules. The timing of Nissan’s announcement and a visit here by Mr. Ghosn to meet with lawmakers and lobbyists — coming as the auto industry faces the possibility of stiffer environmental regulations — suggests that the automaker is looking to polish its image as a green company. Nissan, which would not be the first automaker to offer cleaner diesel technology in the United States, has been slower than other Japanese automakers in developing green technology. While Toyota and Honda have sold gasoline-electric hybrid models for years, Nissan did not begin selling one until January. But Mr. Ghosn said that consumer tastes and looming federal guidelines gave the company ample reasons to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles. “The global automotive industry has a responsibility to be part of the solutions that increase fuel efficiency,” he said in a speech here at the Council on Foreign Relations . He noted that the diesel Maxima would have up to 30 percent better fuel economy than the standard gasoline version. “We will be ready to offer our customers what they want.” Modern diesel technology, already widespread in Europe, is slowly making its way to the United States. The new engines are a far cry from the coughing, stinking diesel engines of the past, and have lower greenhouse gas emissions and better fuel economy than gasoline engines. offers a new-era diesel engine in the Mercedes E-Class, and has plans to start selling a diesel Grand Cherokee this year. , Honda, Audi, Volkswagen and BMW have plans sell diesel engines that meet federal guidelines in the future. But diesel engines have been less popular in Japan. Mr. Ghosn said on Wednesday that Nissan plans to sell the new diesel vehicles in Japan and China by 2010. Nissan has not said what percentage of its Maxima fleet in the United States or abroad would have diesel engines. Daniel F. Becker, director of the program, said the new engine would allow Nissan to make up for some of its past environmental missteps. “There are a number of categories in which Nissan is sort of a laggard among the Japanese leaders,” he said. “It’s good news that Nissan is trying to find ways to improve its environmental performance. If they follow the lead of Honda and Toyota, it can bring much cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles to market and make more money doing it.” With its sales and overall performance in a slump, Nissan is taking a hard look at what does, and does not, sell. “Consumers want environmentally friendly cars,” Mr. Ghosn said. “They want to have the pleasure of driving without the guilt.” Later, in answer to questions from reporters, Mr. Ghosn made it clear that the company would not buy Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler, which is looking at spinning off the money-losing division. “Some people are a little worried about Nissan,” he said. “So you don’t want to engage in anything like this.” He declined to address why the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz did not seem to be working. Mr. Ghosn has faced questions himself about whether the alliance of Nissan and the French carmaker Renault is a failure. “If you want to know the reality, you have to be inside,” he said, adding that even from the inside, it is not always easy to tell why the business is stumbling. “The execution of alliances is something that’s extremely delicate.” Mr. Ghosn also offered his thoughts on the troubles in the American auto industry, which he said are probably cyclical. “We are used to hitting bumps and reflecting on them,” he said. “Hitting bumps is normal in our industry.” He added: “The mistake is to say, ‘Don’t worry. There’s no problem.’ ” Next Article in Automobiles (28 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Brower/Bloomberg News Alan R. Mulally, left, Ford&#146;s chief executive, conferred with William Clay Ford, the executive chairman, at the annual shareholders&#146; meeting. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WILMINGTON, Del., May 10 &#151; A group of shareholders took turns blaming the company&#8217;s executive chairman, William Clay Ford Jr. , at the annual meeting Thursday, criticizing every decision he made as the former chief executive except one. That was his decision last September to hire a executive, Alan R. Mulally, as his successor. Mr. Mulally, 61, a boyish-looking aeronautical engineer who worked for Boeing for 37 years and rose to become its senior vice president, was widely credited with rescuing its commercial airline division from its economic troubles after the events of 9/11. &#8220;Alan knows what it&#8217;s like to have your back to the wall, and fight your way out with a well-conceived plan and great execution,&#8221; Mr. Ford has said. Now Ford has its back to the wall, with a $12.7 billion loss in 2006, seven consecutive quarterly losses and a shrinking market share. Mr. Mulally, alternating between empathy with shareholder concerns and optimism for the company&#8217;s &#8220;Way Forward&#8221; recovery plan, urged the 79 shareholders who gathered for the meeting at the Hotel du Pont to have patience, and promised results &#8220;in the months and the years ahead.&#8221; &#8220;We are moving quickly and making real progress,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But it&#8217;s going to take time to turn things around.&#8221; The automaker, based in Detroit, has borrowed $23.5 billion to help finance accelerated product development and a reduction in operating costs that includes closing 16 plants and eliminating 44,000 jobs by 2012. A provision of the loan, which is secured by assets that include the company&#8217;s trademark blue oval logo, effectively bars Ford from paying dividends until 2013 or until the loan is paid off, a spokeswoman, Becky Sanch, said. Shareholders voting by proxy re-elected the 12 current board members with 95.9 percent of the votes cast. All seven shareholder proposals failed, including those calling for a reduction in greenhouse gases, performance-based compensation for executives and health care as a fiduciary duty. But support increased for a proposal to extinguish the Ford family&#8217;s 40 percent voting control through their supervoting shares by recapitalizing all outstanding stock to one vote per share. The proposal won 27.4 percent of the vote this year, up from 22.9 percent in 2006. After the meeting, Mr. Mulally told reporters that as a global company, Ford was &#8220;absolutely supporting free trade,&#8221; notwithstanding the increasing market share in North America of its rival Toyota. He also acknowledged that there would be industry consolidation because of market overcapacity. When asked if there had been talk of a merger at Ford, Ms. Sanch said, &#8220;There has been a lot of speculation. But it&#8217;s nothing we&#8217;re interested in. We&#8217;re focused on turning around our business, not on any type of merger or acquisition.&#8221; She said she knew of no contact from a potential buyer.

The Sales Pitch, Minus Salesmen The Cal Worthington Collection Appearing with animals was a staple of Mr. Worthington's ads. HI, folks, Cal Worthington here,&#8221; said the voice from the television set. It was 1950; our family had just become the first on the block to buy a television set. When we turned it on, one of the first faces that popped up on its little round screen was a tall, skinny cowboy in a white hat selling used cars. In the background, singers chanted: &#8220;Go see Cal, go see Cal, go see Cal.&#8221; Fifty-seven years later, that same cowboy &#151; still wearing a Stetson &#151; is still on television here, still selling cars. Who is this guy? Dorian Gray? &#8220;I&#8217;m 86 now,&#8221; said Calvin Coolidge Worthington, in a down-home drawl, during a telephone conversation from his 24,000-acre ranch in Orland, Calif., about 100 miles north of Sacramento. &#8220;Born in November 1920 in Oklahoma, seventh of nine kids in my family. I&#8217;ve actually been selling cars since 1945.&#8221; In the meantime, Mr. Worthington has been married three times and had six children: the oldest is 60, the youngest is 6. Cal Worthington has also become a legend in auto dealerships, selling cars throughout the American West from Texas to Alaska. By his count, he&#8217;s sold more than a million cars &#151; nearly every make and model ever made &#151; and grossed billions of dollars. Every fair-size city in America has probably had its own version of the fast-talking used-car salesman, usually distinguished by a 14-carat smile, a loud sport coat and a bad comb-over. Southern California had a bumper crop of these flamboyant television pitchmen in the 1950s, including halo-wearing &#8220;Honest John&#8221; and &#8220;Wild Hog Tony,&#8221; two characters portrayed by Tony Holzer, and Earl Muntz . With his good looks, folksy charm and his dog, Spot &#151; who never looked much like a dog &#151; Mr. Worthington always seemed a cut above that crowd, though he was an integral part of it. It was those TV ads that made Mr. Worthington a cultural icon. The ads made him a minor Hollywood celebrity and led the Television Bureau of Advertising to cite him as &#8220;probably the best-known car dealer pitchman in television history.&#8221; Mr. Worthington recalled pioneers like Muntz. &#8220;Those guys are all dead now. You know, I actually bought my first dealership from Madman Muntz!&#8221; Despite Detroit&#8217;s uphill battle for sales, Mr. Worthington says he&#8217;s partial to American cars. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;m a redneck at heart,&#8221; he said with a chuckle. &#8220;Color me red, white and blue.&#8221; But he&#8217;s not sentimental; he knows how to make a buck. &#8220;Most dealers make about 1.6 percent on every car they sell; I make about 2.4 percent because I&#8217;ve learned to do it more efficiently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That may not sound like much until you multiply it by a million cars.&#8221; It has been enough to buy him dozens of dealerships, an office building, three shopping centers and eight huge ranches. He also operates his own advertising agency, television studio and finance company. &#8220;I&#8217;ve scaled back a bit on the dealerships; I own just four now,&#8221; Mr. Worthington explained. He and I had agreed that the next time he flew his Learjet 35 into town we would meet at his Ford dealership here, where the walls are a gallery of photos from more than a half-century of his famous television ads. Mr. Worthington showed up the very next week and greeted me with a firm handshake and a steady gaze from steel-blue eyes. He&#8217;s still Marlboro Man handsome, about 6-foot-4, lean as the day he left the Army Air Force in 1945, and he still has a full head of hair &#151; little of it gray &#151; under that ever-present Stetson. Mr. Worthington came to Southern California in 1948 after a much-decorated military career piloting B-17 Flying Fortresses on 29 combat missions over Germany. He made enough selling used cars to start trading in war surplus. That&#8217;s what brought him to California, where it took him nearly two years to sell a ship full of corroded welding equipment he&#8217;d bought. He cleared $13,000, which was enough to buy a Muntz dealership. Next Article in Automobiles (38 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

HI, folks, Cal Worthington here,&#8221; said the voice from the television set. It was 1950; our family had just become the first on the block to buy a television set. When we turned it on, one of the first faces that popped up on its little round screen was a tall, skinny cowboy in a white hat selling used cars. In the background, singers chanted: &#8220;Go see Cal, go see Cal, go see Cal.&#8221; Fifty-seven years later, that same cowboy &#151; still wearing a Stetson &#151; is still on television here, still selling cars.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/automobiles/10toyota.html?ex=1336449600&en=879157377f34e9e2&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss	Toyota Posts Another Record but Warns of Slowdown - New York Times Toyota Posts Another Record but Warns of Slowdown Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 10, 2007 TOKYO, May 9 — Toyota reported another year of record profit on Wednesday but signaled a slowdown in the current year because of weakness in North America and increased spending. Skip to next paragraph Toyota is poised to supplant General Motors as the world&#146;s largest carmaker. A vehicle is repaired at a Toyota dealership in Singapore. While American rivals like General Motors and Ford have reported losses of billions of dollars in recent years, Toyota announced its seventh consecutive year of record earnings, bolstered by the popularity of its fuel-efficient vehicles. Toyota said net profit jumped about 20 percent in the fiscal year ended in March, to 1.64 trillion yen ($13.68 billion). The results showed Toyota to be in robust shape as it prepares to end G.M.’s 76-year reign as the world’s largest automaker this year. Toyota reiterated its forecast of 9.34 million vehicle sales this calendar year for its entire group, which includes the minicar maker Daihatsu Motor and the truck maker Hino. In terms of annual sales, that would be enough to put it ahead of G.M., which expects to sell 9.2 million vehicles this year. Yet, despite last year’s strong showing, Toyota struck a cautious note in its forecast for the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2008. The company said it expected a modest 0.4 percent rise in net profit, to 1.65 trillion yen ($13.76 billion). The company attributed the forecast to what it called a “severe market” in North America, where Toyota earns about 60 percent of its profits. Toyota said it expected sales growth this year in North America to slow to 1.6 percent, down from 15.1 percent last year. Toyota also cited increased spending to build factories and develop new vehicles and technologies, like its popular gas-electric hybrids and more futuristic hydrogen-powered fuel-cell engines. The slowdown in profit growth “is temporary, as we are planting the seeds” of future growth, Toyota’s president, Katsuaki Watanabe, told reporters. “Earnings will improve again.” But some analysts called the forecast overly conservative. They said that while they expect profit growth to slow this year, Toyota may be giving a low estimate in order to reduce potential political fallout from its strong performance, particularly in the United States. Analysts pointed out that Toyota is still forecasting strong gains this year in the number of vehicles sold, up more than a half million vehicles from 2006; that, they said, should also lead to higher profits. Moreover, analysts noted that Toyota has made overly conservative profit forecasts before. A year ago, Toyota said it expected profits to drop in the recently ended fiscal year — the same period that produced the robust earnings growth announced Wednesday. Analysts estimated that net profit in the current fiscal year will most likely be closer to 1.74 trillion yen ($14.51 billion). “Toyota doesn’t see any upside in showing how strong it really is,” said Atsushi Kawai, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities in Tokyo. “It wants to avoid inviting jealousy and other negative reactions.” These concerns have been particularly acute in the United States, where control of Congress has recently shifted to traditionally labor-friendly Democrats. Many in Japan have worried that this could lead to fresh protectionist measures to control America’s ballooning trade deficit. Because of its size and growth, Toyota has felt particularly vulnerable to any possible trade retaliation. Like many Asian carmakers, Toyota has hired Washington lobbyists and invested billions in new plants in the United States in hopes of avoiding the sort of criticism it faced during the Japanese-American trade friction in the early 1990s. Toyota is scheduled to open its eighth North American factory in Mississippi in 2010. Mr. Watanabe, Toyota’s president, also tried to play down Toyota’s prospects of beating G.M. “Rather than think about other companies, I feel we must do our best to satisfy our worldwide customers,” he said. “There is still plenty for us to do.” Still, the results clearly painted a picture that has become all too familiar in the auto industry: Toyota roaring ahead as the Detroit automakers stumble. In addition to its strong annual earnings, Toyota posted an 8.9 percent gain in net profit in the January-March quarter, to 440.1 billion yen ($3.67 billion), as strong sales in the United States and Europe offset declines in Asia. By contrast, G.M. reported losses of $2 billion last year, after a $10.4 billion loss the year before. Ford reported losses of $12.7 billion last year and is not expected to turn a profit in North America before 2009. Chrysler, the unit of DaimlerChrysler, said that its loss was $1.5 billion last year. Toyota also gained on G.M. by another measure: size of annual revenue. Toyota said revenue last year rose 13.8 percent, to 23.95 trillion yen ($199.77 billion), just slightly behind G.M.’s revenue last year of $207 billion. In the current fiscal year, Toyota forecast a 4.4 percent rise in revenue, to 25 trillion yen ($208.52 billion). In North America, Toyota benefited from strong sales of its Lexus luxury line, RAV4 light sports utility vehicle and Camry sedan, the best-selling car in the United States for a fifth consecutive year. Toyota said vehicles sales in North America rose by 386,000 vehicles from the year before, to 2.9 million vehicles. To keep up with demand, Toyota has added Camry production at the Indiana plant of its affiliate, Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru. Toyota said it also planned to produce Camrys in Russia for sale there and elsewhere in Europe. Toyota said it expected sales to pick up this year in Asia outside China and Japan, where they dropped by 91,000 vehicles last year, to 789,000. The automaker also said it would increase spending this year to develop new cars and technologies by 5.5 percent to 940 billion yen ($7.84 billion).

The vehicle has failed to generate the sales that Ford&#146;s big sport utility vehicles once did. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 2, 2007 DETROIT, May 1 — Is the Edge giving Ford the edge it was hoping for? Skip to next paragraph At the very least, the new crossover vehicle is keeping sales at the Ford Motor Company from dropping even more than they already are this year, at a time when the company is pulling back on unprofitable sales to rental-car companies. Ford is meeting the expectations it set for the Edge when the vehicle went on sale in December. But the Edge is not generating the revenue of the big sport utility vehicles that once fueled Ford’s profits, and it is not drawing the new customers that the company will need to bounce back from its worst loss in history — $12.7 billion last year. Ford’s falling sales have allowed the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan to replace it as the second-largest seller of vehicles in the United States, after General Motors, through the first four months. And there is the question of buzz: Ford has pulled out all the stops to promote the Edge, with television ads directed by the playwright David Mamet in its latest attempt to get attention for the vehicle. Yet there are already lease deals available for the Edge, and some Ford insiders are concerned that its price, which starts at $25,995, is too high to sustain current sales levels once the vehicle’s novelty wears off — further proof that in today’s ultra-competitive car market, automakers have only a brief window to make a splash. Since arriving at dealerships in December, the Edge has been one of the few bright spots for Ford. On Tuesday, when automakers reported sales for April, Ford said its overall sales in April fell 7 percent on a selling-day adjusted basis; a distinction made because a year ago, there were two more selling days in April. Without the Edge and two other new crossovers in its lineup, Ford’s decline last month would have been 12 percent, the worst among major automakers. Ford has sold 33,600 units of the Edge so far this year, on pace for its goal of selling 100,000 units in all of 2007. But the company’s chief sales analyst, George Pipas, said many of those had been bought by people who already owned Fords. “The products that are most traded in are other Ford products,” Mr. Pipas said. “It’s retaining Ford buyers who were in traditional S.U.V.’s that are moving into another category.” To be sure, Ford needed vehicles that could keep its customers from defecting to other brands, particularly as high gasoline prices lead consumers to seek more fuel-efficient vehicles. But the Edge alone can do little to help Ford reach its goal of earning a profit in North America by 2009. “Crossovers are not the cash cows that the Ford Explorers and Expeditions were,” said Ron Pinelli, president of the Autodata Corporation, the industry research company based in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. “There’s just not enough volume there for Ford to make up for what they’ve lost,” Mr. Pinelli said. “Even if the Edge is doing incredibly well, the profit contribution isn’t going to be terrific, and there aren’t going to be enough of them to move the scale from the loss side to the profit side.” The Edge was not enough to stop Ford’s market share from falling to 17 percent from 18 percent a year ago, according to Autodata; the decline was the largest among all major automakers. G.M.’s market share slipped to 23 percent from 23.5 percent, while the Chrysler Group had a rare increase, to 14.4 percent from 13.1 percent. Toyota leads all automakers in worldwide sales. Chrysler, which could be sold in the coming months by its German parent, DaimlerChrysler, surprised analysts by saying its April sales rose 10 percent. Chrysler executives attributed the gain to a well-organized incentive program, including free DVD players in its minivans and discounts on the Dodge Ram pickup, as well as a successful 96-hour sale at the end of the month. “We were just very fortunate to catch the wind when we did in April,” said Steven J. Landry, Chrysler’s executive vice president for North American sales and global marketing. “We had a very strong close.” Meanwhile, Japanese automakers had an uncharacteristically weak month, with Honda’s sales down 1.6 percent and Nissan’s down 11.2 percent. Toyota posted a 3.7 percent sales increase, its lowest year-over-year gain since August 2004. Although Ford came in slightly ahead of it for the month, Toyota has sold nearly 5,000 more vehicles than Ford so far this year. Yet there are signs of some bumps in the road for Toyota, like an inventory that has grown 30 percent in the last year. Many of those unsold vehicles may be the new Tundra pickups; Toyota has sold about 43,000 Tundras since the truck went on sale in February, well below the pace needed to reach its goal of selling 200,000 this year. But because the Tundra makes more money for Toyota than the Edge does for Ford, the Edge cannot necessarily be called the more successful of the two. Still, Ford and its dealers say they are thrilled with the Edge. Mr. Pipas of Ford said it was competing well against crossover models from Toyota, Honda and Nissan. “The sales levels, really coming from having no brand recognition, are kind of in the same sandbox as three really great products that have established themselves over the course of several years,” Mr. Pipas said. “I don’t know if I thought we could get there that soon.” Ron Christiano, general manager of Cortese Ford in Rochester, said customers liked the Edge because it used less gas than an S.U.V. The Edge increased traffic to the dealership more quickly than Ford’s Fusion sedan, which has sold well since its introduction in 2005, he said.

Streamlining was a modernist trend, with toasters, typewriters, vacuum cleaners and even buildings designed to evoke a future of speed. “That was how we came up with the idea of looking at the streamline design of the ’30s,” Jim Ballinger, the museum’s director, said in a recent interview. “It was so pervasive in the art world. The actual science of aerodynamics was having an impact, but ultimately, it’s the stylization of that.” Working with art and automotive experts, the Arizona museum has assembled a collection of 22 automobiles, many of them landmark designs from the 1930s. Later cars in the collection show how aerodynamics developed and was used to real effect in land-speed record attempts, in racecars and in one of the most exotic supercars, the McLaren F1. The queen of the exhibition is the voluptuous 1939 Delahaye Type 165 designed by Giuseppi Figoni in what could be the pinnacle of coach-built artistry. The enormous cabriolet seems to float above the surface, surreal sexuality glistening in its gleaming red paint. The star of France’s display at the 1939 World’s Fair, its presence is no less jaw-dropping today. In the Depression-wracked 1930s, the reality was that most vehicles were boxy contraptions. But curvaceous streamlined cars like these embodied dreams of affluence. The Phoenix Art Museum is no stranger to rare historic automobiles; the Copperstate 1000 vintage-car road rally has raised money for the museum for 17 years. For Curves of Steel, the museum borrowed the cars from private collections and auto museums around the country. One featured car, a 1934 Chrysler Imperial Airflow, was driven to the museum by its owner. The cars are displayed in a stark gallery, each on a raised platform to enhance the sense of a sculpture exhibition. The only extraneous items are captions that appear below each car, explaining how it came to be and its role in auto design. Four automobiles are outside the gallery, the robust teardrop form of the 1935 Stout Scarab greeting visitors as they enter the museum. A rakish 1957 Ferrari 625/250 Testa Rossa crouches near the entrance. French automotive art of the 1930s is lavishly represented. The 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic, with its riveted aluminum structure, was a groundbreaking design by Jean Bugatti, son of the company’s legendary founder, Ettore. Nearby stands the lush form of the 1938 Talbot-Lago T150C, a rendition of perfection from the coachbuilders Figoni & Falaschi. There is also the sophisticated urban shape of the 1936 Peugeot 402 Darl’mat and the dramatically aeronautical 1937 Dubonnet Hispano-Suiza H-6c Xenia. The American cars show how streamlining made its way into production vehicles, with classics like the 1935 Auburn 851 Boattail Speedster, the 1937 Cord 812 Sportsman and the 1939 Lincoln Zephyr, advertised as looking as though it were going 60 miles an hour even when standing still. A more down-to-earth vehicle is the ’34 Chrysler Imperial, a bold attempt to bring steamlining to the showroom. But despite a shape that looks so interesting today, the Airflow was a commercial failure; many ended up as taxicabs. In contrast, the 1948 Tatra T87, a radically finned sedan from Czechoslovakia, had a long, successful run after its debut in 1934. “We wanted to do a show on automotive design the same way we do a great art exhibit, so that the exhibit is also a contribution to the field,” Mr. Ballinger said. Phil Patton, a freelance design writer who frequently contributes to The New York Times, was a curatorial consultant for the exhibition. The museum is offering a series of lectures about the exhibition and the role of streamlining in design.

The actual science of aerodynamics was having an impact, but ultimately, it’s the stylization of that.” Working with art and automotive experts, the Arizona museum has assembled a collection of 22 automobiles, many of them landmark designs from the 1930s. Later cars in the collection show how aerodynamics developed and was used to real effect in land-speed record attempts, in racecars and in one of the most exotic supercars, the McLaren F1. The queen of the exhibition is the voluptuous 1939 Delahaye Type 165 designed by Giuseppi Figoni in what could be the pinnacle of coach-built artistry. The enormous cabriolet seems to float above the surface, surreal sexuality glistening in its gleaming red paint. The star of France’s display at the 1939 World’s Fair, its presence is no less jaw-dropping today. In the Depression-wracked 1930s, the reality was that most vehicles were boxy contraptions. But curvaceous streamlined cars like these embodied dreams of affluence. The Phoenix Art Museum is no stranger to rare historic automobiles; the Copperstate 1000 vintage-car road rally has raised money for the museum for 17 years. For Curves of Steel, the museum borrowed the cars from private collections and auto museums around the country. One featured car, a 1934 Chrysler Imperial Airflow, was driven to the museum by its owner. The cars are displayed in a stark gallery, each on a raised platform to enhance the sense of a sculpture exhibition. The only extraneous items are captions that appear below each car, explaining how it came to be and its role in auto design. Four automobiles are outside the gallery, the robust teardrop form of the 1935 Stout Scarab greeting visitors as they enter the museum. A rakish 1957 Ferrari 625/250 Testa Rossa crouches near the entrance. French automotive art of the 1930s is lavishly represented. The 1936 Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic, with its riveted aluminum structure, was a groundbreaking design by Jean Bugatti, son of the company’s legendary founder, Ettore. Nearby stands the lush form of the 1938 Talbot-Lago T150C, a rendition of perfection from the coachbuilders Figoni & Falaschi. There is also the sophisticated urban shape of the 1936 Peugeot 402 Darl’mat and the dramatically aeronautical 1937 Dubonnet Hispano-Suiza H-6c Xenia. The American cars show how streamlining made its way into production vehicles, with classics like the 1935 Auburn 851 Boattail Speedster, the 1937 Cord 812 Sportsman and the 1939 Lincoln Zephyr, advertised as looking as though it were going 60 miles an hour even when standing still. A more down-to-earth vehicle is the ’34 Chrysler Imperial, a bold attempt to bring steamlining to the showroom. But despite a shape that looks so interesting today, the Airflow was a commercial failure; many ended up as taxicabs. In contrast, the 1948 Tatra T87, a radically finned sedan from Czechoslovakia, had a long, successful run after its debut in 1934. “We wanted to do a show on automotive design the same way we do a great art exhibit, so that the exhibit is also a contribution to the field,” Mr. Ballinger said. Phil Patton, a freelance design writer who frequently contributes to The New York Times, was a curatorial consultant for the exhibition. The museum is offering a series of lectures about the exhibition and the role of streamlining in design.

The variety and sophistication of the cars showed a striking improvement not just since the last Shanghai auto show two years ago, when Chinese automakers demonstrated scant technological innovation, but even in the months since the Beijing auto show last November. Universities and technical institutes across China have started advanced vehicle propulsion research programs, combining strong government financial backing with China’s growing ranks of skilled engineers. China, worried about severe air pollution and rising dependence on imported oil, has already imposed more stringent fuel economy standards than the United States — although not as strict as the semi-voluntary standards in the China plans to tighten its standards considerably next year. It has raised its consumption tax to as much as 20 percent on gas guzzlers, while cutting it to 1 percent for cars with small fuel-sipping engines. And it is studying the possibility of tax incentives for buyers of hybrids. and Volkswagen have begun cooperating closely with Chinese joint venture partners on the development of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles. Larry Burns, G.M.’s vice president for research and development, said the company was in talks with a Chinese joint venture partner on sharing hydrogen fuel-cell technology as well. Xu Liuping, the chief executive of Changan Automobile in Chongqing, said the Chinese auto industry was hard working to save energy. “The speed will be accelerated because available energy supplies are dwindling and because of the environmental protection aspect,” Mr. Xu said in an interview at the Shanghai auto show. Changan showed a hybrid gasoline-electric minivan here. Mr. Xu said that he had lined up local governments that promised to use it, making it possible for Changan to start manufacturing the vehicle next year. Rick Wagoner, G.M.’s chairman and chief executive, and Nick Reilly, the president of G.M.’s Asian and Pacific regional operations, met on Thursday with senior Chinese officials in Beijing to discuss the company’s energy efficiency plans, Mr. Reilly said. The Chinese government has not chosen among options like electric battery cars, fuel cells, hybrids and ethanol combustion, but wants the industry to move quickly to find the best approach and adopt it. “It’s absolutely at the top of the agenda” of the Chinese leadership, Mr. Reilly said. Western environmentalists have long speculated whether China may actually leapfrog the West in personal transportation by embracing new automotive technologies before the country’s oil and auto industries can become too wedded to internal combustion engines. The odds of such a leapfrogging have eroded because nobody has yet surmounted the technological obstacles that prevent a broad switch from gasoline technology to hydrogen fuel cells, said An Feng, the executive director of the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation in Beijing. Japanese companies, particularly Toyota and Honda, are already far ahead in the hybrid gasoline-electric designs that have proved more attractive lately to Chinese companies than fuel cells, said Kelly Sims Gallagher, the director of the Energy Technology Innovation Project at Harvard. Japanese companies also control many crucial patents on hybrid technology. Multinational automakers face repeated demands from Chinese joint venture partners to share the most advanced technology available. Katsumi Nakamura, the president and chief executive of Dongfeng Motor, a joint venture in Hubei Province between Nissan and the Dongfeng Group of China, said the Dongfeng side had tried to negotiate an agreement that would require the sharing of the latest technology. But at Nissan’s insistence, the final pact calls only for the sharing of “appropriate” technology. Auto executives are reluctant to mention the illegal copying of technology in China, a problem that discouraged Chrysler from even trying to build minivans in China in the 1990s. China’s vehicle market is now the second largest in the world, after the United States, and still expanding. It grew another 34 percent in the first two months of this year compared with the period a year earlier. Automakers have decided to risk the occasional piracy of existing designs but are still wary of sharing future technologies.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 6, 2007 LAST year, when Nathalie Guiraudet heard that Toyota was making the next-generation Tundra much bigger, she began to fret about her vehicular future. Skip to next paragraph She thought the size of her 2002 Tundra was perfect for her needs. She could haul plenty of hay for her horse, Kismet. It was easy to back up (the truck, not Kismet) and the fuel economy was acceptable (both the Tundra and Kismet). But Toyota has its own needs, and these include growth. By finally offering a pickup big and powerful enough to compete with the Ford F-150 and the Chevrolet Silverado, Toyota says it might double Tundra sales, which totaled an unimpressive 124,500 in 2006, just a fraction of what Chevrolet or Ford sold. While Ms. Guiraudet, who lives in Bethlehem, N.H., a town of 2,300 about 150 miles north of Boston, did not wish to interfere with Toyota&#8217;s apparent plan for galactic domination, she was dismayed. &#8220;It is like every good television show I ever liked,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It gets taken off the air.&#8221; So she responded to Toyota&#8217;s plan with a pre-emptive purchase: she bought a 2006 Tundra Access Cab. Now the 2007 Tundra is on sale, assembled at plants in Indiana and Texas. The new model is about 5 inches taller, 4 inches wider and 10 inches longer than its equivalent predecessors. Gone is the front-end styling so reserved it suggested a meek effort to assimilate, not cause trouble. The 2007 design could not be more confrontational if it had revolvers mounted on the fenders like one of Roy Rogers&#8217;s cars. For Tundra, three is a recurring theme. There are three bed sizes, three cabs and three engines. The standard bed is 6-foot-7; the long bed is 8-foot-2; and the short bed is 5-foot-7. There is a Regular Cab with comfortable seating for two and a surprising amount of cargo space behind the seats. The Double Cab has just enough room for four six-foot adults to be comfortable; access to the rear is through short forward-hinged doors. Last is the four-door CrewMax, imposing because the cab is so large it suggests an auditorium on wheels. Inside there is so much room it feels more like a large sport utility than a pickup. Its amazing 44.5 inches of rear legroom is almost 10 inches more than the Double Cab&#8217;s, making it entirely suitable for family transportation. A 236-horsepower 4-liter V-6 is available, but only on two-wheel drive Regular Cab and Double Cab models. With a five-speed automatic, it is rated at 17 m.p.g. in town and 20 on the highway, which is less than last year. A 4.7-liter V-8 is rated at 271 horsepower at 5,400 r.p.m. and 313 pound-feet of torque at 3,400 r.p.m. It comes with a five-speed automatic. Despite the increase in the Tundra&#8217;s size, the fuel economy estimate is unchanged from last year: 15 m.p.g. city and 18 highway for a four-wheel drive. New this year is a 5.7-liter V-8 rated at 381 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m. and 401 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 r.p.m. It comes with a six-speed automatic. Demand for this engine &#151; more than 70 percent of new Tundras have it &#151; has been greater than expected. With four-wheel drive, this engine is rated at 14 m.p.g. city and 18 highway. I averaged 18 m.p.g. on a 239-mile Interstate cruise at 65 m.p.h. Prices on the Tundra start at $22,935 for a two-wheel drive Regular Cab. The least expensive four-wheel-drive model is a Regular Cab, at $27,125. The most expensive Tundra is $42,495: that&#8217;s the CrewMax with four-wheel drive and the 5.7-liter V-8. The Tundra&#8217;s base prices are high compared with the new Chevrolet Silverado&#8217;s. But the Tundra offers more standard equipment on base models, including life savers like an electronic stability control to deal with skids and side curtains to provide head protection in a side-impact crash. My test truck was a Double Cab in the midlevel SR5 trim. It had the standard bed, four-wheel drive and the 5.7-liter V-8. The base price was $31,805. Options included an upgraded stereo and power front seats, bringing the total to $34,648. Toyota says the design and engineering were done in the United States, so it is not surprising that the front seats are wide American-size berths.

Dith Pran/The New York Times Rick Zitarosa cites a hydrogen leak. The New York Times Hindenburg, three times as long as a Boeing 747, being prepared in Germany for its first test flight in 1936. It was destroyed the next year on its 63rd flight. THE May 6, 1937, crash of the Hindenburg at the Navy base here was the 20th century&#8217;s first transportation disaster captured by newsreel, audio recordings and still photos. The advancement in communications, combined with the observations of more than a thousand witnesses and survivors, is why one calamity with a relatively modest death toll permanently soiled hydrogen&#8217;s reputation. In 34 fiery seconds, hydrogen leaped from the No. 1 position on the periodic table of elements to the last thing any citizen would consider pumping into a car&#8217;s fuel tank. But was hydrogen really to blame? Over the last seven decades, countless inquiries, investigations, books, movies, television reports and Internet postings have attempted to answer that question. After weighing the evidence, Rick Zitarosa, 45, of Point Pleasant, N.J., said he thought he knew the cause of the Hindenburg&#8217;s demise. Mr. Zitarosa, a supervisor for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority , is not a scientist, engineer or lawyer. But since he read a book on the subject as a 10-year old, his passion has been the study of airships in general and the Hindenburg in particular. His colleague, Lawrence Lyford, deputy public affairs officer for the Naval Air Engineering Station here, said, &#8220;Rick Zitarosa is our resident expert on the subject of lighter-than-air service. He achieved this standing through extensive document research and numerous interviews.&#8221; Mr. Zitarosa said the ship, the German zeppelin LZ 129, was on its 63rd flight and had logged 3,000 hours of reliable service. &#8220;It was a large, complex machine, three times as long as a Boeing 747,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Its structure consisted of 12 miles of duralumin, an aircraft alloy, girders joined by over 4 million rivets and 100 miles of brace wires. The outer skin was 40 acres of cotton fabric impregnated with iron oxide, cellulose acetate butyrate and aluminum powder.&#8221; He added that the zeppelin&#8217;s 16 cells, made of gas-proof latex-treated cotton, contained seven million cubic feet of hydrogen gas capable of lifting 247,000 pounds. Four Daimler-Benz diesel engines propelled the Hindenburg to a maximum speed of 84 miles an hour. &#8220;A crew of 16 operated the ship and there were cabins inside the hull for 50 passengers,&#8221; he said. On May 6, strong Atlantic headwinds and stormy weather on the East Coast had delayed the Hindenburg&#8217;s arrival by 12 hours. Mr. Zitarosa said that Captain Max Pruss &#8220;may have been in a hurry to get the ship on the ground. During a lull in the thunderstorm activity, he made a rather tight turn during its final approach. Gas was vented to bring the ship into trim. During the last 11 minutes of the trip, the ship was tail heavy, so 2,000 pounds of water was dropped from the stern. &#8220;Electrical conditions in the atmosphere were probably a little risky. Earlier in the day, rubber factories in northern New Jersey had been closed due to static in the air; the fear was that stocks of carbon black might ignite.&#8221; The Hindenburg&#8217;s heavy tail just before landing is evidence of a loss of hydrogen, Mr. Zitarosa said, adding that there were two likely explanations for the leak: a stuck valve during maneuvering to reduce altitude or a minor structural failure caused by guy wires snapping during the aggressive turn, resulting in the puncture of a gas cell. &#8220;U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer R. H. Ward, from his position at the top of the mooring mast, noticed fluttering in the upper-rear area of the Hindenburg&#8217;s skin,&#8221; Mr. Zitarosa said. &#8220;That had to be gas rippling in the space between the frame and the outer covering.&#8221; Another witness saw a likely ignition source. Mr. Zitarosa said a Princeton professor reported seeing a dim blue flame, like St. Elmo&#8217;s fire, the electrical discharge that sometimes occurs during thunderstorms, flickering along the ship&#8217;s backbone girder. The ship burst into flame at about 7:25 p.m. &#8220;In a nutshell, the catastrophe began with escaping hydrogen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Air mixing with the hydrogen created a combustible mixture. Either a spark jumping from the electrically charged outer covering to the metal framework or the St. Elmo&#8217;s fire lit the mixture. A puff or pop indicating detonation was heard by several observers. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to note that the Hindenburg didn&#8217;t explode. It was consumed by rapid combustion; this is evident in photographs. Heat produced in the first burning cell raised the temperature of adjacent cells, causing hydrogen to spill out of pressure-relief valves. It took only 34 seconds for fire to engulf the entire ship.&#8221; Thirty-six people were killed. What about several sabotage theories that have been debated? &#8220;Germany had many enemies in 1937,&#8221; Mr. Zitarosa said. &#8220;After the disaster, there were thorough investigations by a very paranoid Nazi government and its notorious secret police, but no smoking gun was found.&#8221; Theorists have also pointed to hot diesel engines, leaking diesel fuel, and skin allegedly coated with rocket fuel as the cause of the accident. Mr. Zitarosa dismissed that theory, saying that the engines and fuel were in the lower half of the ship, while the fire was observed first in the upper part. Mr. Zitarosa also dismissed the incendiary paint theory proposed by a retired technician, Addison Bain, and an author, R. G. Van Treuren. The Discovery Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Mythbuster&#8221; television show rejected the paint theory after igniting three scale-model Hindenburgs. While the accident destroyed the Hindenburg, it didn&#8217;t harm the base. Seventy years later, Lakehurst is still a Navy facility. Before the Navy came to town, the property was used for World War I chemical warfare experimentation by the Army. In 1919, Navy Secretary converted the site to a Navy dirigible field to be equipped with two rigid airship hangars. Hangar No. 1, still standing, was completed two years later. The Navy commissioned rigid airships for use as long-range aerial scouts and nonrigid ships (called blimps) for training and antisubmarine work. All were filled with helium, not hydrogen. After World War II, training and maintenance continued until 1962. This year, the Navy acquired a commercial blimp that it is testing at Lakehurst. Now called Naval Air Engineering Station, Lakehurst specializes in producing aircraft carrier launch, recovery, and support equipment for planes and helicopters.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 15, 2007 FRED KANTER deserves a lifetime pass to the New York auto show. Skip to next paragraph Those most taken by the 789 can order their own for $135,000. His first trip to the show, in 1958, was the pilgrimage of “a car-struck 13-year-old” from New Jersey, Mr. Kanter recalled in a recent interview. “Shortly after a friend and I arrived by train from Morris Plains, I was transfixed by the Dual-Ghia 400 concept on display,” he said. “It was absolutely breathtaking, very imaginative and the most stunning car I’d ever seen.” The car had been created as a design study by Ghia, the Italian coachbuilder, for Dual Motors, a limited-edition car builder in Detroit. Dual-Ghias gained visibility with celebrity owners like and his Rat Pack pals. Alex Freeman, a New Jersey machine shop owner who had come to the auto show in search of a family car, was also moved by the Dual-Ghia 400. All thoughts of shopping for a new Ford or Chevy were swept aside by Mr. Freeman’s realization that he “must have that car.” Hearing that, his wife shuffled the couple’s eight-year-old daughter to another display, explaining that daddy needed time by himself. By the time Mrs. Freeman returned, her husband had convinced Gene Casaroll, president of Dual Motors, to sell the car on display for $15,000, at least twice the price of a new Cadillac. Delivery was postponed to let the car finish its tour of auto shows. Nearly 20 years later, Mr. Kanter heard that the concept car was for sale. A deal was struck the same day and by that evening, the dream machine was parked in the Kanter garage. Never intending to hide his prize, Mr. Kanter has often displayed the car in the classics section at the New York show. Gregg D. Merksamer, the show’s historian and author of “A History of the New York International Auto Show” (Lionheart Books, 2000) said he thought no other car had topped the Dual-Ghia’s number of appearances at the show. This year Mr. Kanter enjoyed the show — which ends today — from both sides of the velvet ropes, as a spectator and an exhibitor. His own design showcase, a two-seat convertible called the 789 that gathers up Chevrolet’s Greatest Hits of the 1950s, is displayed near the entrance to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. The roadster, painted a brilliant two-tone blue, combines the front end of a ’57 Bel Air, the center of a ’58 Impala and the rear of a ’59. It drew crowds of gawkers, many of whom stopped for snapshots. And those most taken by the 789 are able to order their own — for $135,000, the new owners can have their 789 painted and trimmed to their liking. Mr. Kanter’s car, which can be seen at , is built on the chassis of a sixth-generation Corvette. It is 4 inches wider, 11 inches longer and 150 pounds heavier than a stock Corvette convertible. Building a few dozen 789s a year is merely the tip of Mr. Kanter’s iceberg. His main business is Kanter Auto Products, a source of hard-to-find parts for vintage cars in need of a replacement ball joint or brake drum. Mr. Kanter’s auto entrepreneurship began taking shape at age 15. While helping friends haul home a ’32 Plymouth for a hot-rod project, he spotted a ’37 Packard resting forlornly near a gas station in Branchville, N. J. When the $35 Plymouth deal fell through, the group’s interest shifted to the Packard, which had an asking price of $50. “Between us we had enough money for a deposit,” he said. “It wasn’t running, so we towed it home, fixed the engine and sold the spare parts stashed in its back seat for more than our initial investment.” While visiting dealers for the parts he needed to repair his Packard, Mr. Kanter learned that a hubcap might cost $8 and a door handle $12 but, since Packard had gone out of business, a dealer might have two truck loads of spare parts he would be happy to unload for $100. Every Packard dealer’s junk soon became Mr. Kanter’s gold. In 1960, he bought the parts inventory of a dealer in Henderson, Pa. Like a grapevine, his operations spread along the East Coast, then extended west to Detroit and beyond. While attending Lehigh University, where he earned degrees in industrial engineering and applied sciences, Fred and his brother Dan sold parts to the Packard needy using Fred’s college address. Various storage sites, including their parents’ basement, housed the inventory. Today, Mr. Kanter said, the vintage parts business is a $15 million operation with 65 employees and 150,000 square feet of warehouse space in Boonton, N.J. “We stock everything a Packard dealer would have offered from a clock hand to a new frame,” he said. “And we’re still buying inventory from anyone interested in disposing of their stock.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/13/business/worldbusiness/13toyota.html	Toyota Promotes an American to Its Board - New York Times Toyota Promotes an American to Its Board Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 13, 2007 TOKYO, April 12 — announced a management shuffle on Thursday that would elevate the president of its North American operations, James E. Press, to be the first non-Japanese to sit on the automaker’s board. Skip to next paragraph Fabrizio Costantini for the New York Times Managing Globalization Blog: Labor Finds a Way to Globalize The move comes amid concerns at Toyota over political resentment in the United States, where Japanese carmakers have prospered while the American producers struggle. It also reflects the efforts of Toyota, a solidly Japanese company, to become more international these days, as it produces and sells more vehicles overseas than in Japan. The changes announced on Thursday would increase the number of board members to 30 from 25. Mr. Press, 60, was among nine new directors appointed. Four members retired, including the executive vice president, Yoshimi Inaba, a popular executive who had led Toyota’s important China operations for two years. The changes are subject to approval by a meeting of shareholders in June, the company said. In addition to his new board seat, Mr. Press was promoted to senior managing director, an executive post in the Japanese parent company just two rungs below Toyota’s president, Katsuaki Watanabe. Mr. Press is also the first non-Japanese to advance to this level in Toyota’s 72-year history, the company said. His promotion came after years of discussion at Toyota about whether to name Americans, Europeans and other non-Japanese to its board. In the last few years, sales outside Japan have far outstripped those at home, but the makeup of the board did not reflect that. About four years ago, Toyota created the senior managing director post as a first step toward giving more authority to non-Japanese, short of board seats. Mr. Press is to join a board with 29 other members, most of whom have spent their entire careers at Toyota. He joined Toyota from in 1970, when the Japanese automaker sold just over 200,000 cars in the United States, all imported from Japan. Last year, it was the third-largest seller of autos in the United States, behind Mr. Press rose through the ranks of the company’s North American sales subsidiary, where he was known for close ties with dealers. He took over as president of Toyota’s North American operations last year after his predecessor, a Japanese executive, resigned after being named in a sexual-harassment lawsuit. The suit was settled, and the executive later retired. If any American executive was to be named to the board, the most likely candidate was Mr. Press, senior Toyota executives have said. They characterized him as having the best understanding of any American executive of the company’s corporate culture, which stresses a long-term view, employee involvement, adherence to Toyota’s manufacturing process and continuous improvement. Mr. Press has taken a more visible role in the American operations over the last year. Last month, he testified to Congress alongside executives from Detroit automakers, with legislation under consideration that would raise fuel-economy standards to as much as 40 miles a gallon, from the current 27.5. And in February, he spoke to the Economic Club of Chicago, where he stressed the company’s interest in the environment. Toyota has built market share in the United States with fuel-efficient vehicles like the Camry and Corolla sedans at a time when the American producers have been closing factories and laying off workers. Its success has prompted some Toyota executives to express concern about possible trade problems with Washington. While Toyota has not been singled out, some in Congress criticize Japan, saying it undervalues its currency, the yen, to help drive down the prices of its autos. Four House Democrats recently wrote to Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , saying the yen’s value had increased Japanese auto exports to the United States.

Press, to be the first non-Japanese to sit on the automaker’s board. Skip to next paragraph Fabrizio Costantini for the New York Times Managing Globalization Blog: Labor Finds a Way to Globalize The move comes amid concerns at Toyota over political resentment in the United States, where Japanese carmakers have prospered while the American producers struggle. It also reflects the efforts of Toyota, a solidly Japanese company, to become more international these days, as it produces and sells more vehicles overseas than in Japan. The changes announced on Thursday would increase the number of board members to 30 from 25. Mr. Press, 60, was among nine new directors appointed. Four members retired, including the executive vice president, Yoshimi Inaba, a popular executive who had led Toyota’s important China operations for two years. The changes are subject to approval by a meeting of shareholders in June, the company said. In addition to his new board seat, Mr. Press was promoted to senior managing director, an executive post in the Japanese parent company just two rungs below Toyota’s president, Katsuaki Watanabe. Mr. Press is also the first non-Japanese to advance to this level in Toyota’s 72-year history, the company said. His promotion came after years of discussion at Toyota about whether to name Americans, Europeans and other non-Japanese to its board. In the last few years, sales outside Japan have far outstripped those at home, but the makeup of the board did not reflect that. About four years ago, Toyota created the senior managing director post as a first step toward giving more authority to non-Japanese, short of board seats.

In a preliminary earnings report released a day ahead of its annual shareholder meeting, Volkswagen said it earned 740 million euros (slightly more than $1 billion) in the quarter, compared with 327 million euros a year earlier. Sales rose 5.1 percent, to 26.6 billion euros ($36.1 billion), from 25.3 billion euros. Operating earnings, which analysts use as a yardstick of a company’s health, rose 80 percent, to 1.08 billion euros ($1.5 billion), from 599 million euros. VW has spent nearly two years cutting 20,000 jobs from its German work force as it faces rising European and Asian competition. The company said this week that worldwide vehicle sales rose 7.9 percent in the first quarter, to 1.47 million units. Big gains in China and Eastern Europe, and a modest gain in the United States, helped offset a dip in domestic sales after Germany increased its value-added tax rate in January. VW, based in the northern city of Wolfsburg, said it expected its operating profit for all of 2007 to “probably be higher than the previous year’s operating profit” of two billion euros. In trading here Wednesday, Volkswagen shares closed up 0.6 percent, at 115.22 euros ($156.47). Last month, Porsche raised its stake in Volkswagen to 31 percent, a move it said was aimed at protecting the company from a hostile takeover. Porsche has built up its holding to become VW’s largest shareholder. A German state, Lower Saxony, owns nearly 20 percent.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/automobiles/autoreviews/15BIKE.html	Review - BMW K1200GT - New York Times A BMW to Ride When a Trip Is Long and Time Is Short Upper and lower right, Jerry Garrett for The New York Times Options on the BMW K1200GT include a xenon headlight and a heated seat (handlebar switch at lower right). Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 15, 2007 A TWO-SEAT touring motorcycle without a passenger backrest or top luggage case, it occurs to me, is a vehicle with the everyday practicality of a backless hospital gown. There just seems to be something missing, you know? But if you can find someone daring (or clueless) enough to ride with you on the back of a 2007 BMW K1200GT, a 152-horsepower sport bike adapted to long-distance duty, you’re not likely to even know they are there anyway. Indeed, whack open the throttle with a passenger aboard, as I did recently while entering a freeway, and you might wonder if your companion could possibly hang on for the sprint through the gears. The passenger’s inevitable rearward slide can be avoided, though, by ordering an optional top case (available in large or small). But that is not the way BMW really intended the K1200GT to be equipped. Despite having room for a passenger, the K1200GT is styled and designed to be the ultimate loner’s touring bike. Who besides the operator really wants to tour at triple digits? The superbike-class horsepower of the K1200GT is a relatively new phenomenon at BMW, a departure from the company’s legacy of workhorse opposed-twin engines, which power its R series bikes. The K designation signifies an in-line 4-cylinder engine, which in this case positions the cylinders transversely across the frame, like most Japanese in-line 4s. The engine of the original K bikes, introduced in the mid-1980s, was aligned front to back, with the cylinders canted over horizontally, parallel to the ground. The K1200LT, a comfort-oriented touring model, still uses this layout. BMW’s shift in design philosophy is a result of its intent to establish a presence in the high-performance class long dominated by Japanese makers, whose bikes seem to ratchet up the horsepower each model year. How do the K bikes measure up? Well, the K1200R was named the 2005 Motorcycle of the Year by Motorcyclist, an enthusiast publication; a K1200S went 173 miles an hour to set a class speed record at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah in 2005; and the editors of Cycle World magazine selected the K1200GT as the industry’s top sport-touring bike for 2006. The temptation is to say the K1200GT is all about its engine. Top speed is somewhere north of 150 miles an hour — a speed at which you can run confidently and comfortably (though illegally, in most places) given the right roads. All this motive power is courtesy of a slightly reworked version of the 1,157 cc four also used in the K1200S and K1200R models, both of which put more than 160 horsepower at the rider’s disposal. Though in the K1200GT this powerplant makes just 152 horsepower, it is still enough to be the benchmark of the sport-touring class. As a whole, it seems the K lineup is becoming more like a motorcycling equivalent of BMW’s racing-inspired M cars. Beyond the high-performance aspects, though, there is also a high-tech factor that enhances the appeal of these bikes. The K1200GT was introduced in 2006, then quickly updated. The 2007 model was released with compelling new features like electronic traction control — automatic stability control in BMW’s lexicon — that was an industry first (although it is spreading to other BMW models). The nomenclature is potentially confusing. On automobiles, stability control usually describes a system that can apply the brake at one of the car’s four corners to interrupt a skid and put the vehicle back on the path the driver intended to take. The system on a two-wheel K1200GT obviously cannot do that, but it can help when the rear loses traction. The bike system, a $365 option, reduces engine power through the ignition or fuel injection, enabling the rear wheel to regain traction. The traction control works in conjunction with BMW’s integral antilock brakes, using the same sensors. The sensors determine when the front and rear wheels are moving at different speeds. The system works best compensating for road hazards like wet pavement, slippery white lines and manhole covers, or gravel on the road.

Skip to next paragraph Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger fills up. Comparing Six Hydrogen Vehicles While automakers have demonstrated that they can build vehicles that produce no tailpipe pollutants, the commercial availability of hydrogen to power them remains a showstopper. There are other issues, of course — the cost of fuel cells and the methods of storing hydrogen among them — but matters like driveability and safety are no longer impediments to retail introduction. Still, hydrogen proponents promise a future of placid (and carbon-free) travel punctuated by occasional stops to replenish our tanks as conveniently as we fill them today. They champion an America laced by a hydrogen highway, dotted with service stations that offer safe, affordable refueling. Perhaps clean restrooms will be part of that future, too. Their vision is more than an idealistic pipe dream. President Bush has been talking up hydrogen for four years; the Energy Department has set a goal for hydrogen to provide 10 percent of the nation’s energy needs by 2030; and Samuel W. Bodman, the secretary of energy, recently doled out research grants worth $8.2 million aimed at expanding hydrogen storage capacity. The hydrogen movement actually began long before the recent spurt of activity. General Motors started experiments with hydrogen fuel in the 1960s, followed by BMW in the 1970s. Six years ago, Honda built a solar-powered hydrogen production facility at its Torrance, Calif., research center. Today, every major vehicle maker is studying alternatives to gasoline with the goal of supplanting hydrocarbons with hydrogen. So far, the only hydrogen fueling stations in service are prototypes like Honda’s, built to foster research. Hydrogen tankers are not an everyday sight on American highways, and the hydrogen production plants needed to slake America’s thirst for portable energy have not been built. The hydrogen highway is not yet a county byway, let alone an Interstate. But it is more than a dirt path through the woods. Hydrogen is at least a global commodity: 50 million tons of this industrial gas are produced every year around the world. More than half of that is used to make ammonia, a component of fertilizer, cleaning products and medicines. It is also a constituent of methanol, an important ingredient in paint, antifreeze and formaldehyde. The surprising slice of the global hydrogen pie is the 14 million tons — more than 25 percent of annual production — consumed by oil companies. Hydrogen is a cozy bedfellow with petroleum, both an ingredient in the refining processes used to upgrade the quality of crude oil and a byproduct of the catalytic refining process. It is collected for on-site use, but that source is not enough to meet the needs of refiners. The rising demand for gasoline is pressuring refiners to use lower quality crude oil, which requires more hydrogen. In addition, recent mandates to reduce the sulfur levels of diesel fuel have also increased demand for hydrogen. Hydrogen can be transported from centralized plants by pipeline or tank truck, but a more practical option is manufacturing it on-site by a process known as steam reforming, which separates the hydrogen from natural gas. Steam reforming is a cost-effective means of sustaining the oil business, but not a viable way to energize a hydrogen economy. The available supply of natural gas simply is not adequate to support our growing needs to use it for generating electricity, heating our homes and meeting the hydrogen demands of industry. One downside to steam reforming is the amount of carbon dioxide — the main greenhouse gas — generated when hydrogen is extracted from natural gas this way. Steam reforming, used to produce 95 percent of the hydrogen supply for the United States, according to the Energy Department, releases 350 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. One possible way to offset that undesirable addition to the atmosphere is sequestration, collecting the carbon dioxide and storing it in the ocean or the ground. This plan shows some promise, but not on the scale required to support a hydrogen-powered future.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/automobiles/autoreviews/15BLOCK.html	Review - Suzuki SX4 Wagon - New York Times High Wagon, Now in Half Pints The 2007 Suzuki SX4 wagon. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 15, 2007 Skip to next paragraph The SX4 sedan will be available in the fall. $15,624 base; $16,724 as tested with automatic transmission. A 2-liter in-line 4; four-speed automatic; all-wheel drive. All SX4&#8217;s have six air bags, including head-protection curtains. Antilock brakes and a tire pressure monitor are standard. Traction control and electronic stability control are available only on the SX4 Sport. The government has not crash-tested the SX4. With the automatic gearbox, the rating is 24 miles a gallon in town, 30 on the highway. Honda Fit $14,650; Nissan Versa SL $15,550; Chrysler PT Cruiser $17,620. (All similarly equipped.) AS the new wave of economical hatchbacks ripples through the American auto market, the era of lumbering sport utility vehicles already seems as kitschy as towering tailfins or butterfly-collar disco shirts. The Suzuki SX4 wagon is taking advantage of this shift by straddling a razor-thin line between the baby sport utility and the all-wheel-drive economy car. The SX4 is only 162.8 inches long, half a foot shorter than the four-door Versa and only about five inches longer than the Fit. From the outside, the SX4&#8217;s squat dimensions, tall windows and large side mirrors, which bear some resemblance to Mickey Mouse&#8217;s ears, deliver a welcome dose of cuteness, a trait not usually found in the macho realm of S.U.V.&#8217;s. But the SX4&#8217;s best party trick is its standard all-wheel-drive system. A switch on the center console has three settings: front drive, four-wheel drive (which transfers power between the front and rear axles), or a four-wheel mode that locks the center differential for very slippery situations. So has Suzuki managed to obtain the station wagon equivalent of geek-chic? When you step inside, you realize that the huggable exterior is somewhat muted by a sober cabin. Expanses of gray plastic are brightened (but only a bit) by slivers of metallic-looking plastic on the center console and gearshift knob. The dashboard layout is clear, with easy-to-read gauges and large rotary knobs for the air-conditioner. The base four-speaker AM/FM/CD/MP3 and XM-ready stereo is a cinch to master, if a little tinny-sounding when the volume is cranked up. A nine-speaker stereo, with subwoofer and six-disc, in-dash CD player, is standard on the SX4 Sport. My basic test vehicle came with a four-speed automatic in lieu of the five-speed manual, but it lacked the $300 convenience package that includes cruise control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with integrated audio controls. (I was stuck with a thin, slippery steering wheel instead.) On a more positive note, the smooth-shifting automatic did a fine job in mixed city and highway driving. The SX4&#8217;s steering is solid and agile. But with a curb weight of nearly 3,000 pounds, acceleration is merely adequate with the 143-horsepower 4-cylinder engine. Fuel economy is also just on the right side of O.K., and an 11-gallon tank limits the range to as little as 260 miles between fill-ups. Oddly, the SX4 carries a higher mileage rating with the automatic than with the manual. A ride through Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island proved the comfort of the suspension and cloth seats. With the 60/40 split-folding rear seat lowered, there is a useful 54.3 cubic feet for cargo. The cabin is roomy enough for four average-size adults. Air-conditioning, power windows and power locks are standard, and the six air bags include side curtains. It is too bad, though, that traction and stability controls are available only on the pricier SX4 Sport. The SX4 wagon will be joined this fall by a sedan version, introduced recently at the New York auto show. The SX4 lacks the lofty mileage figures and nimble demeanor of some competitors. Yet as a pint-size wagon with standard all-wheel drive, a roomy interior and a price around $15,000, it has little direct competition at all.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/automobiles/collectibles/22REAL.html	Authentic, or Expert Fake? Due Diligence May Tell - New York Times Authentic, or Expert Fake? Due Diligence May Tell It is an Auto Union D-type, just not the one that won the French Grand Prix. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 EYEBROWS rose in the collector car world early this year when Christie’s announced that an important Grand Prix racecar from the 1930s — with the potential to become the most expensive car ever sold at auction, Christie’s said — would be offered at the Retromobile exhibition in Paris. Presale publicity from the auction house set high expectations, anticipating bids from $12 million to $15 million, which would easily top the $8.7 million price of a Bugatti Royale sold in 1987. Skip to next paragraph Canada Clings to an Old Ford The racecar was a 12-cylinder Auto Union D-type, one of about 20 built by the German car company that included Audi. Initial research indicated it was chassis No. 21, the winner of the 1939 French Grand Prix. But before the February auction took place, Christie’s, working with Audi Tradition, keeper of the automaker’s historic records, determined it was actually chassis No. 19. That car competed in the 1939 race, but rather than winning, it finished sixth with Hans Stuck behind the wheel. Christie’s disclosed the findings and withdrew the car from the sale. A specialist for Christie’s, Christopher Sanger, said, “While we were disappointed to not publicly sell the D-type because of the provenance, we take these issues very seriously; fortunately, we got it right.” That the history of even such a well-researched car could prove wrong points out the challenges facing buyers of vintage cars. While the Auto Union situation did not involve any intent to deceive a buyer, increasing values of collector cars create a temptation for unscrupulous sellers to misrepresent their offerings. That’s where the experts come in. “This has been a problem for years with racecars and many of the classics,” says Deane Fehrman of Golden, Colo., an automobile appraiser and a Fellow of the American Society of Appraisers. “With racecars, it’s tough to tell if what you have is what ran the race,” Mr. Fehrman said, referring to the many changes in equipment that can happen over a racecar’s competitive life. Numbers, if used at all, were mostly just internal ways of keeping inventory, and not identifiers of individual vehicles. As in the world of fine art, the most elaborate attempts to misrepresent cars occur where the profit potential is greatest. That was the case with a Ferrari sold by Lord Brockett, a British collector who got involved in the heady world of Ferrari sales in the 1980s, when rising prices seemed destined to continue. Lord Brockett commissioned a reproduction of a Ferrari 250 SWB, or short wheel base, to be built on the chassis of a far less valuable 250 GTE 2+2, and to hide the fraud the car was given the serial number of a long-missing 250 SWB. The legitimate car later turned up; Lord Brockett ended up in jail for a variety of offenses, including an insurance scheme involving five cars he had cut up and buried on the family estate. He is now a motivational speaker. Such forgeries may be getting harder to conceal. Ferrari has recently instituted a program, Ferrari Certificato di Identificazione, which issues a heritage certificate. Owners can have details of their cars’ originality verified, including factory options and in many cases, the original owner or seller. Other automakers are providing help with finding out if a car is what it purports to be, or at least what it was when it was built. This is particularly useful for American cars of the 1960s and ’70s. The availability of used and reproduction parts makes it relatively easy for an unscrupulous seller to create a clone, or replica, muscle car from a more common model — which is, of course, exactly what automakers did in making a car like the Pontiac GTO from a Tempest. Pontiac Historic Services maintains copies of factory records for many of its early products. It can provide Pontiac owners or prospective buyers with a copy of the factory invoice or billing history for their specific car as well as a letter that translates the factory option codes. For Dodge, Plymouth, Chrysler and De Soto vehicles, the DaimlerChrysler Corporate Historical Collection in Detroit has information on many individual cars built between 1930 and 1967. Build information for models stored on I.B.M. punch cards is available for a fee. Next Article in Automobiles (23 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph Who Needs Car Keys? Around the floor of the New York International Auto Show, which runs through tomorrow, doors swing open to reveal push-button starters — no key necessary. They can be found on about 55 cars and trucks, including luxury models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes, and on Nissan’s inexpensive Versa as part of a $700 “convenience package.” Push-button starters have also become standard on hybrid-electric vehicles, like the Toyota Prius. James D. Farley, the chief of North American marketing at Toyota, said that he has been fretting about whether to build all future models with push-button starters. “What keeps me awake?” he asked recently. “Car keys.” Push-button starters are a retro feature, dating back to the industry’s toddler years. In 1913, the Locomobile became one of the first cars to use one. Carmakers also started using keys around that time, after ignitions (and car theft) were invented. Today’s keyless models use a fob — the small remote control device that most modern cars use to lock and unlock doors — but it performs the additional duty of sending a signal to the ignition. For the car to start, the fob has to be somewhere near the dashboard, perhaps stowed in a cup holder. A driver then just needs to put a foot on the brake, and push the button. The engine comes to life, or, in the case of hybrids, the word “ready” lights up on the dashboard. Turning off the car happens the same way: gearshift in park, foot on the brake, finger on the button. Not everyone is quite ready to give up keys. Honda decided not to offer a push-button starter on its newest MDX model, sold by its Acura luxury division. The cost of installing sensors to operate the ignition, said its chief engineer, Frank Paluch, was more than Honda thought even well-heeled customers would be willing to pay. But that may change as other car companies shift to push-buttons, sending car keys to the same bin now filled with window cranks and whitewall tires.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 IN the Johnny Cash song &#8220;A Boy Named Sue,&#8221; the protagonist is inspired by the revelation that his deadbeat dad gave him that awful name because, &#8220;I knew you&#8217;d have to get tough or die.&#8221; Perhaps that&#8217;s the rationale for saddling the otherwise appealing 2008 Land Rover LR2 with a rather unappealing name. Yes, the LR2&#8217;s stablemate, the LR3, carries an equally mundane designation. But the anonymity that comes with such a cipher of a label has helped the LR3 remain somewhat under the radar as it has compiled one of the auto industry&#8217;s lamest reliability records. Time will tell whether the LR2 transcends its potentially fateful family ties (Swedish engineering, Ford penny-pinching, British &#8220;reliability&#8221;) or is destined like the LR3 to remain a bottom-feeder in J. D. Power&#8217;s quality ratings. At least the LR2 wasn&#8217;t named Freelander, after the model it succeeds. That name, and the troubled model to which it was attached, had even more baggage. In what may have been the final nail in the Freelander&#8217;s coffin, at least in the United States, The Associated Press mistakenly called it the &#8220;Freeloader.&#8221; (Outside North America, the LR2 will be called Freelander 2.) The LR2 is one of those clean-sheet-of-paper designs, which means, a Land Rover engineer assured me, &#8220;It shares not a single part with the outgoing Freelander.&#8221; Doesn&#8217;t that sound like a catchy advertising slogan? The Freeload, er, Freelander arrived in the colonies in 2001; its sales peaked the next year at 15,000 units. Oblivion gradually followed, as with each sale it alienated another customer &#151; not just from the reliability-challenged Freelander, but from the entire Land Rover brand. Likewise, the larger LR3, which replaced the Discovery, was meant to lure back some of the disgruntled former owners that the Discovery&#8217;s quality gremlins had chased away, but its high price (relative to the Discovery) and comparably appalling reliability caused even more defections. Somewhat surprisingly, overall sales for the Land Rover brand are robust, thanks to the top-end Range Rover and Range Rover Sport models so adored by the landed gentry. As the brand&#8217;s latest good-will ambassador, the LR2 looks the part. The upright greenhouse, broad shoulders and fender gills scream Land Rover; the LR2 also retains some Freelander cues, particularly at the front. The LR2 is Land Rover&#8217;s only car-based utility vehicle; it is built on Ford Motor&#8217;s new EUCD platform, a derivative of the C1 platform for midsize automobiles. Volvo has done extensive subsequent engineering on EUCD, the structure that currently underpins the Volvo S80. Contrary to some reports, this platform is not shared by the Ford Escape or Mazda Tribute, although redesigned 2009 Escapes and Tributes will use it. This platform has a lower center of gravity than the old Freelander chassis. But larger wheels and tires cause a tiny overall increase in the LR2&#8217;s tipping point. A wider track, however, offsets the gravity issue. In short, the LR2 feels a lot more firmly planted than the Freelander did. In my testing, the LR2 rode rock solid, and there are reasons for that: a longer wheelbase, a 40 percent improvement in torsional rigidity, a fully independent suspension and quick rack-and-pinion steering (only 2.6 turns lock-to-lock). Land Rover says it tested and tuned the LR2&#8217;s handling at the N&#252;rburgring racetrack in Germany. The steering felt a bit heavy &#151; Land Rover confirmed that this was intentional &#151; but I prefer a little resistance in wheeling around a heavy-duty vehicle. Through high-speed corners, the steering maintained a consistent line, without constant need for driver adjustments. Body lean and sway were remarkably minimal, at least for a Land Rover. Among entry-level luxury S.U.V.&#8217;s, the LR2&#8217;s handling should be competitive, although the BMW X3 remains the class valedictorian.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 IN the Johnny Cash song &#8220;A Boy Named Sue,&#8221; the protagonist is inspired by the revelation that his deadbeat dad gave him that awful name because, &#8220;I knew you&#8217;d have to get tough or die.&#8221; Perhaps that&#8217;s the rationale for saddling the otherwise appealing 2008 Land Rover LR2 with a rather unappealing name. Yes, the LR2&#8217;s stablemate, the LR3, carries an equally mundane designation. But the anonymity that comes with such a cipher of a label has helped the LR3 remain somewhat under the radar as it has compiled one of the auto industry&#8217;s lamest reliability records.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 BMW lit a firecracker at the Shanghai auto show last week, unveiling a design study called the Concept CS that not only signaled an evolution of the company&#8217;s designs, it suggested a possible future sedan that would be bigger and more expensive than any existing model. Skip to next paragraph The Concept CS is wider and lower than BMW&#146;s current flagship sedan, the 7 Series. The Concept CS, which takes its name from highly styled BMWs of the 1960s, is longer, wider and lower than BMW&#8217;s current flagship sedan, the 7 Series. In a telephone interview shortly before he left for China, Christopher E. Bangle, director of design for the BMW Group, said the choice of location for such an important debut reflected the Shanghai show&#8217;s rise to world-class status. Such flattery of the hosts may be smart: Asia is likely to account for a big piece of any future growth in sales of high-end luxury cars. The CS&#8217;s most striking feature is a long, low, flowing roof, which inevitably leads to comparisons with recent &#8220;four-door coupes&#8221; &#151; notably the Mercedes-Benz CLS, Aston Martin Rapide and Porsche Panamera. But the CS, Mr. Bangle insisted, is neither cut nor stretched. &#8220;It was conceived holistically as a four-door saloon,&#8221; he said, using the common European term for a generously proportioned sedan. &#8220;It is not a chopped or stretched anything.&#8221; The CS&#8217;s long hood suggests a powerful engine. The face is aggressive, with a hooded, intent look to the headlights. Large air openings below the front grille seem connected to like-styled apertures for the exhaust in the rear. In between, swollen rocker panels leave the impression that the entire body rides on twin tubes. Other details are more delicate. There is an echo of BMW&#8217;s hallmark roof-pillar shape &#151; called the Hofmeister knick &#151; impressed in the sheet metal. There is a reference to the Z8 in the front lights. The area around the stylized kidney shapes of the grille is delicately modeled; the taillights are stretched and lightened. There&#8217;s a trick side vent that moves when the door opens. The well-known creases of Bangle-era BMWs turn into a play between a long side line and a rear hip line, emphasizing the car&#8217;s considerable length. Over all, aggressiveness plays off delicacy. The car mixes sport signals with luxury signals. Mr. Bangle said the CS grew out of a long study of package and proportions. The car was designed under the direction of Adrian van Hooydonk, who as director of design for the BMW brand sets the hands-on direction for the cars. The lead exterior designer was Karim-Antoine Habib, and the interior was done by Nadya Arnaout. Mr. Bangle acknowledged that the overall shape had a romantic or sensual quality. But &#8220;it&#8217;s not going to win a teddy bear contest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It retains enough hard lines while also conveying some sensuality and sex appeal. Aggressiveness should not be the only way to convey power.&#8221; Next Article in Automobiles (25 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Say I.P., for instrument panel, as designers do. Skip to next paragraph Dropping in a mention of the greenhouse or the beltline is pretty easy, but you will really get points with casual references to A-, B-, and C-pillars, the order of the roof supports arranged from the windshield, whose base is called the cowl, to the rear window, or backlight. You might say, “That fat C-pillar would make it impossible to parallel park.” Every profession has its lingo. A list of common terms — and a few of the most colorful ones — can come in handy. With cars, words and metal share territory: each brand’s vocabulary of shapes is collectively known as its design language. The beltline divides the greenhouse, or glassed-in upper body, from the portion that extends down from the window sills. Equally important is the A-line, said Michael Castiglione, principal exterior designer at DaimlerChrysler’s Pacifica studio in Carlsbad, Calif. The A-line runs the length of the body from headlight to taillight, tracing the car’s silhouette. The car may also have a character line, a crease formed in the sheet metal of the sides. Vehicles are said to have styling cues that prompt viewers to recognize models by their resemblance to other family members — a brand’s characteristic shapes and flourishes, the form of its grille or the arc of the roofline. Cumulatively, they make up the D.R.G., or down-the-road graphic of a car, the visual signature of a quickly glimpsed vehicle that should make it recognizable as a Cadillac or a Ford. At the extreme, think . D.R.G. is not to be confused with D.L.O., for daylight opening, the total area of the window glass. The angle of the windshield is known as its rake — an extreme tilt is said to be fast — while the inward angle of the side greenhouse windows is called the tumblehome. The body section below the base of the door, or rocker panel, is treated with a varying degree of turn-under, which Chris Chapman of BMW’s Designworks studio in Newbury Park, Calif., defines as the shape of the panel as it curves inward at the lower edge. The front face of a car is visually grounded in the lower fascia or valance, typically made of plastic these days. Stance is critical to the character a car projects, and its aggressiveness is frequently noted by designers in their presentations at new-model unveilings. The term refers to the way the body sits on the wheels, with energy — or not. Robert Boniface, director of advanced design for General Motors, recently worked on the Chevrolet Volt and Camaro show cars. He said that “stance has to do with the relative visual stability or instability of a particular design.” Cars with good stance are often referred to as being planted; small wheels and a wide upper body give a car a poor stance. Being planted lends a sense of sure-footedness to the design. Too high a stance can suggest standing on tiptoe, a tentative look. One critical element, designers said, is the axle-to-dash ratio, the proportion between the front wheel and the cowl (which is the base of the windshield). It helps to define the visual personality of the car. Another important relationship, according to Bryan Thompson, a car designer at the Nissan Design America studio in La Jolla, Calif., is that between glass and body. “A vehicle whose body is relatively thick compared to the amount of glass is called chunky,” he said. The proportion between wheel and body sizes is important in lending a vehicle its visual personality. “Wheel-to-body is the relationship of the wheel-tire plane to the sheet metal wheel opening,” Mr. Thompson said. “Wheels that are flush to the body are desirable. Wheels that are well inboard of the sheet metal plane are buried. Vehicles with buried wheels are called overbodied.” At its extreme, an overbodied car has the look of a parade float, with the body visually overpowering the wheels, Mr. Thompson said. The distinctive “bathtub” Nashes of the early 1950s suffered this trait. There is also what is called the roller skate effect, where the wheels and tires are too small for the body. (Volkswagens of the 1980s seemed to have especially small wheels proportionally, and fell prey to this phenomenon.) Huge wheels of 20, 22 or 23 inches, by contrast, make a vehicle look tough.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 29, 2007 AT the moment, hydrogen seems to be the most practical way to power vehicles that do not emit carbon dioxide, the principal greenhouse gas. But despite considerable research, many hurdles remain. Here are some questions and answers: Skip to next paragraph From Point A to Point B by Way of H Comparing Six Hydrogen Vehicles Where does hydrogen come from? Hydrogen, an odorless, colorless gas, is the lightest and most plentiful element in the universe. It is found in water and in most organic matter, but it is usually bound with other elements. For that reason, it is called an energy carrier, meaning that energy has to be expended to extract it. But can’t it be burned in an engine? Fuels like coal, natural gas or oil can be taken from the ground and used with relatively little energy-intensive processing. But hydrogen must be turned into a fuel — and because it takes so much energy to produce, it should not be thought of as a direct replacement for fuels like gasoline. Rather, it is energy in a portable form, somewhat akin to electricity. Because aside from being plentiful, it is very clean. Cars running on hydrogen produce very little tailpipe pollution and no greenhouse gases — they leave only a trail of water. In this way, cars running on fuel cells — which produce electricity by a chemical reaction of hydrogen and oxygen — would produce no tailpipe emissions. What is hydrogen used for today? It has several uses. About nine million tons of hydrogen are produced annually in the United States, mostly for chemical production, petroleum refining and metal treatment. What is the cost of a unit of hydrogen with the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline? That question has many answers. Hydrogen is certainly expensive to produce now, with costs somewhat dependent on the source material. A kilogram of hydrogen has about the same energy content as a gallon of gasoline, but hydrogen proponents point out that fuel cells can have double or triple the efficiency of gasoline engines. Hydrogen is most commonly produced by a process called steam reforming, which extracts the hydrogen from natural gas. The cost of natural gas reforming, which has been the cheapest method, has been affected by the rising price of natural gas. A kilo of hydrogen produced by steam reforming costs from $4 to $8 today. It can also be made by electrolysis, which separates water into hydrogen and oxygen. The cost of hydrogen produced from water is tied to the price of electricity, which fluctuates by region and by type of generation. If grid electricity sold for 5 cents per kilowatt-hour, hydrogen could be produced through electrolysis for $3 per gallon equivalent. But electricity is typically 10 to 14 cents today, so electrolytic hydrogen from grid electricity is often $6 per gallon equivalent or more. These high costs make hydrogen generated from renewable electricity sources like wind farms or solar power more attractive. A federal National Renewable Energy Laboratory report in February estimated that a kilogram of hydrogen could be produced for $3.63 using solar power and for $3.10 using wind. “The solar technology is promising, but it won’t happen quickly,” said Robert D. McConnell of the laboratory’s solar energy program. Can nuclear power be a source of inexpensive hydrogen? Yes. Dr. Kenneth R. Schultz, operations director of the energy group at General Atomics, a research and development firm in San Diego, said that by 2025 the nuclear industry could be able to produce hydrogen for $1.50 to $2 a kilogram. But Amory B. Lovins, chairman and chief scientist at the Rocky Mountain Institute, a nonprofit energy research organization in Snowmass, Colo., described both the process and the price as “aspirational.” How will we use hydrogen in a motor vehicle? There are several options. In the most common prediction, compressed hydrogen gas is stored in a reinforced tank aboard a car, then fed to a fuel cell. The cell is not an engine, but a small chemical factory that converts the pressurized gas to electricity, which runs an electric motor. The only emission is water. Liquid hydrogen offers excellent energy density per volume, but it would have to be carried in cryogenic tanks because hydrogen doesn’t liquefy until it reaches minus 423 degrees Fahrenheit. Metal hydrides offer an opportunity to store hydrogen in solid form, but such a system is heavy and therefore reduces the vehicle’s travel range.

The Sales Pitch, Minus Salesmen The Cal Worthington Collection Appearing with animals was a staple of Mr. Worthington's ads. HI, folks, Cal Worthington here,&#8221; said the voice from the television set. It was 1950; our family had just become the first on the block to buy a television set. When we turned it on, one of the first faces that popped up on its little round screen was a tall, skinny cowboy in a white hat selling used cars. In the background, singers chanted: &#8220;Go see Cal, go see Cal, go see Cal.&#8221; Fifty-seven years later, that same cowboy &#151; still wearing a Stetson &#151; is still on television here, still selling cars. Who is this guy? Dorian Gray? &#8220;I&#8217;m 86 now,&#8221; said Calvin Coolidge Worthington, in a down-home drawl, during a telephone conversation from his 24,000-acre ranch in Orland, Calif., about 100 miles north of Sacramento. &#8220;Born in November 1920 in Oklahoma, seventh of nine kids in my family. I&#8217;ve actually been selling cars since 1945.&#8221; In the meantime, Mr. Worthington has been married three times and had six children: the oldest is 60, the youngest is 6. Cal Worthington has also become a legend in auto dealerships, selling cars throughout the American West from Texas to Alaska. By his count, he&#8217;s sold more than a million cars &#151; nearly every make and model ever made &#151; and grossed billions of dollars. Every fair-size city in America has probably had its own version of the fast-talking used-car salesman, usually distinguished by a 14-carat smile, a loud sport coat and a bad comb-over. Southern California had a bumper crop of these flamboyant television pitchmen in the 1950s, including halo-wearing &#8220;Honest John&#8221; and &#8220;Wild Hog Tony,&#8221; two characters portrayed by Tony Holzer, and Earl Muntz . With his good looks, folksy charm and his dog, Spot &#151; who never looked much like a dog &#151; Mr. Worthington always seemed a cut above that crowd, though he was an integral part of it. It was those TV ads that made Mr. Worthington a cultural icon. The ads made him a minor Hollywood celebrity and led the Television Bureau of Advertising to cite him as &#8220;probably the best-known car dealer pitchman in television history.&#8221; Mr. Worthington recalled pioneers like Muntz. &#8220;Those guys are all dead now. You know, I actually bought my first dealership from Madman Muntz!&#8221; Despite Detroit&#8217;s uphill battle for sales, Mr. Worthington says he&#8217;s partial to American cars. &#8220;Guess I&#8217;m a redneck at heart,&#8221; he said with a chuckle. &#8220;Color me red, white and blue.&#8221; But he&#8217;s not sentimental; he knows how to make a buck. &#8220;Most dealers make about 1.6 percent on every car they sell; I make about 2.4 percent because I&#8217;ve learned to do it more efficiently,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That may not sound like much until you multiply it by a million cars.&#8221; It has been enough to buy him dozens of dealerships, an office building, three shopping centers and eight huge ranches. He also operates his own advertising agency, television studio and finance company. &#8220;I&#8217;ve scaled back a bit on the dealerships; I own just four now,&#8221; Mr. Worthington explained. He and I had agreed that the next time he flew his Learjet 35 into town we would meet at his Ford dealership here, where the walls are a gallery of photos from more than a half-century of his famous television ads. Mr. Worthington showed up the very next week and greeted me with a firm handshake and a steady gaze from steel-blue eyes. He&#8217;s still Marlboro Man handsome, about 6-foot-4, lean as the day he left the Army Air Force in 1945, and he still has a full head of hair &#151; little of it gray &#151; under that ever-present Stetson. Mr. Worthington came to Southern California in 1948 after a much-decorated military career piloting B-17 Flying Fortresses on 29 combat missions over Germany. He made enough selling used cars to start trading in war surplus. That&#8217;s what brought him to California, where it took him nearly two years to sell a ship full of corroded welding equipment he&#8217;d bought. He cleared $13,000, which was enough to buy a Muntz dealership. Next Article in Automobiles (38 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 BMW lit a firecracker at the Shanghai auto show last week, unveiling a design study called the Concept CS that not only signaled an evolution of the company&#8217;s designs, it suggested a possible future sedan that would be bigger and more expensive than any existing model. Skip to next paragraph The Concept CS is wider and lower than BMW&#146;s current flagship sedan, the 7 Series. The Concept CS, which takes its name from highly styled BMWs of the 1960s, is longer, wider and lower than BMW&#8217;s current flagship sedan, the 7 Series. In a telephone interview shortly before he left for China, Christopher E. Bangle, director of design for the BMW Group, said the choice of location for such an important debut reflected the Shanghai show&#8217;s rise to world-class status. Such flattery of the hosts may be smart: Asia is likely to account for a big piece of any future growth in sales of high-end luxury cars. The CS&#8217;s most striking feature is a long, low, flowing roof, which inevitably leads to comparisons with recent &#8220;four-door coupes&#8221; &#151; notably the Mercedes-Benz CLS, Aston Martin Rapide and Porsche Panamera. But the CS, Mr. Bangle insisted, is neither cut nor stretched. &#8220;It was conceived holistically as a four-door saloon,&#8221; he said, using the common European term for a generously proportioned sedan. &#8220;It is not a chopped or stretched anything.&#8221; The CS&#8217;s long hood suggests a powerful engine. The face is aggressive, with a hooded, intent look to the headlights. Large air openings below the front grille seem connected to like-styled apertures for the exhaust in the rear. In between, swollen rocker panels leave the impression that the entire body rides on twin tubes. Other details are more delicate. There is an echo of BMW&#8217;s hallmark roof-pillar shape &#151; called the Hofmeister knick &#151; impressed in the sheet metal. There is a reference to the Z8 in the front lights. The area around the stylized kidney shapes of the grille is delicately modeled; the taillights are stretched and lightened. There&#8217;s a trick side vent that moves when the door opens. The well-known creases of Bangle-era BMWs turn into a play between a long side line and a rear hip line, emphasizing the car&#8217;s considerable length. Over all, aggressiveness plays off delicacy. The car mixes sport signals with luxury signals. Mr. Bangle said the CS grew out of a long study of package and proportions. The car was designed under the direction of Adrian van Hooydonk, who as director of design for the BMW brand sets the hands-on direction for the cars. The lead exterior designer was Karim-Antoine Habib, and the interior was done by Nadya Arnaout. Mr. Bangle acknowledged that the overall shape had a romantic or sensual quality. But &#8220;it&#8217;s not going to win a teddy bear contest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It retains enough hard lines while also conveying some sensuality and sex appeal. Aggressiveness should not be the only way to convey power.&#8221; Next Article in Automobiles (25 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

In between, swollen rocker panels leave the impression that the entire body rides on twin tubes. Other details are more delicate. There is an echo of BMW&#8217;s hallmark roof-pillar shape &#151; called the Hofmeister knick &#151; impressed in the sheet metal. There is a reference to the Z8 in the front lights. The area around the stylized kidney shapes of the grille is delicately modeled; the taillights are stretched and lightened. There&#8217;s a trick side vent that moves when the door opens. The well-known creases of Bangle-era BMWs turn into a play between a long side line and a rear hip line, emphasizing the car&#8217;s considerable length. Over all, aggressiveness plays off delicacy. The car mixes sport signals with luxury signals. Mr. Bangle said the CS grew out of a long study of package and proportions. The car was designed under the direction of Adrian van Hooydonk, who as director of design for the BMW brand sets the hands-on direction for the cars. The lead exterior designer was Karim-Antoine Habib, and the interior was done by Nadya Arnaout. Mr. Bangle acknowledged that the overall shape had a romantic or sensual quality. But &#8220;it&#8217;s not going to win a teddy bear contest,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It retains enough hard lines while also conveying some sensuality and sex appeal. Aggressiveness should not be the only way to convey power.&#8221; Next Article in Automobiles (25 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 8, 2007 LOOKING for America’s next top model? If you’re interested in something more substantial than underfed young women preening on television for a modeling contract, you’ll find plenty of candidates at the New York International Auto Show. Skip to next paragraph 2007 New York Auto Show: Must-See Cars Hip-hop impressario Funkmaster Flex with the Ford Expedition Funkmaster Flex Edition at the New York International Auto Show. From now through next Sunday, the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center plays host to some beauties that show off their nicely proportioned wheels, bodacious bumpers and glittering grilles. As in any beauty pageant, contestants will be judged on their personality, poise, performance and sex appeal. Think of New York as the final elimination round in a series of competitions over the last four months at auto shows in Los Angeles, Detroit, Chicago and Geneva. The winners here advance to the true test: the showroom floors of America’s car dealerships. New York also provides a curtain call for popular performers from earlier shows, like the headline-grabbing (but so far nonfunctional) Chevrolet Volt hybrid electric car, which made its debut in January in Detroit. Sadly, another electrifying concept car, the retro Holden Efijy from Australia, a crowd favorite wherever it has gone, will not be displayed in New York. Also missing from a show attended by lots of high rollers will be the $1.4 million Bugatti Veyron 16.4. And, in perhaps the oddest omission in a city where drivers truly do think small, the tiny Smart cars that go on sale in the United States early next year skipped this show. Still, there are plenty of cars that deserve the attention of New Yorkers attending the show. Here are a dozen highlights: Hmmm. Ford hires Boeing guy as president. Ford announces new vehicle with seating for six. But relax: it’s not six across, with two middle seats and a center aisle for a drink cart. The 2008 Flex is a six-passenger people mover (a seventh seating position is available) based not on the Boeing 737, but on the Ford Fairlane concept car of 2005. This classy-looking crossover wagon is clearly a knock-off of vintage models from Ford’s Land Rover division. When Ford first showed the Fairlane at the 2005 Detroit auto show, the question was asked, “Will Ford build it?” My reply was, “Over Land Rover’s dead body.” That, it seems, was not a consideration. 2. FUNKMASTER FLEX FORD EXPEDITION Please don’t confuse this funked-out S.U.V. with the unfunky Flex crossover. The hip-hop impresario Funkmaster Flex actually introduced a nearly identical version of the Halloween-hued Flexmobile last November in Las Vegas, at the huge Specialty Equipment Market Association trade show for the aftermarket customizing industry. Flex’s Expedition is one of three customized limited editions that Ford is showing in New York. The two others are an F-150 pickup reimagined by the customizer Chip Foose and a 540-horsepower King of the Road Mustang, the Shelby GT500KR, finished by the racecar legend Carroll Shelby. 3. GMC YUKON HYBRID What’s new in environmentally friendly green machines at the auto show? Shockingly little, though General Motors is showing some new hydrids including the 2008 Yukon. This is G.M.’s first full-size S.U.V. hybrid, and it features a two-mode system developed in conjunction with DaimlerChrysler and BMW that results in a mild increase in mileage. The two-mode Yukon hybrid goes on sale late this year. The most intriguing electric car at the show may be one in the display of LeMay collection classics in a far corner downstairs. Look for the 1912 Standard Electric, a fully functional battery-powered runabout that would put many of today’s electric car concepts to shame. Hybrid hunters may be more successful outside the convention hall. This curbside exhibit, organized by the Design Trust for Public Space, demonstrates what the future may hold for the city’s bumblebee-colored taxi fleets. Taxi 07 is not a static display; the vehicles actually work, and in some cases make runs through Midtown. The exhibit features electric cars, gasoline-electric hybrids and taxis with special features for riders with limited mobility. And be sure to savor this bit of fantasy: the exhibit and the taxis are waiting daily, fair weather or foul — unlike cabs on the real streets of New York. Neither you nor your chauffeur may ever drive a 2008 Brooklands coupé (say COO-pay), but you can drool over it here.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/automobiles/22SHOW.html	What Should a Chinese Car Look Like? - New York Times What Should a Chinese Car Look Like? Ariana Lindquist for The New York Times New Ford Mondeo for China emerges in Shanghai. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 Skip to next paragraph THE main language spoken at the Shanghai auto show is Chinese, but the vocabulary of the designs is polyglot: Italian flourishes, high Japanese roofs, German solidity, American assertiveness. What is missing? Almost anything that could indicate the emergence of a distinctly Chinese school of automotive design. China has the world&#8217;s fastest-growing auto market and has already overtaken Japan in domestic sales; it now trails only the United States. Both multinational and Chinese automakers have learned that it is a lot easier to build new car factories than to instill a new generation of Chinese designers and engineers with the sensibilities to have a lasting effect on global automotive design. Chinese automakers like Chery, Great Wall, Landwind and others rely on Italian design studios to come up with concept cars that lend pizazz to their increasingly elaborate auto show displays. Production models remain similar to existing Western and Japanese models &#151; sometimes suspiciously so, like the Chery QQ, a best seller here, which is similar to the Chevrolet Spark. Such limitations are not stopping automakers from trying to determine what buyers in China really want. And with money and talent pouring into the industry, practically everyone here agrees that it is only a matter of time before China starts to become known for car design as well. &#8220;Each country has their own vocabulary or tastes for design, and especially in China they have a very long history&#8221; to develop such tastes, said Katsumi Nakamura, president and chief executive of the Dongfeng Motor Company, a joint venture of Nissan and the Dongfeng Group. With first-time car owners accounting for three-fifths of car buyers, the emphasis so far has been on showiness and providing lots of features that dealership employees can easily explain to customers. &#8220;The current perception of Chinese customers is: luxury means putting on wooden panels, the seat of the car should be leather, and a luxury car should have a sunroof,&#8221; Mr. Nakamura said. The emphasis on flash and interiors has frustrated designers who want to foster a greater appreciation in China for the subtleties of exterior design. &#8220;We have to teach the Chinese a more functional Italian way to use a car &#151; not just for status,&#8221; said Roberto Piatti, chief executive of Torino Design in Italy, which created the Lui sport utility concept vehicle and Lei concept coupe for Chery for the Beijing auto show in November. Sometimes, Chinese designs are surprising. The Great Wall Coolbear concept vehicle, first shown in Beijing, was created by Chinese designers who flew to European and American design institutes for help and then ended up producing a high-roof vehicle reminiscent of the Scion xB. At least one Chinese company has started showing a knack for savvy marketing, although its vehicle designs remain derivative. The classiest displays at the Beijing and Shanghai auto shows belonged not to a luxury brand like Mercedes or Cadillac, but to the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, known as S.A.I.C. The automaker displays its British-influenced sedans on a large polished wooden stand akin to those used by Jaguar at the Detroit auto show. Last year, S.A.I.C. acquired technological rights to the Rover 75 from the MG Rover Group, which is now defunct, while Nanjing Auto bought the rest of the company, including the fabled MG brand. Ford acquired rights to the Rover car brand to retain control over its Land Rover division, so S.A.I.C. has renamed its model the Roewe, which is also easier to pronounce in Chinese. Rover was a decidedly middle-market brand, at best, before it went bust in Britain. But Roewe is being presented here as an up-market line. To make sure no one missed its European heritage in status-conscious China, the S.A.I.C. cars have unusually large badges displaying two regal lions. At the Beijing show, an enormous television screen showed a video again and again of Rovers being driven around country estates &#151; although some of the estates looked more Mediterranean than British. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud of the fact our I.P.R. has British heritage,&#8221; Phil Murtaugh, S.A.I.C.&#8217;s executive vice president said, using an abbreviation for intellectual property rights.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 8, 2007 DETROIT, May 7 — Senator of Illinois delivered a stern message to Detroit auto companies on Monday, saying they had done little to lessen the nation’s dependence on foreign oil and needed to improve the fuel efficiency of their vehicles. Skip to next paragraph The latest political news from around the nation. Sounding at times like a teacher scolding a lazy but promising student, Mr. Obama at the same time proposed incentives to help General Motors, Ford and Chrysler out of a lingering slump that has resulted in dozens of plant closings and the elimination of tens of thousands of jobs this decade. Appearing before a luncheon held by the Detroit Economic Club, Mr. Obama, a Democratic presidential candidate, received a standing ovation when he was introduced by Mayor Kwame M. Kilpatrick, and again at the close of his remarks, which were broadcast live by local television stations. Mr. Obama, making his first campaign visit to Michigan, said he wanted to be blunt with Detroit auto companies on their home turf. Chief executives of the auto companies were not in attendance. “I’m making this proposal here today because I don’t believe in making proposals in California and giving a different speech in Michigan,” he said. His goal “is not to destroy the industry, but to help bring it into the 21st century,” he said. Under Mr. Obama’s plan, which he said would save 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, he proposed a 4 percent a year increase in fuel economy standards beginning in 2009, or the equivalent of about one mile per gallon per year. By 2022, the fuel economy standard for both cars and light trucks would be 40 miles per gallon, according to the plan. The Bush administration has proposed a similar method to raise the fuel economy standard over the next few years. The current federal standards are 27.5 miles per gallon for cars and 24 miles per gallon for light trucks. While the American standard for cars has not increased in the last 20 years, both China and Japan have higher standards, Mr. Obama said. He maintained that cars in Japan typically achieved the equivalent of 45 miles per gallon. In fact, the average fuel economy in 2006 for cars sold by all manufacturers in the United States was slightly more than 30 miles per gallon, higher than the federal standard requires. But automakers’ overall fuel economy was 24.2 miles per gallon, because light trucks, including S.U.V.’s, pickups and minivans, account for slightly more than half the vehicles sold in the United States. The discussion over the standards accelerated last month, when the Supreme Court ruled that the had the ability to regulate carbon dioxide emissions. The primary way to do so, experts say, is by raising fuel efficiency. Mr. Obama also proposed that fuel efficiency standards for cars be rewritten so that mileage requirements are set according to vehicle size, rather than one sweeping standard for all sizes of cars. The current method benefits Japanese auto companies, whose lineups are not as varied as their Detroit rivals, said Mr. Obama, whose state is home to a Ford assembly plant, as well as one owned by the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration took a similar step this decade in recalculating the fuel economy standard for light trucks. Detroit auto companies have backed that as an option for recalculating fuel economy standards for cars. As a carrot to the industry, Mr. Obama would provide up to $3 billion to Detroit auto companies and their suppliers to retool factories to produce more fuel-efficient vehicles. If the companies invest in these vehicles, Mr. Obama also would offer the Detroit companies assistance in dealing with their burden of paying for current and retired workers’ health care expenses, estimated at $1,500 per vehicle. But a spokesman for G.M., Greg Martin, said the automaker preferred to see a broader approach to soaring health care costs. “Health care is an issue that should be a national priority and not an issue unique to G.M.,” Mr. Martin said. Despite Mr. Obama’s sometimes harsh words Monday, the diverse audience interrupted him 10 times for applause. “I think it took a lot of courage to come to Detroit and lay it on the line,” said Peter Eckstein, a retired labor union economist from Ann Arbor, Mich. Leonard Mungo, a Detroit lawyer, said he was surprised to hear specific proposals for addressing the industry’s problems. “He’s saying, ‘You got yourselves into this mess, but now this is how we get out,’ ” Mr. Mungo said.

Ariana Lindquist for The New York Times New Ford Mondeo for China emerges in Shanghai. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 22, 2007 Skip to next paragraph THE main language spoken at the Shanghai auto show is Chinese, but the vocabulary of the designs is polyglot: Italian flourishes, high Japanese roofs, German solidity, American assertiveness. What is missing? Almost anything that could indicate the emergence of a distinctly Chinese school of automotive design. China has the world&#8217;s fastest-growing auto market and has already overtaken Japan in domestic sales; it now trails only the United States. Both multinational and Chinese automakers have learned that it is a lot easier to build new car factories than to instill a new generation of Chinese designers and engineers with the sensibilities to have a lasting effect on global automotive design. Chinese automakers like Chery, Great Wall, Landwind and others rely on Italian design studios to come up with concept cars that lend pizazz to their increasingly elaborate auto show displays. Production models remain similar to existing Western and Japanese models &#151; sometimes suspiciously so, like the Chery QQ, a best seller here, which is similar to the Chevrolet Spark. Such limitations are not stopping automakers from trying to determine what buyers in China really want. And with money and talent pouring into the industry, practically everyone here agrees that it is only a matter of time before China starts to become known for car design as well. &#8220;Each country has their own vocabulary or tastes for design, and especially in China they have a very long history&#8221; to develop such tastes, said Katsumi Nakamura, president and chief executive of the Dongfeng Motor Company, a joint venture of Nissan and the Dongfeng Group. With first-time car owners accounting for three-fifths of car buyers, the emphasis so far has been on showiness and providing lots of features that dealership employees can easily explain to customers. &#8220;The current perception of Chinese customers is: luxury means putting on wooden panels, the seat of the car should be leather, and a luxury car should have a sunroof,&#8221; Mr. Nakamura said. The emphasis on flash and interiors has frustrated designers who want to foster a greater appreciation in China for the subtleties of exterior design. &#8220;We have to teach the Chinese a more functional Italian way to use a car &#151; not just for status,&#8221; said Roberto Piatti, chief executive of Torino Design in Italy, which created the Lui sport utility concept vehicle and Lei concept coupe for Chery for the Beijing auto show in November. Sometimes, Chinese designs are surprising. The Great Wall Coolbear concept vehicle, first shown in Beijing, was created by Chinese designers who flew to European and American design institutes for help and then ended up producing a high-roof vehicle reminiscent of the Scion xB. At least one Chinese company has started showing a knack for savvy marketing, although its vehicle designs remain derivative. The classiest displays at the Beijing and Shanghai auto shows belonged not to a luxury brand like Mercedes or Cadillac, but to the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, known as S.A.I.C. The automaker displays its British-influenced sedans on a large polished wooden stand akin to those used by Jaguar at the Detroit auto show. Last year, S.A.I.C. acquired technological rights to the Rover 75 from the MG Rover Group, which is now defunct, while Nanjing Auto bought the rest of the company, including the fabled MG brand. Ford acquired rights to the Rover car brand to retain control over its Land Rover division, so S.A.I.C. has renamed its model the Roewe, which is also easier to pronounce in Chinese. Rover was a decidedly middle-market brand, at best, before it went bust in Britain. But Roewe is being presented here as an up-market line. To make sure no one missed its European heritage in status-conscious China, the S.A.I.C. cars have unusually large badges displaying two regal lions. At the Beijing show, an enormous television screen showed a video again and again of Rovers being driven around country estates &#151; although some of the estates looked more Mediterranean than British. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud of the fact our I.P.R. has British heritage,&#8221; Phil Murtaugh, S.A.I.C.&#8217;s executive vice president said, using an abbreviation for intellectual property rights.

The emphasis on flash and interiors has frustrated designers who want to foster a greater appreciation in China for the subtleties of exterior design. &#8220;We have to teach the Chinese a more functional Italian way to use a car &#151; not just for status,&#8221; said Roberto Piatti, chief executive of Torino Design in Italy, which created the Lui sport utility concept vehicle and Lei concept coupe for Chery for the Beijing auto show in November. Sometimes, Chinese designs are surprising. The Great Wall Coolbear concept vehicle, first shown in Beijing, was created by Chinese designers who flew to European and American design institutes for help and then ended up producing a high-roof vehicle reminiscent of the Scion xB. At least one Chinese company has started showing a knack for savvy marketing, although its vehicle designs remain derivative. The classiest displays at the Beijing and Shanghai auto shows belonged not to a luxury brand like Mercedes or Cadillac, but to the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, known as S.A.I.C. The automaker displays its British-influenced sedans on a large polished wooden stand akin to those used by Jaguar at the Detroit auto show. Last year, S.A.I.C. acquired technological rights to the Rover 75 from the MG Rover Group, which is now defunct, while Nanjing Auto bought the rest of the company, including the fabled MG brand. Ford acquired rights to the Rover car brand to retain control over its Land Rover division, so S.A.I.C. has renamed its model the Roewe, which is also easier to pronounce in Chinese. Rover was a decidedly middle-market brand, at best, before it went bust in Britain. But Roewe is being presented here as an up-market line. To make sure no one missed its European heritage in status-conscious China, the S.A.I.C. cars have unusually large badges displaying two regal lions. At the Beijing show, an enormous television screen showed a video again and again of Rovers being driven around country estates &#151; although some of the estates looked more Mediterranean than British. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud of the fact our I.P.R. has British heritage,&#8221; Phil Murtaugh, S.A.I.C.&#8217;s executive vice president said, using an abbreviation for intellectual property rights.

Skip to next paragraph Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger fills up. Comparing Six Hydrogen Vehicles While automakers have demonstrated that they can build vehicles that produce no tailpipe pollutants, the commercial availability of hydrogen to power them remains a showstopper. There are other issues, of course — the cost of fuel cells and the methods of storing hydrogen among them — but matters like driveability and safety are no longer impediments to retail introduction. Still, hydrogen proponents promise a future of placid (and carbon-free) travel punctuated by occasional stops to replenish our tanks as conveniently as we fill them today. They champion an America laced by a hydrogen highway, dotted with service stations that offer safe, affordable refueling. Perhaps clean restrooms will be part of that future, too. Their vision is more than an idealistic pipe dream. President Bush has been talking up hydrogen for four years; the Energy Department has set a goal for hydrogen to provide 10 percent of the nation’s energy needs by 2030; and Samuel W. Bodman, the secretary of energy, recently doled out research grants worth $8.2 million aimed at expanding hydrogen storage capacity. The hydrogen movement actually began long before the recent spurt of activity. General Motors started experiments with hydrogen fuel in the 1960s, followed by BMW in the 1970s. Six years ago, Honda built a solar-powered hydrogen production facility at its Torrance, Calif., research center. Today, every major vehicle maker is studying alternatives to gasoline with the goal of supplanting hydrocarbons with hydrogen. So far, the only hydrogen fueling stations in service are prototypes like Honda’s, built to foster research. Hydrogen tankers are not an everyday sight on American highways, and the hydrogen production plants needed to slake America’s thirst for portable energy have not been built. The hydrogen highway is not yet a county byway, let alone an Interstate. But it is more than a dirt path through the woods. Hydrogen is at least a global commodity: 50 million tons of this industrial gas are produced every year around the world. More than half of that is used to make ammonia, a component of fertilizer, cleaning products and medicines. It is also a constituent of methanol, an important ingredient in paint, antifreeze and formaldehyde. The surprising slice of the global hydrogen pie is the 14 million tons — more than 25 percent of annual production — consumed by oil companies. Hydrogen is a cozy bedfellow with petroleum, both an ingredient in the refining processes used to upgrade the quality of crude oil and a byproduct of the catalytic refining process. It is collected for on-site use, but that source is not enough to meet the needs of refiners. The rising demand for gasoline is pressuring refiners to use lower quality crude oil, which requires more hydrogen. In addition, recent mandates to reduce the sulfur levels of diesel fuel have also increased demand for hydrogen. Hydrogen can be transported from centralized plants by pipeline or tank truck, but a more practical option is manufacturing it on-site by a process known as steam reforming, which separates the hydrogen from natural gas. Steam reforming is a cost-effective means of sustaining the oil business, but not a viable way to energize a hydrogen economy. The available supply of natural gas simply is not adequate to support our growing needs to use it for generating electricity, heating our homes and meeting the hydrogen demands of industry. One downside to steam reforming is the amount of carbon dioxide — the main greenhouse gas — generated when hydrogen is extracted from natural gas this way. Steam reforming, used to produce 95 percent of the hydrogen supply for the United States, according to the Energy Department, releases 350 million tons of carbon dioxide a year. One possible way to offset that undesirable addition to the atmosphere is sequestration, collecting the carbon dioxide and storing it in the ocean or the ground. This plan shows some promise, but not on the scale required to support a hydrogen-powered future.

The variety and sophistication of the cars showed a striking improvement not just since the last Shanghai auto show two years ago, when Chinese automakers demonstrated scant technological innovation, but even in the months since the Beijing auto show last November. Universities and technical institutes across China have started advanced vehicle propulsion research programs, combining strong government financial backing with China’s growing ranks of skilled engineers. China, worried about severe air pollution and rising dependence on imported oil, has already imposed more stringent fuel economy standards than the United States — although not as strict as the semi-voluntary standards in the China plans to tighten its standards considerably next year. It has raised its consumption tax to as much as 20 percent on gas guzzlers, while cutting it to 1 percent for cars with small fuel-sipping engines. And it is studying the possibility of tax incentives for buyers of hybrids. and Volkswagen have begun cooperating closely with Chinese joint venture partners on the development of hybrid gasoline-electric vehicles. Larry Burns, G.M.’s vice president for research and development, said the company was in talks with a Chinese joint venture partner on sharing hydrogen fuel-cell technology as well. Xu Liuping, the chief executive of Changan Automobile in Chongqing, said the Chinese auto industry was hard working to save energy. “The speed will be accelerated because available energy supplies are dwindling and because of the environmental protection aspect,” Mr. Xu said in an interview at the Shanghai auto show. Changan showed a hybrid gasoline-electric minivan here. Mr. Xu said that he had lined up local governments that promised to use it, making it possible for Changan to start manufacturing the vehicle next year. Rick Wagoner, G.M.’s chairman and chief executive, and Nick Reilly, the president of G.M.’s Asian and Pacific regional operations, met on Thursday with senior Chinese officials in Beijing to discuss the company’s energy efficiency plans, Mr. Reilly said. The Chinese government has not chosen among options like electric battery cars, fuel cells, hybrids and ethanol combustion, but wants the industry to move quickly to find the best approach and adopt it. “It’s absolutely at the top of the agenda” of the Chinese leadership, Mr. Reilly said. Western environmentalists have long speculated whether China may actually leapfrog the West in personal transportation by embracing new automotive technologies before the country’s oil and auto industries can become too wedded to internal combustion engines. The odds of such a leapfrogging have eroded because nobody has yet surmounted the technological obstacles that prevent a broad switch from gasoline technology to hydrogen fuel cells, said An Feng, the executive director of the Innovation Center for Energy and Transportation in Beijing. Japanese companies, particularly Toyota and Honda, are already far ahead in the hybrid gasoline-electric designs that have proved more attractive lately to Chinese companies than fuel cells, said Kelly Sims Gallagher, the director of the Energy Technology Innovation Project at Harvard. Japanese companies also control many crucial patents on hybrid technology. Multinational automakers face repeated demands from Chinese joint venture partners to share the most advanced technology available. Katsumi Nakamura, the president and chief executive of Dongfeng Motor, a joint venture in Hubei Province between Nissan and the Dongfeng Group of China, said the Dongfeng side had tried to negotiate an agreement that would require the sharing of the latest technology. But at Nissan’s insistence, the final pact calls only for the sharing of “appropriate” technology. Auto executives are reluctant to mention the illegal copying of technology in China, a problem that discouraged Chrysler from even trying to build minivans in China in the 1990s. China’s vehicle market is now the second largest in the world, after the United States, and still expanding. It grew another 34 percent in the first two months of this year compared with the period a year earlier. Automakers have decided to risk the occasional piracy of existing designs but are still wary of sharing future technologies.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/automobiles/10toyota.html	Toyota Posts Another Record but Warns of Slowdown - New York Times Toyota Posts Another Record but Warns of Slowdown Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 10, 2007 TOKYO, May 9 — Toyota reported another year of record profit on Wednesday but signaled a slowdown in the current year because of weakness in North America and increased spending. Skip to next paragraph Toyota is poised to supplant General Motors as the world&#146;s largest carmaker. A vehicle is repaired at a Toyota dealership in Singapore. While American rivals like General Motors and Ford have reported losses of billions of dollars in recent years, Toyota announced its seventh consecutive year of record earnings, bolstered by the popularity of its fuel-efficient vehicles. Toyota said net profit jumped about 20 percent in the fiscal year ended in March, to 1.64 trillion yen ($13.68 billion). The results showed Toyota to be in robust shape as it prepares to end G.M.’s 76-year reign as the world’s largest automaker this year. Toyota reiterated its forecast of 9.34 million vehicle sales this calendar year for its entire group, which includes the minicar maker Daihatsu Motor and the truck maker Hino. In terms of annual sales, that would be enough to put it ahead of G.M., which expects to sell 9.2 million vehicles this year. Yet, despite last year’s strong showing, Toyota struck a cautious note in its forecast for the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2008. The company said it expected a modest 0.4 percent rise in net profit, to 1.65 trillion yen ($13.76 billion). The company attributed the forecast to what it called a “severe market” in North America, where Toyota earns about 60 percent of its profits. Toyota said it expected sales growth this year in North America to slow to 1.6 percent, down from 15.1 percent last year. Toyota also cited increased spending to build factories and develop new vehicles and technologies, like its popular gas-electric hybrids and more futuristic hydrogen-powered fuel-cell engines. The slowdown in profit growth “is temporary, as we are planting the seeds” of future growth, Toyota’s president, Katsuaki Watanabe, told reporters. “Earnings will improve again.” But some analysts called the forecast overly conservative. They said that while they expect profit growth to slow this year, Toyota may be giving a low estimate in order to reduce potential political fallout from its strong performance, particularly in the United States. Analysts pointed out that Toyota is still forecasting strong gains this year in the number of vehicles sold, up more than a half million vehicles from 2006; that, they said, should also lead to higher profits. Moreover, analysts noted that Toyota has made overly conservative profit forecasts before. A year ago, Toyota said it expected profits to drop in the recently ended fiscal year — the same period that produced the robust earnings growth announced Wednesday. Analysts estimated that net profit in the current fiscal year will most likely be closer to 1.74 trillion yen ($14.51 billion). “Toyota doesn’t see any upside in showing how strong it really is,” said Atsushi Kawai, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities in Tokyo. “It wants to avoid inviting jealousy and other negative reactions.” These concerns have been particularly acute in the United States, where control of Congress has recently shifted to traditionally labor-friendly Democrats. Many in Japan have worried that this could lead to fresh protectionist measures to control America’s ballooning trade deficit. Because of its size and growth, Toyota has felt particularly vulnerable to any possible trade retaliation. Like many Asian carmakers, Toyota has hired Washington lobbyists and invested billions in new plants in the United States in hopes of avoiding the sort of criticism it faced during the Japanese-American trade friction in the early 1990s. Toyota is scheduled to open its eighth North American factory in Mississippi in 2010. Mr. Watanabe, Toyota’s president, also tried to play down Toyota’s prospects of beating G.M. “Rather than think about other companies, I feel we must do our best to satisfy our worldwide customers,” he said. “There is still plenty for us to do.” Still, the results clearly painted a picture that has become all too familiar in the auto industry: Toyota roaring ahead as the Detroit automakers stumble. In addition to its strong annual earnings, Toyota posted an 8.9 percent gain in net profit in the January-March quarter, to 440.1 billion yen ($3.67 billion), as strong sales in the United States and Europe offset declines in Asia. By contrast, G.M. reported losses of $2 billion last year, after a $10.4 billion loss the year before. Ford reported losses of $12.7 billion last year and is not expected to turn a profit in North America before 2009. Chrysler, the unit of DaimlerChrysler, said that its loss was $1.5 billion last year. Toyota also gained on G.M. by another measure: size of annual revenue. Toyota said revenue last year rose 13.8 percent, to 23.95 trillion yen ($199.77 billion), just slightly behind G.M.’s revenue last year of $207 billion. In the current fiscal year, Toyota forecast a 4.4 percent rise in revenue, to 25 trillion yen ($208.52 billion). In North America, Toyota benefited from strong sales of its Lexus luxury line, RAV4 light sports utility vehicle and Camry sedan, the best-selling car in the United States for a fifth consecutive year. Toyota said vehicles sales in North America rose by 386,000 vehicles from the year before, to 2.9 million vehicles. To keep up with demand, Toyota has added Camry production at the Indiana plant of its affiliate, Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru. Toyota said it also planned to produce Camrys in Russia for sale there and elsewhere in Europe. Toyota said it expected sales to pick up this year in Asia outside China and Japan, where they dropped by 91,000 vehicles last year, to 789,000. The automaker also said it would increase spending this year to develop new cars and technologies by 5.5 percent to 940 billion yen ($7.84 billion).

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/automobiles/10toyota.html	Toyota Posts Another Record but Warns of Slowdown - New York Times Toyota Posts Another Record but Warns of Slowdown Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 10, 2007 TOKYO, May 9 — Toyota reported another year of record profit on Wednesday but signaled a slowdown in the current year because of weakness in North America and increased spending. Skip to next paragraph Toyota is poised to supplant General Motors as the world&#146;s largest carmaker. A vehicle is repaired at a Toyota dealership in Singapore. While American rivals like General Motors and Ford have reported losses of billions of dollars in recent years, Toyota announced its seventh consecutive year of record earnings, bolstered by the popularity of its fuel-efficient vehicles. Toyota said net profit jumped about 20 percent in the fiscal year ended in March, to 1.64 trillion yen ($13.68 billion). The results showed Toyota to be in robust shape as it prepares to end G.M.’s 76-year reign as the world’s largest automaker this year. Toyota reiterated its forecast of 9.34 million vehicle sales this calendar year for its entire group, which includes the minicar maker Daihatsu Motor and the truck maker Hino. In terms of annual sales, that would be enough to put it ahead of G.M., which expects to sell 9.2 million vehicles this year. Yet, despite last year’s strong showing, Toyota struck a cautious note in its forecast for the current fiscal year, which ends in March 2008. The company said it expected a modest 0.4 percent rise in net profit, to 1.65 trillion yen ($13.76 billion). The company attributed the forecast to what it called a “severe market” in North America, where Toyota earns about 60 percent of its profits. Toyota said it expected sales growth this year in North America to slow to 1.6 percent, down from 15.1 percent last year. Toyota also cited increased spending to build factories and develop new vehicles and technologies, like its popular gas-electric hybrids and more futuristic hydrogen-powered fuel-cell engines. The slowdown in profit growth “is temporary, as we are planting the seeds” of future growth, Toyota’s president, Katsuaki Watanabe, told reporters. “Earnings will improve again.” But some analysts called the forecast overly conservative. They said that while they expect profit growth to slow this year, Toyota may be giving a low estimate in order to reduce potential political fallout from its strong performance, particularly in the United States. Analysts pointed out that Toyota is still forecasting strong gains this year in the number of vehicles sold, up more than a half million vehicles from 2006; that, they said, should also lead to higher profits. Moreover, analysts noted that Toyota has made overly conservative profit forecasts before. A year ago, Toyota said it expected profits to drop in the recently ended fiscal year — the same period that produced the robust earnings growth announced Wednesday. Analysts estimated that net profit in the current fiscal year will most likely be closer to 1.74 trillion yen ($14.51 billion). “Toyota doesn’t see any upside in showing how strong it really is,” said Atsushi Kawai, an analyst at Mizuho Investors Securities in Tokyo. “It wants to avoid inviting jealousy and other negative reactions.” These concerns have been particularly acute in the United States, where control of Congress has recently shifted to traditionally labor-friendly Democrats. Many in Japan have worried that this could lead to fresh protectionist measures to control America’s ballooning trade deficit. Because of its size and growth, Toyota has felt particularly vulnerable to any possible trade retaliation. Like many Asian carmakers, Toyota has hired Washington lobbyists and invested billions in new plants in the United States in hopes of avoiding the sort of criticism it faced during the Japanese-American trade friction in the early 1990s. Toyota is scheduled to open its eighth North American factory in Mississippi in 2010. Mr. Watanabe, Toyota’s president, also tried to play down Toyota’s prospects of beating G.M. “Rather than think about other companies, I feel we must do our best to satisfy our worldwide customers,” he said. “There is still plenty for us to do.” Still, the results clearly painted a picture that has become all too familiar in the auto industry: Toyota roaring ahead as the Detroit automakers stumble. In addition to its strong annual earnings, Toyota posted an 8.9 percent gain in net profit in the January-March quarter, to 440.1 billion yen ($3.67 billion), as strong sales in the United States and Europe offset declines in Asia. By contrast, G.M. reported losses of $2 billion last year, after a $10.4 billion loss the year before. Ford reported losses of $12.7 billion last year and is not expected to turn a profit in North America before 2009. Chrysler, the unit of DaimlerChrysler, said that its loss was $1.5 billion last year. Toyota also gained on G.M. by another measure: size of annual revenue. Toyota said revenue last year rose 13.8 percent, to 23.95 trillion yen ($199.77 billion), just slightly behind G.M.’s revenue last year of $207 billion. In the current fiscal year, Toyota forecast a 4.4 percent rise in revenue, to 25 trillion yen ($208.52 billion). In North America, Toyota benefited from strong sales of its Lexus luxury line, RAV4 light sports utility vehicle and Camry sedan, the best-selling car in the United States for a fifth consecutive year. Toyota said vehicles sales in North America rose by 386,000 vehicles from the year before, to 2.9 million vehicles. To keep up with demand, Toyota has added Camry production at the Indiana plant of its affiliate, Fuji Heavy Industries, maker of Subaru. Toyota said it also planned to produce Camrys in Russia for sale there and elsewhere in Europe. Toyota said it expected sales to pick up this year in Asia outside China and Japan, where they dropped by 91,000 vehicles last year, to 789,000. The automaker also said it would increase spending this year to develop new cars and technologies by 5.5 percent to 940 billion yen ($7.84 billion).

Wolfe found that his used Honda had been badly damaged in an accident, which a Carfax report failed to mention. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 6, 2007 AN Ohio judge will decide on Friday whether to approve the settlement of a class-action suit against Carfax in which consumers could receive coupons worth about $20 and the lawyers representing them $566,000. The suit claims that Carfax, which sells vehicle histories to consumers worried about buying used cars, deceived customers by concealing the limits on the information it collects about crash damage. Some consumer groups oppose the settlement, saying consumers get no meaningful compensation and Carfax is not being forced to make clear in what way its information is limited. "Carfax wins the most," said Ronald Frederick of Cleveland, one of several lawyers who have filed a brief objecting to the settlement on behalf of Carfax customers and the Center for Auto Safety. William B. Federman of Oklahoma City, one of the lawyers who filed the suit and reached the agreement with Carfax, said consumers would be receiving the best possible deal because of a legal technicality that could have resulted in the court dismissing the lawsuit, which would have forced each consumer harmed by Carfax to file an individual suit. Carfax agreed to the settlement, but has denied wrongdoing. "Nowhere do we claim we have every accident," said Larry Gamache, a Carfax spokesman. "We can't even get our heads around how many accidents happen in the United States. There are a significant portion that go unreported." The suit claims that Carfax leads consumers to believe they are getting a thorough check of a vehicle's history, but Carfax did not have access to police accident reports "in almost half of the states in the United States." Indeed, in a deposition taken in 2003 by Rob Treinen, a lawyer from Albuquerque, for an unrelated suit, George C. Bounacos, Carfax's vice president for customer operations, said at that time that the company was getting police accident reports from about only half of the states. The class-action suit said Carfax did not receive reports from Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia. Mr. Gamache, the Carfax spokesman, said Carfax had improved its data collection since the suit was filed in 2004. "We get information contained in police accident reports from all these states," he said. As part of the proposed settlement, consumers who bought a report from Carfax before Oct. 27, 2006, when the settlement got preliminary approval by the court, would receive a coupon that provides them with two free Carfax vehicle history reports in the first year after final approval of the settlement or one free report within two years. Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group based in Washington, said the settlement did not give consumers anything to compensate them for their problems and financial losses. One of the consumers objecting to the settlement is David P. Wolfe of Lawrence, Kan. "It is like giving me nothing." Mr. Wolfe said he bought a Honda Civic in Texas relying on a Carfax report. A Honda dealer told him later that the car had been so badly damaged in a crash it was not safe to drive. Mr. Wolfe said he did not want the coupon. Should the settlement be approved, Carfax customers who purchased reports before Oct. 27, 2006, would lose the right to sue the company, except those who have already written and asked to be excluded from the class. However, the proposed agreement does not require Carfax to notify all consumers affected by the settlement. The company only has to send e-mail messages about the settlement to customers who bought Carfax reports from Oct. 27, 2005, to Oct. 27, 2006, because Mr. Gamache said the parties agreed that notifying customers for that year was enough. Lawyers objecting to the settlement said that means most customers would not know that they had lost their right to sue the company individually. Mr. Federman also said a legal technicality could have forced the case to be argued in Virginia if there had been no settlement because the fine print in the Carfax purchase agreement says courts in Virginia, where the company is based, must be used for legal disputes. Virginia, he said, does not allow consumer class-action suits, so each Carfax customer would have had to file a suit instead of being members of the class. But the Ohio court already considered that issue, rejecting a Carfax request to move the case to Virginia courts. The judge who will rule on the settlement, Andrew D. Logan of the Court of Common Pleas for Trumbull County, said the case would be tried in Ohio. Mr. Federman said the issue was still relevant because Carfax could still appeal that decision. Carfax must "change their business model," he said, and make it clearer on its Web site, carfax.com, that there are limits to its information. If the settlement is approved, Carfax will state that its reports "may not have the complete history of every vehicle." Those who object to the settlement said Carfax should be forced to clearly list its limits state by state. "It is very misleading," said Deepak Gupta, a lawyer for the consumer group Public Citizen, who helped write the objectors' brief. "We are not saying Carfax is worthless — far from it. But people need to know what information they have and what information they don't have and whether they need to supplement Carfax with actual inspections by mechanics," he said. He said the settlement failed consumers on every crucial point. "The people the case was supposed to be brought to benefit don't get anything," he said. "The class-action system isn't going to function if these kinds of settlements are allowed to stand." Judge Logan has already given the settlement preliminary approval. If he approves the settlement, consumers eager for their Carfax coupons should not delay. Under the current plan, requests must be postmarked no later than May 27.

Skip to next paragraph The Vehicles Thieves Covet Police cruisers arrived and blocked dozens of cars: Acuras, Ford Mustangs and at least one right-hand-drive Honda, imported illegally from Japan and modified for racing. By the time the tire smoke cleared, the police had arrested eight people, impounded 12 cars (five with what the police said were stolen engines or transmissions) and issued dozens of citations. Participating in the joint operation were officers from 10 Southern California police agencies and one civilian: Mike Bender, one of the country’s foremost authorities on auto theft. He accompanied the mission, as he has many others over the last decade, to help the police identify stolen car parts and to train officers to recognize the connections among street racing, auto theft and insurance fraud. Mr. Bender, 51, a former special agent for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, acts as a consultant to police departments and conducts auto-theft seminars around the country. His message is that thieves have gone high-tech, so the police need to go high-tech, too. To prove the point and destroy the myth that advanced antitheft systems are impenetrable, Mr. Bender often heads out to his garage to get his hands dirty and crack security systems himself. The police contact Mr. Bender for help when their cases get technical: for instance, when thieves override the transponder immobilizer systems in most new cars. In these antitheft systems, the vehicle is designed to start only when a chip inside the owner’s key sends the proper numeric signal to the vehicle’s internal computer. The technology, and attempts to circumvent it, can bewilder longtime theft investigators. “The poor guy gets a phone call from me every other week,” said Cpl. Jeff Higbee, an investigator with the Ontario Police Department in California, who participated in the Bell operation. “And he almost always has the answers.” In addition to offering help to the police (typically without charge), Mr. Bender holds regular training seminars. One last month near San Diego was entitled, “Auto Theft in the 21st Century.” Sixty insurance agents and police investigators from around the country paid $135 each to learn about topics like what to look for when a new security system is bypassed or the techniques thieves are using to alter vehicle identification numbers on stolen vehicles. The police have traditionally kept such conversations quiet, fearing they could tip off aspiring thieves. Mr. Bender’s mission is to bring investigators into the digital age and get them to share information, just as their adversaries are doing on Web sites, message boards and forums like YouTube, where dozens of videos show off car-hacking and street-racing techniques. “I don’t think there is anything we talk about at the seminars that isn’t on the Internet, being discussed by the other side,” Mr. Bender said. “In the past, we have only been keeping information from ourselves.” Mr. Bender’s rising profile among auto- theft investigators is partly a reaction to changes in the way thieves are stealing cars. In 1991, according to the ’s National Crime Information Center, 1.7 million cars were stolen. In its latest report, for 2005, the annual toll fell to 1.2 million, thanks partly, Mr. Bender said, to improving antitheft technology. But that good news has a dark lining. Fifteen years ago, nearly every stolen automobile was recovered. Young thieves often took cars for joyrides and then abandoned them. Today, according to the F.B.I., only 62 percent of vehicles are recovered. Professional crime rings are stripping cars or shipping them overseas, and antitheft technology is not stopping them. “There’s a reason we’re not recovering them,” Mr. Bender said. “The bad guys have evolved. They are much more sophisticated.” At the heart of Mr. Bender’s expertise is a curiosity about new technology and a long history battling auto theft. He began his career in the late 1970s as a beat officer and detective in the Los Angeles and Simi Valley police departments, then pursued a childhood interest in cars and migrated to the auto-theft department. In 1991, after retiring early from the police force, he joined the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit industry group devoted to fighting auto theft and insurance fraud. The bureau moved him to Santa Clara, Calif., in Silicon Valley, where he witnessed the arrival of street racing in that community. In 2003, Mr. Bender left the bureau and started a business, VinTrack, selling high-tech tools to help law enforcement authorities to identify stolen vehicle components. But most of his time is spent offering advice on cases and training the police. Next Article in Automobiles (37 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

He began his career in the late 1970s as a beat officer and detective in the Los Angeles and Simi Valley police departments, then pursued a childhood interest in cars and migrated to the auto-theft department. In 1991, after retiring early from the police force, he joined the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit industry group devoted to fighting auto theft and insurance fraud. The bureau moved him to Santa Clara, Calif., in Silicon Valley, where he witnessed the arrival of street racing in that community. In 2003, Mr. Bender left the bureau and started a business, VinTrack, selling high-tech tools to help law enforcement authorities to identify stolen vehicle components. But most of his time is spent offering advice on cases and training the police. Next Article in Automobiles (37 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 15, 2007 Skip to next paragraph The SX4 sedan will be available in the fall. $15,624 base; $16,724 as tested with automatic transmission. A 2-liter in-line 4; four-speed automatic; all-wheel drive. All SX4&#8217;s have six air bags, including head-protection curtains. Antilock brakes and a tire pressure monitor are standard. Traction control and electronic stability control are available only on the SX4 Sport. The government has not crash-tested the SX4. With the automatic gearbox, the rating is 24 miles a gallon in town, 30 on the highway. Honda Fit $14,650; Nissan Versa SL $15,550; Chrysler PT Cruiser $17,620. (All similarly equipped.) AS the new wave of economical hatchbacks ripples through the American auto market, the era of lumbering sport utility vehicles already seems as kitschy as towering tailfins or butterfly-collar disco shirts. The Suzuki SX4 wagon is taking advantage of this shift by straddling a razor-thin line between the baby sport utility and the all-wheel-drive economy car. The SX4 is only 162.8 inches long, half a foot shorter than the four-door Versa and only about five inches longer than the Fit. From the outside, the SX4&#8217;s squat dimensions, tall windows and large side mirrors, which bear some resemblance to Mickey Mouse&#8217;s ears, deliver a welcome dose of cuteness, a trait not usually found in the macho realm of S.U.V.&#8217;s. But the SX4&#8217;s best party trick is its standard all-wheel-drive system. A switch on the center console has three settings: front drive, four-wheel drive (which transfers power between the front and rear axles), or a four-wheel mode that locks the center differential for very slippery situations. So has Suzuki managed to obtain the station wagon equivalent of geek-chic? When you step inside, you realize that the huggable exterior is somewhat muted by a sober cabin. Expanses of gray plastic are brightened (but only a bit) by slivers of metallic-looking plastic on the center console and gearshift knob. The dashboard layout is clear, with easy-to-read gauges and large rotary knobs for the air-conditioner. The base four-speaker AM/FM/CD/MP3 and XM-ready stereo is a cinch to master, if a little tinny-sounding when the volume is cranked up. A nine-speaker stereo, with subwoofer and six-disc, in-dash CD player, is standard on the SX4 Sport. My basic test vehicle came with a four-speed automatic in lieu of the five-speed manual, but it lacked the $300 convenience package that includes cruise control and a leather-wrapped steering wheel with integrated audio controls. (I was stuck with a thin, slippery steering wheel instead.) On a more positive note, the smooth-shifting automatic did a fine job in mixed city and highway driving. The SX4&#8217;s steering is solid and agile. But with a curb weight of nearly 3,000 pounds, acceleration is merely adequate with the 143-horsepower 4-cylinder engine. Fuel economy is also just on the right side of O.K., and an 11-gallon tank limits the range to as little as 260 miles between fill-ups. Oddly, the SX4 carries a higher mileage rating with the automatic than with the manual. A ride through Manhattan, Brooklyn and Long Island proved the comfort of the suspension and cloth seats. With the 60/40 split-folding rear seat lowered, there is a useful 54.3 cubic feet for cargo. The cabin is roomy enough for four average-size adults. Air-conditioning, power windows and power locks are standard, and the six air bags include side curtains. It is too bad, though, that traction and stability controls are available only on the pricier SX4 Sport. The SX4 wagon will be joined this fall by a sedan version, introduced recently at the New York auto show. The SX4 lacks the lofty mileage figures and nimble demeanor of some competitors. Yet as a pint-size wagon with standard all-wheel drive, a roomy interior and a price around $15,000, it has little direct competition at all.

The industry faces the possibility of stiffer environmental rules. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 19, 2007 WASHINGTON, April 18 — Nissan Motor will offer its flagship Maxima sedan with a cleaner-burning diesel engine in the United States by 2010, the company’s chief executive, Carlos Ghosn, said on Wednesday, offering new details of a plan intended to resonate with environmentally conscious consumers and help Nissan meet new emissions rules. The timing of Nissan’s announcement and a visit here by Mr. Ghosn to meet with lawmakers and lobbyists — coming as the auto industry faces the possibility of stiffer environmental regulations — suggests that the automaker is looking to polish its image as a green company. Nissan, which would not be the first automaker to offer cleaner diesel technology in the United States, has been slower than other Japanese automakers in developing green technology. While Toyota and Honda have sold gasoline-electric hybrid models for years, Nissan did not begin selling one until January. But Mr. Ghosn said that consumer tastes and looming federal guidelines gave the company ample reasons to develop more environmentally friendly vehicles. “The global automotive industry has a responsibility to be part of the solutions that increase fuel efficiency,” he said in a speech here at the Council on Foreign Relations . He noted that the diesel Maxima would have up to 30 percent better fuel economy than the standard gasoline version. “We will be ready to offer our customers what they want.” Modern diesel technology, already widespread in Europe, is slowly making its way to the United States. The new engines are a far cry from the coughing, stinking diesel engines of the past, and have lower greenhouse gas emissions and better fuel economy than gasoline engines. offers a new-era diesel engine in the Mercedes E-Class, and has plans to start selling a diesel Grand Cherokee this year. , Honda, Audi, Volkswagen and BMW have plans sell diesel engines that meet federal guidelines in the future. But diesel engines have been less popular in Japan. Mr. Ghosn said on Wednesday that Nissan plans to sell the new diesel vehicles in Japan and China by 2010. Nissan has not said what percentage of its Maxima fleet in the United States or abroad would have diesel engines. Daniel F. Becker, director of the program, said the new engine would allow Nissan to make up for some of its past environmental missteps. “There are a number of categories in which Nissan is sort of a laggard among the Japanese leaders,” he said. “It’s good news that Nissan is trying to find ways to improve its environmental performance. If they follow the lead of Honda and Toyota, it can bring much cleaner, more fuel-efficient vehicles to market and make more money doing it.” With its sales and overall performance in a slump, Nissan is taking a hard look at what does, and does not, sell. “Consumers want environmentally friendly cars,” Mr. Ghosn said. “They want to have the pleasure of driving without the guilt.” Later, in answer to questions from reporters, Mr. Ghosn made it clear that the company would not buy Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler, which is looking at spinning off the money-losing division. “Some people are a little worried about Nissan,” he said. “So you don’t want to engage in anything like this.” He declined to address why the merger of Chrysler and Daimler-Benz did not seem to be working. Mr. Ghosn has faced questions himself about whether the alliance of Nissan and the French carmaker Renault is a failure. “If you want to know the reality, you have to be inside,” he said, adding that even from the inside, it is not always easy to tell why the business is stumbling. “The execution of alliances is something that’s extremely delicate.” Mr. Ghosn also offered his thoughts on the troubles in the American auto industry, which he said are probably cyclical. “We are used to hitting bumps and reflecting on them,” he said. “Hitting bumps is normal in our industry.” He added: “The mistake is to say, ‘Don’t worry. There’s no problem.’ ” Next Article in Automobiles (28 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/fashion/12cars.html	Gay by Design, or a Lifestyle Choice? - New York Times Gay by Design, or a Lifestyle Choice? Jeff Haynes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images (Subaru) Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 12, 2007 RON GEREN, an actor in Los Angeles, commutes to auditions and jobs throughout Southern California in a sleek black Mazda MX-5 Miata convertible. But for a recent date with a woman, he rented a Cadillac Escalade because he was so used to friends saying his Miata is “gay.” Skip to next paragraph Martina Navratilova in a 2001 ad for Subaru, known to some as &#147;Lesbaru.&#148; “Guys say, ‘Hey, that’s cute,’ ” Mr. Geren, 40, said, adding that the comments come from gay as well as straight men. “You have to fend off that perception.” A few years ago, Meghan Daum, an op-ed contributor to The Los Angeles Times, wrote about a promising first date with a man that never led to a second one because, she later learned, the guy saw that she drove a Subaru Outback station wagon and concluded she must be a lesbian. And when Joe LaMuraglia, the founder of , an informational site modeled on the likes of , told his partner he wanted to buy a Mini Cooper convertible, the boyfriend joked that he would not be seen in it because the couple “would look like such a gay cliché,” Mr. LaMuraglia said. Cars are no more straight or gay than cellphones, office chairs or weed whackers. But in recent years that truism has not stopped a perception among some motorists that certain cars can, in the right context, be statements about a driver’s sexual orientation. At a time when car makers are marketing aggressively to gay consumers and mainstream culture has become more literate about stereotypically gay tastes through television shows like “Will & Grace” and “The L Word” (on which one of the main characters, Alice, drove a Mini Cooper), it may not be surprising that some people make such assumptions about motorists based on their cars. Indeed, the extravagant displays of muscle car machismo and sensuous, high-design femininity on display this week at the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center would seem to cry out for deconstruction along gender- and sexual-identity lines. But to some people, such stereotyping is homophobia, pure and simple. A poll seeking to determine the most gay automobiles, conducted by a South African Web site, was a topic of heated interest last December on Gizmodo, the New York-based technology blog, where one reader wrote: “Since when are cars gay or straight? We’re really polling people’s prejudices here.” Others, though, including gay theorists, say many gay motorists happily embrace certain cars as reflections of identity. “People presume you want to throw off a stereotype,” said Judith Halberstam, a lesbian who is a professor of gender studies at the University of Southern California . She drives a black Mazda 3 hatchback that she considers “butch.” But, she said, “If you are a masculine woman, you might not feel bad about it, so you might become excited about knowing how to fix your pickup, or driving a ’68 Mustang.” “Not all gays want to present an image that is normative,” she said. Ramone Johnson is a gay journalist and former Saturn engineer who compiles an annual “Top 10 Gay Cars” list for About.com, which is owned by The New York Times Company. Mr. Johnson said that “traditionally we are used to being defined by others.” Driving a stylish car can be a way of “taking control back” and saying “this is who I am,” he said. Mr. Johnson maintains that “soft lines” and a “vibrant personality” — say like those on a Volkswagen New Beetle — are typical attributes of a gay man’s car, and fashion-forward red gauges and other styling cues, for example, make the Pontiac G6 more of a gay car than its sibling, the Grand Am, because the features express a taste for freedom and fun. Neither automobile manufacturers nor dealers compile statistics on the sexual orientation of buyers. Frank Markus, who is gay and the technical director for Motor Trend magazine, said auto companies tend to associate gay consumers with higher disposable incomes since fewer have children (one reason many are free to opt for less practical cars, like two-seaters or convertibles, as well). Tellingly, when the American Family Association, a conservative Christian group, pressured the Ford Motor Company to pull advertising from gay publications like The Advocate in 2005, the ads were for Land Rover and Jaguar, two high-end brands owned by Ford. Subaru has been the most prominent company to embrace the gay market. As long ago as 2000, the automaker created advertising campaigns around , the gay tennis star, and also used a sales slogan that was a subtle gay-rights message: “It’s not a choice. It’s the way we’re built.” Little wonder that many lesbians refer to their Outbacks as “Lesbarus.” Even General Motors recently began to include questions about sexual orientation on some internal market surveys, although data are not yet compiled, said Adam Bernard, who tracks the product strategies of G.M.’s competitors and who also coordinates an advocacy group for gay employees at the company called GM Plus. Since 2003, he said, the group has consulted with marketing executives at the company about increasing sales to gay consumers.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/12/fashion/12cars.html	Gay by Design, or a Lifestyle Choice? - New York Times Gay by Design, or a Lifestyle Choice? Jeff Haynes/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images (Subaru) Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 12, 2007 RON GEREN, an actor in Los Angeles, commutes to auditions and jobs throughout Southern California in a sleek black Mazda MX-5 Miata convertible. But for a recent date with a woman, he rented a Cadillac Escalade because he was so used to friends saying his Miata is “gay.” Skip to next paragraph Martina Navratilova in a 2001 ad for Subaru, known to some as &#147;Lesbaru.&#148; “Guys say, ‘Hey, that’s cute,’ ” Mr. Geren, 40, said, adding that the comments come from gay as well as straight men. “You have to fend off that perception.” A few years ago, Meghan Daum, an op-ed contributor to The Los Angeles Times, wrote about a promising first date with a man that never led to a second one because, she later learned, the guy saw that she drove a Subaru Outback station wagon and concluded she must be a lesbian. And when Joe LaMuraglia, the founder of , an informational site modeled on the likes of , told his partner he wanted to buy a Mini Cooper convertible, the boyfriend joked that he would not be seen in it because the couple “would look like such a gay cliché,” Mr. LaMuraglia said. Cars are no more straight or gay than cellphones, office chairs or weed whackers. But in recent years that truism has not stopped a perception among some motorists that certain cars can, in the right context, be statements about a driver’s sexual orientation. At a time when car makers are marketing aggressively to gay consumers and mainstream culture has become more literate about stereotypically gay tastes through television shows like “Will & Grace” and “The L Word” (on which one of the main characters, Alice, drove a Mini Cooper), it may not be surprising that some people make such assumptions about motorists based on their cars. Indeed, the extravagant displays of muscle car machismo and sensuous, high-design femininity on display this week at the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center would seem to cry out for deconstruction along gender- and sexual-identity lines. But to some people, such stereotyping is homophobia, pure and simple. A poll seeking to determine the most gay automobiles, conducted by a South African Web site, was a topic of heated interest last December on Gizmodo, the New York-based technology blog, where one reader wrote: “Since when are cars gay or straight? We’re really polling people’s prejudices here.” Others, though, including gay theorists, say many gay motorists happily embrace certain cars as reflections of identity. “People presume you want to throw off a stereotype,” said Judith Halberstam, a lesbian who is a professor of gender studies at the University of Southern California . She drives a black Mazda 3 hatchback that she considers “butch.” But, she said, “If you are a masculine woman, you might not feel bad about it, so you might become excited about knowing how to fix your pickup, or driving a ’68 Mustang.” “Not all gays want to present an image that is normative,” she said. Ramone Johnson is a gay journalist and former Saturn engineer who compiles an annual “Top 10 Gay Cars” list for About.com, which is owned by The New York Times Company. Mr. Johnson said that “traditionally we are used to being defined by others.” Driving a stylish car can be a way of “taking control back” and saying “this is who I am,” he said. Mr. Johnson maintains that “soft lines” and a “vibrant personality” — say like those on a Volkswagen New Beetle — are typical attributes of a gay man’s car, and fashion-forward red gauges and other styling cues, for example, make the Pontiac G6 more of a gay car than its sibling, the Grand Am, because the features express a taste for freedom and fun. Neither automobile manufacturers nor dealers compile statistics on the sexual orientation of buyers. Frank Markus, who is gay and the technical director for Motor Trend magazine, said auto companies tend to associate gay consumers with higher disposable incomes since fewer have children (one reason many are free to opt for less practical cars, like two-seaters or convertibles, as well). Tellingly, when the American Family Association, a conservative Christian group, pressured the Ford Motor Company to pull advertising from gay publications like The Advocate in 2005, the ads were for Land Rover and Jaguar, two high-end brands owned by Ford. Subaru has been the most prominent company to embrace the gay market. As long ago as 2000, the automaker created advertising campaigns around , the gay tennis star, and also used a sales slogan that was a subtle gay-rights message: “It’s not a choice. It’s the way we’re built.” Little wonder that many lesbians refer to their Outbacks as “Lesbarus.” Even General Motors recently began to include questions about sexual orientation on some internal market surveys, although data are not yet compiled, said Adam Bernard, who tracks the product strategies of G.M.’s competitors and who also coordinates an advocacy group for gay employees at the company called GM Plus. Since 2003, he said, the group has consulted with marketing executives at the company about increasing sales to gay consumers. Lacking a precise portrait of its gay car buyers, the company still has taken increasing strides to break into this market, Mr. Bernard said, advertising its Cadillac, Saturn and Saab divisions in gay publications and Web sites like Company executives, he said, do not seem to feel skittish about losing market share among straight consumers if gay buyers suddenly seize on a particular model. “I don’t think internally we ever asked the question, ‘If we put Cadillac in The Advocate, are we going to lose straight Cadillac buyers?’ ” “Frankly,” he added, “the money’s all the same color.” Mr. Markus of Motor Trend said clichés about gay drivers tend to collapse on close inspection, like the gay man who is a “gym bunny” and gravitates toward Jeeps and convertibles “to show off his hot body.” But, he added, “If you could actually push a button and see what every gay person drives, it’s probably not too different from what the average person drives, but it might skew higher in price.” On Gaywheels.com, one indicator of actual gay buying trends is the list of vehicles most frequently researched.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/automobiles/13DUBAI.html	In the Desert Near Dubai, an Oasis for Drag Racing - New York Times In the Desert Near Dubai, an Oasis for Drag Racing Daryl Visscher for The New York Times The Emirates Motorplex is about an hour&#146;s drive from Dubai. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 UMM AL QAYWAYN, United Arab Emirates Skip to next paragraph Daryl Visscher for The New York Times The police have cracked down on drag racing on Jumeirah Beach Road in Dubai. LAST month at the Emirates Motorplex, Ahmed Rashid al-Hajji sat in the stands with a small group of friends, quietly sizing up the competition. In March he had been out on the track himself and had planned to be racing in April. “My car was ready until Wednesday night,” he said. “I was tuning my car in my friend’s garage, but there my luck was bad. So, inshallah,” or God willing, “next time.” Not that long ago, Mr. Hajji would have been on Jumeirah Beach Road, a long stretch of highway that runs through Dubai, pitting his souped-up Nissan Skyline GT-R 33 against Lamborghinis and Mercedes-Benz SL55s. But drivers said that a crackdown on aggressive driving by the Dubai police discouraged street racing, so Mr. Hajji’s Skyline sat at home for five months. “Then one of my friends told me, ‘Why don’t you go to the track?’ ” he said, referring to the Emirates Motorplex. He took the suggestion and earned fourth place in his debut run. There are many stories like his at the motorplex, a complex for quarter-mile drag racing deep in the desert of the Umm al Qaywayn emirate (one of the seven that make up the United Arab Emirates), about an hour’s drive northeast of Dubai. Although still relatively off the mainstream radar, the complex has become a safe way for Emirates gearheads to get off local roads to test their mettle on a track instead. The track was created by Sheik Marwan al-Mualla, son of the ruler of Umm al Qaywayn and chairman of the Emirates Motor Sports Federation. He financed the building of the track with his own money, initially as a way for his friends and him to compete against one another. He sees the track as a way to reduce accidents by providing drivers with a safe environment. “We have safety here, paramedics, an ambulance, and we give out trophies to the winners, something they can’t get on the street,” said Sheik Mualla, who no longer races on the track. “So what’s the reason to race out on the main roads?” Depending on whom you ask, Dubai is either a driver’s dream or a nightmare. Dubai is among the few cities of its size — it has a population of about 1.35 million — to have been built almost entirely after the invention of the automobile, which is apparent in the city’s general layout: a kind of Le Corbusien fantasy of skyscrapers, superhighways, sprawling shopping complexes and cities within cities, with little public transportation. Here, driving is a necessity. Cars are more than a means of transportation, however: With a real growth rate in gross domestic product of 10.2 percent in 2006, local Emiratis are making a lot of money, and automobiles are a highly visible expression of wealth, power and ambition. Not surprisingly, this has helped make Dubai a playground for high-octane thrill-seekers once the sun goes down and the traffic thins out. This aggressiveness makes Dubai a dangerous place to drive. Despite some successful efforts, including the recent installation of speed bumps along Jumeirah Beach Road, the Dubai Road and Transport Authority reported that road fatalities had increased by 32 percent from 2005 to 2006, with 312 people killed in Dubai last year. Judging by the stories of the drag racers at the Emirates Motorplex, the idea of competing in front of cheering crowds on Thursdays and Fridays once a month is capturing the imagination of former street racers. Similar factors in Southern California led to a proliferation of drag-racing parks in the 1950s in attempts to rein in street racing. In the U.A.E., this hasn’t meant the end of street racing any more than it did in California, but according to Abdulla Essa, manager of the traffic department of Umm al Qaywayn, there has been a decrease in accidents among young drivers in the emirate over the last four years. The motorplex, which also has tracks for motocross and all-terrain vehicles, has an overwhelmingly local feel. These aren’t your average Pabst Blue Ribbon-drinking spectators — and it’s not simply because there’s no drinking allowed on the premises.

Now it turns out that selling Chrysler isn&#8217;t all that easy either. The effort by DaimlerChrysler to find a buyer for Chrysler is becoming a drawn-out, complicated process that barely advanced this week, bogged down by issues including debt, Chrysler&#8217;s health care liability and the role of the union, bankers involved in the negotiations said. Moreover, none of the bidders appear to be in a rush to snap up the struggling car company. On Friday, the Canadian automobile supplier Magna International confirmed the widely reported speculation that it was among those interested in Chrysler. But Magna, in a statement, said, &#8220;There is no assurance that any transaction will result from Magna&#8217;s current involvement.&#8221; Even if they represent firm offers, the proposals are likely to be laden with contingencies and requirements that DaimlerChrysler might find too onerous to accept, the bankers said. They insisted on anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the talks. That raises the possibility that some or all of the bidders eventually could drop out, these bankers and industry analysts said. &#8220;We are really at the very early stage of the process,&#8221; Stefano Aversa, co-president of AlixPartners, a restructuring firm based in Southfield, Mich., said Wednesday. &#8220;It won&#8217;t be an easy decision for DaimlerChrysler. This is not going to be by any means just a simple acquisition.&#8221; Investors, who sent DaimlerChrysler shares to a new high last week when the billionaire investor offered to pay $4.5 billion for Chrysler, apparently do not like the cold shoulder that he is getting from the company. DaimlerChrysler shares ended the week at $82.26, down 76 cents Friday. By contrast, the shares closed at $84.80 on April 5 when Mr. Kerkorian&#8217;s bid came to light. Mr. Kerkorian made his bid public after , which is handling the Chrysler sale, failed to send his advisers the packet of information that was given to other bidders. And while company officials held meetings with some of those bidders in New York this week, Mr. Kerkorian&#8217;s representatives apparently were not included. The animosity has deep roots. Mr. Kerkorian, who as Chrysler&#8217;s biggest shareholder constantly pushed it to place more emphasis on shareholder returns, sued DaimlerChrysler in 2000. He asserted that he had been misled into supporting the deal by the assertions of executives that it was a &#8220;merger of equals&#8221; instead of a takeover by Daimler-Benz. A federal judge ruled against Mr. Kerkorian in 2005. Thus far, Chrysler has drawn interest from two investment firms &#151; Cerberus Capital and the Blackstone Group &#151; as well as Magna, which is involved in a number of production ventures with DaimlerChrysler. But the discussions, which this week included R&#252;diger Grube, a DaimlerChrysler board member, have not yet begun to narrow down the particulars, the bankers who have been advising those bidders said. Although some reports have said DaimlerChrysler would like to focus on a leading candidate by the end of the month, these advisers said it could take weeks more for the potential bidders to get a true picture of how any transaction was likely to be structured. Further, there seems to be no hurry on the part of either DaimlerChrysler or the bidders to come up with a price for Chrysler, which is likely to be billions less than Daimler-Benz paid. The old price is &#8220;not material&#8221; to the current discussions, Mr. Aversa of AlixPartners said. Daimler-Benz paid $36 billion for Chrysler in 1998 in what was originally termed a &#8220;merger of equals&#8221; but turned out to be a takeover by the German automaker of the American company. In February, Mr. Zetsche, who played pitchman as Dr. Z in Chrysler commercials, said the company was keeping its options open for Chrysler. Chrysler lost $1.5 billion last year, and has required two restructurings in the last seven years. Valuing an independent Chrysler is particularly difficult because it does not have independently traded shares and because transferring ownership of a huge automaker at a time of such turmoil in the industry is complex. The only means for determining a fair value will come from a potential buyer&#8217;s plan to restructure Chrysler, Mr. Aversa said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure the business plan is not going to be just business as usual, given the losses,&#8221; he said. Indeed, bankers say the discussions have centered less on the overall value of Chrysler and more on issues surrounding the company, like the debt load that DaimlerChrysler carries on Chrysler&#8217;s behalf, a burden it might want to transfer to the new owners. The company also is far from resolving what it might do about the $18 billion liability it faces for current and future health care coverage for employees. Mr. Kerkorian, in his bid, suggested that the liability be shared between the Tracinda Corporation, his investment arm, and DaimlerChrysler, but other bidders may push for DaimlerChrysler to absorb the entire expense. Likewise, it is far from clear what role the U.A.W. would play under new ownership. The U.A.W.&#8217;s president, Ron Gettelfinger, who sits on the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board and has a vote in the outcome, has said he would prefer that Chrysler remain under DaimlerChrysler&#8217;s wing, rather than be sold to private investors. The president of the union, Basil Hargrove, has said he opposes a sale to Mr. Kerkorian. The situation is easily as complicated as the sale by last year to Cerberus of a 51 percent stake in its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, said one person involved in the Chrysler discussions. In that case, the estimated price of the G.M.A.C. stake fell several times as G.M. looked for buyers. Early on, analysts estimated G.M. might get as much as $16 billion for half of G.M.A.C. But those estimates dropped to about $11 billion, after G.M.&#8217;s auto sales declined and the company encountered problems at Residential Capital, its residential mortgage unit. The final agreement, announced a year ago, was for $7.4 billion from a consortium headed by Cerberus, along with $2.7 billion in G.M.A.C. assets that G.M. credited to Cerberus. G.M. said last month that it would pay settlement charges of $1 billion to reflect changes in G.M.A.C.&#8217;s balance sheet, and analysts say more revisions may be in store for the G.M.A.C. deal.

In February, Mr. Zetsche, who played pitchman as Dr. Z in Chrysler commercials, said the company was keeping its options open for Chrysler. Chrysler lost $1.5 billion last year, and has required two restructurings in the last seven years. Valuing an independent Chrysler is particularly difficult because it does not have independently traded shares and because transferring ownership of a huge automaker at a time of such turmoil in the industry is complex. The only means for determining a fair value will come from a potential buyer&#8217;s plan to restructure Chrysler, Mr. Aversa said. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure the business plan is not going to be just business as usual, given the losses,&#8221; he said. Indeed, bankers say the discussions have centered less on the overall value of Chrysler and more on issues surrounding the company, like the debt load that DaimlerChrysler carries on Chrysler&#8217;s behalf, a burden it might want to transfer to the new owners. The company also is far from resolving what it might do about the $18 billion liability it faces for current and future health care coverage for employees. Mr. Kerkorian, in his bid, suggested that the liability be shared between the Tracinda Corporation, his investment arm, and DaimlerChrysler, but other bidders may push for DaimlerChrysler to absorb the entire expense. Likewise, it is far from clear what role the U.A.W. would play under new ownership. The U.A.W.&#8217;s president, Ron Gettelfinger, who sits on the DaimlerChrysler supervisory board and has a vote in the outcome, has said he would prefer that Chrysler remain under DaimlerChrysler&#8217;s wing, rather than be sold to private investors. The president of the union, Basil Hargrove, has said he opposes a sale to Mr. Kerkorian. The situation is easily as complicated as the sale by last year to Cerberus of a 51 percent stake in its financing arm, the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, said one person involved in the Chrysler discussions. In that case, the estimated price of the G.M.A.C. stake fell several times as G.M. looked for buyers. Early on, analysts estimated G.M. might get as much as $16 billion for half of G.M.A.C. But those estimates dropped to about $11 billion, after G.M.&#8217;s auto sales declined and the company encountered problems at Residential Capital, its residential mortgage unit. The final agreement, announced a year ago, was for $7.4 billion from a consortium headed by Cerberus, along with $2.7 billion in G.M.A.C. assets that G.M. credited to Cerberus. G.M. said last month that it would pay settlement charges of $1 billion to reflect changes in G.M.A.C.&#8217;s balance sheet, and analysts say more revisions may be in store for the G.M.A.C. deal.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/automobiles/02auto.html	A Crossover Helps Ford, but Not Enough to Hold Its No. 2 Spot - New York Times A Crossover Helps Ford, but Not Enough to Hold Its No. 2 Spot The Ford Edge crossover vehicles, introduced late last year, sat on a dealer&#146;s lot in Detroit in February. The vehicle has failed to generate the sales that Ford&#146;s big sport utility vehicles once did. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 2, 2007 DETROIT, May 1 — Is the Edge giving Ford the edge it was hoping for? Skip to next paragraph At the very least, the new crossover vehicle is keeping sales at the Ford Motor Company from dropping even more than they already are this year, at a time when the company is pulling back on unprofitable sales to rental-car companies. Ford is meeting the expectations it set for the Edge when the vehicle went on sale in December. But the Edge is not generating the revenue of the big sport utility vehicles that once fueled Ford’s profits, and it is not drawing the new customers that the company will need to bounce back from its worst loss in history — $12.7 billion last year. Ford’s falling sales have allowed the Toyota Motor Corporation of Japan to replace it as the second-largest seller of vehicles in the United States, after General Motors, through the first four months. And there is the question of buzz: Ford has pulled out all the stops to promote the Edge, with television ads directed by the playwright David Mamet in its latest attempt to get attention for the vehicle. Yet there are already lease deals available for the Edge, and some Ford insiders are concerned that its price, which starts at $25,995, is too high to sustain current sales levels once the vehicle’s novelty wears off — further proof that in today’s ultra-competitive car market, automakers have only a brief window to make a splash. Since arriving at dealerships in December, the Edge has been one of the few bright spots for Ford. On Tuesday, when automakers reported sales for April, Ford said its overall sales in April fell 7 percent on a selling-day adjusted basis; a distinction made because a year ago, there were two more selling days in April. Without the Edge and two other new crossovers in its lineup, Ford’s decline last month would have been 12 percent, the worst among major automakers. Ford has sold 33,600 units of the Edge so far this year, on pace for its goal of selling 100,000 units in all of 2007. But the company’s chief sales analyst, George Pipas, said many of those had been bought by people who already owned Fords. “The products that are most traded in are other Ford products,” Mr. Pipas said. “It’s retaining Ford buyers who were in traditional S.U.V.’s that are moving into another category.” To be sure, Ford needed vehicles that could keep its customers from defecting to other brands, particularly as high gasoline prices lead consumers to seek more fuel-efficient vehicles. But the Edge alone can do little to help Ford reach its goal of earning a profit in North America by 2009. “Crossovers are not the cash cows that the Ford Explorers and Expeditions were,” said Ron Pinelli, president of the Autodata Corporation, the industry research company based in Woodcliff Lake, N.J. “There’s just not enough volume there for Ford to make up for what they’ve lost,” Mr. Pinelli said. “Even if the Edge is doing incredibly well, the profit contribution isn’t going to be terrific, and there aren’t going to be enough of them to move the scale from the loss side to the profit side.” The Edge was not enough to stop Ford’s market share from falling to 17 percent from 18 percent a year ago, according to Autodata; the decline was the largest among all major automakers. G.M.’s market share slipped to 23 percent from 23.5 percent, while the Chrysler Group had a rare increase, to 14.4 percent from 13.1 percent. Toyota leads all automakers in worldwide sales. Chrysler, which could be sold in the coming months by its German parent, DaimlerChrysler, surprised analysts by saying its April sales rose 10 percent. Chrysler executives attributed the gain to a well-organized incentive program, including free DVD players in its minivans and discounts on the Dodge Ram pickup, as well as a successful 96-hour sale at the end of the month. “We were just very fortunate to catch the wind when we did in April,” said Steven J. Landry, Chrysler’s executive vice president for North American sales and global marketing. “We had a very strong close.” Meanwhile, Japanese automakers had an uncharacteristically weak month, with Honda’s sales down 1.6 percent and Nissan’s down 11.2 percent. Toyota posted a 3.7 percent sales increase, its lowest year-over-year gain since August 2004. Although Ford came in slightly ahead of it for the month, Toyota has sold nearly 5,000 more vehicles than Ford so far this year. Yet there are signs of some bumps in the road for Toyota, like an inventory that has grown 30 percent in the last year. Many of those unsold vehicles may be the new Tundra pickups; Toyota has sold about 43,000 Tundras since the truck went on sale in February, well below the pace needed to reach its goal of selling 200,000 this year. But because the Tundra makes more money for Toyota than the Edge does for Ford, the Edge cannot necessarily be called the more successful of the two. Still, Ford and its dealers say they are thrilled with the Edge. Mr. Pipas of Ford said it was competing well against crossover models from Toyota, Honda and Nissan. “The sales levels, really coming from having no brand recognition, are kind of in the same sandbox as three really great products that have established themselves over the course of several years,” Mr. Pipas said. “I don’t know if I thought we could get there that soon.” Ron Christiano, general manager of Cortese Ford in Rochester, said customers liked the Edge because it used less gas than an S.U.V. The Edge increased traffic to the dealership more quickly than Ford’s Fusion sedan, which has sold well since its introduction in 2005, he said. Correction: May 4, 2007 A picture in the auto sales chart in Business Day on Wednesday was published in error. It showed a Nissan Altima Coupe, which is not on the market yet, rather than the Altima sedan, which had a 12.4 percent drop in sales in April.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 FERRARI cleans out its garage, so to speak, with an auction at its track near Maranello, Italy, on May 20. You can call it a factory sale or you can call it more grandly the Leggenda e Passione auction, as RM Auctions does. A sale at the factory suggests surplus stacked on the loading dock or samples outside a Seventh Avenue loft. But when the factory is Ferrari’s, you don’t just drive up in your van. Ferrari allowed RM Auctions to handle the sale as part of the automaker’s 60th-anniversary celebration and to call attention to its new services of certifying and restoring vintage Ferraris. The auction is the first sale in Europe for RM Auctions, the Canadian company that is collaborating on this sale with Sotheby’s. The star of the event is a 1962 Ferrari 330 TRI/LM Testa Rossa, the only 4-liter and the last racing Testa Rossa by Ferrari. It was driven by the endurance racers Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien. The other stars of the sale are cars well known to Ferrari buffs, well traveled to shows and concours and often auctioned. Built in runs of 10 or a dozen, these are cars that buffs know by their chassis numbers. Some are simply legendary pieces of engineering and design, like the most powerful Ferrari of its era, the 1953 Ferrari 340MM, with a 4.1-liter, 300-horsepower V-12. Some are famous for their drivers, like the 1970 Ferrari 512 S raced by Luigi Chinetti’s North American Racing Team twice at Sebring or the 1966 Ferrari Dino 206 SP. An alloy-body competition version of the short-wheelbase 1960 250 GT will also be offered, as well as a prototype of the F40 supercar. Those with a more modest bidding budget will be drawn to the actual garage items — perhaps one of the more than 100 lots of racing memorabilia from the Ferrari archives — the real basement tapes. The show is also aimed to highlight Ferrari Classiche, the specialist division established for documenting, authenticating and restoring vintage Ferraris. In less than a year, it has carried out nearly 500 certifications and restored 84 cars at its workshop. There could be a big headline from the sale. RM may earn bragging rights to the top price ever paid for an automobile sold at auction. Next Article in Automobiles (4 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/automobiles/autoreviews/06AUTO.html	Review - 2007 Toyota Tundra - Test Drive - New York Times Behind the Wheel | 2007 Toyota Tundra Going Where Toyota’s Never Gone Before The 2007 Toyota Tundra Double Cab. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 6, 2007 LAST year, when Nathalie Guiraudet heard that Toyota was making the next-generation Tundra much bigger, she began to fret about her vehicular future. Skip to next paragraph She thought the size of her 2002 Tundra was perfect for her needs. She could haul plenty of hay for her horse, Kismet. It was easy to back up (the truck, not Kismet) and the fuel economy was acceptable (both the Tundra and Kismet). But Toyota has its own needs, and these include growth. By finally offering a pickup big and powerful enough to compete with the Ford F-150 and the Chevrolet Silverado, Toyota says it might double Tundra sales, which totaled an unimpressive 124,500 in 2006, just a fraction of what Chevrolet or Ford sold. While Ms. Guiraudet, who lives in Bethlehem, N.H., a town of 2,300 about 150 miles north of Boston, did not wish to interfere with Toyota&#8217;s apparent plan for galactic domination, she was dismayed. &#8220;It is like every good television show I ever liked,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It gets taken off the air.&#8221; So she responded to Toyota&#8217;s plan with a pre-emptive purchase: she bought a 2006 Tundra Access Cab. Now the 2007 Tundra is on sale, assembled at plants in Indiana and Texas. The new model is about 5 inches taller, 4 inches wider and 10 inches longer than its equivalent predecessors. Gone is the front-end styling so reserved it suggested a meek effort to assimilate, not cause trouble. The 2007 design could not be more confrontational if it had revolvers mounted on the fenders like one of Roy Rogers&#8217;s cars. For Tundra, three is a recurring theme. There are three bed sizes, three cabs and three engines. The standard bed is 6-foot-7; the long bed is 8-foot-2; and the short bed is 5-foot-7. There is a Regular Cab with comfortable seating for two and a surprising amount of cargo space behind the seats. The Double Cab has just enough room for four six-foot adults to be comfortable; access to the rear is through short forward-hinged doors. Last is the four-door CrewMax, imposing because the cab is so large it suggests an auditorium on wheels. Inside there is so much room it feels more like a large sport utility than a pickup. Its amazing 44.5 inches of rear legroom is almost 10 inches more than the Double Cab&#8217;s, making it entirely suitable for family transportation. A 236-horsepower 4-liter V-6 is available, but only on two-wheel drive Regular Cab and Double Cab models. With a five-speed automatic, it is rated at 17 m.p.g. in town and 20 on the highway, which is less than last year. A 4.7-liter V-8 is rated at 271 horsepower at 5,400 r.p.m. and 313 pound-feet of torque at 3,400 r.p.m. It comes with a five-speed automatic. Despite the increase in the Tundra&#8217;s size, the fuel economy estimate is unchanged from last year: 15 m.p.g. city and 18 highway for a four-wheel drive. New this year is a 5.7-liter V-8 rated at 381 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m. and 401 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 r.p.m. It comes with a six-speed automatic. Demand for this engine &#151; more than 70 percent of new Tundras have it &#151; has been greater than expected. With four-wheel drive, this engine is rated at 14 m.p.g. city and 18 highway. I averaged 18 m.p.g. on a 239-mile Interstate cruise at 65 m.p.h. Prices on the Tundra start at $22,935 for a two-wheel drive Regular Cab. The least expensive four-wheel-drive model is a Regular Cab, at $27,125. The most expensive Tundra is $42,495: that&#8217;s the CrewMax with four-wheel drive and the 5.7-liter V-8. The Tundra&#8217;s base prices are high compared with the new Chevrolet Silverado&#8217;s. But the Tundra offers more standard equipment on base models, including life savers like an electronic stability control to deal with skids and side curtains to provide head protection in a side-impact crash. My test truck was a Double Cab in the midlevel SR5 trim. It had the standard bed, four-wheel drive and the 5.7-liter V-8. The base price was $31,805. Options included an upgraded stereo and power front seats, bringing the total to $34,648. Toyota says the design and engineering were done in the United States, so it is not surprising that the front seats are wide American-size berths.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/automobiles/autoreviews/06AUTO.html	Review - 2007 Toyota Tundra - Test Drive - New York Times Behind the Wheel | 2007 Toyota Tundra Going Where Toyota’s Never Gone Before The 2007 Toyota Tundra Double Cab. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 6, 2007 LAST year, when Nathalie Guiraudet heard that Toyota was making the next-generation Tundra much bigger, she began to fret about her vehicular future. Skip to next paragraph She thought the size of her 2002 Tundra was perfect for her needs. She could haul plenty of hay for her horse, Kismet. It was easy to back up (the truck, not Kismet) and the fuel economy was acceptable (both the Tundra and Kismet). But Toyota has its own needs, and these include growth. By finally offering a pickup big and powerful enough to compete with the Ford F-150 and the Chevrolet Silverado, Toyota says it might double Tundra sales, which totaled an unimpressive 124,500 in 2006, just a fraction of what Chevrolet or Ford sold. While Ms. Guiraudet, who lives in Bethlehem, N.H., a town of 2,300 about 150 miles north of Boston, did not wish to interfere with Toyota&#8217;s apparent plan for galactic domination, she was dismayed. &#8220;It is like every good television show I ever liked,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It gets taken off the air.&#8221; So she responded to Toyota&#8217;s plan with a pre-emptive purchase: she bought a 2006 Tundra Access Cab. Now the 2007 Tundra is on sale, assembled at plants in Indiana and Texas. The new model is about 5 inches taller, 4 inches wider and 10 inches longer than its equivalent predecessors. Gone is the front-end styling so reserved it suggested a meek effort to assimilate, not cause trouble. The 2007 design could not be more confrontational if it had revolvers mounted on the fenders like one of Roy Rogers&#8217;s cars. For Tundra, three is a recurring theme. There are three bed sizes, three cabs and three engines. The standard bed is 6-foot-7; the long bed is 8-foot-2; and the short bed is 5-foot-7. There is a Regular Cab with comfortable seating for two and a surprising amount of cargo space behind the seats. The Double Cab has just enough room for four six-foot adults to be comfortable; access to the rear is through short forward-hinged doors. Last is the four-door CrewMax, imposing because the cab is so large it suggests an auditorium on wheels. Inside there is so much room it feels more like a large sport utility than a pickup. Its amazing 44.5 inches of rear legroom is almost 10 inches more than the Double Cab&#8217;s, making it entirely suitable for family transportation. A 236-horsepower 4-liter V-6 is available, but only on two-wheel drive Regular Cab and Double Cab models. With a five-speed automatic, it is rated at 17 m.p.g. in town and 20 on the highway, which is less than last year. A 4.7-liter V-8 is rated at 271 horsepower at 5,400 r.p.m. and 313 pound-feet of torque at 3,400 r.p.m. It comes with a five-speed automatic. Despite the increase in the Tundra&#8217;s size, the fuel economy estimate is unchanged from last year: 15 m.p.g. city and 18 highway for a four-wheel drive. New this year is a 5.7-liter V-8 rated at 381 horsepower at 5,600 r.p.m. and 401 pound-feet of torque at 3,600 r.p.m. It comes with a six-speed automatic. Demand for this engine &#151; more than 70 percent of new Tundras have it &#151; has been greater than expected. With four-wheel drive, this engine is rated at 14 m.p.g. city and 18 highway. I averaged 18 m.p.g. on a 239-mile Interstate cruise at 65 m.p.h. Prices on the Tundra start at $22,935 for a two-wheel drive Regular Cab. The least expensive four-wheel-drive model is a Regular Cab, at $27,125. The most expensive Tundra is $42,495: that&#8217;s the CrewMax with four-wheel drive and the 5.7-liter V-8. The Tundra&#8217;s base prices are high compared with the new Chevrolet Silverado&#8217;s. But the Tundra offers more standard equipment on base models, including life savers like an electronic stability control to deal with skids and side curtains to provide head protection in a side-impact crash. My test truck was a Double Cab in the midlevel SR5 trim. It had the standard bed, four-wheel drive and the 5.7-liter V-8. The base price was $31,805. Options included an upgraded stereo and power front seats, bringing the total to $34,648. Toyota says the design and engineering were done in the United States, so it is not surprising that the front seats are wide American-size berths.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 6, 2007 GETTING halves of two cars was not what Paulette Day expected when she bought a red 2004 Chevrolet Monte Carlo that year from a dealership near Detroit for $22,000. The car was used, but it was a &#8220;G.M. certified&#8221; car, meaning it had supposedly passed a rigorous inspection by the dealer. As General Motors says in its marketing material, buying a certified car means &#8220;the reliability of new and the affordability of used.&#8221; Not in this case. Ms. Day said she became suspicious about the car after noticing the paint did not match. After a mechanic put the car on a lift and saw the welds, Ms. Day learned that it included pieces from the front of one Monte Carlo and the rear of another, both seriously damaged in crashes. &#8220;I thought being certified, there are supposed to be so many checkpoints to make sure the car is safe,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think they skipped over all of it. They would have had to notice that.&#8221; Certified used cars have become popular over the last five years, favored by consumers worried about getting a lemon when they buy used. A guarantee from an automaker that the car checks out is peace of mind for which an increasing number of people are willing to pay extra, sometimes $2,000 or more. But some consumers are finding that certified does not protect them and some, like Ms. Day, are filing lawsuits. Robert Minton, a G.M. spokesman, said the automaker would not comment on Ms. Day&#8217;s case. Three telephone calls to the dealership, Rowan Pontiac GMC in Southgate, Mich., were not returned. Automakers said buying a certified vehicle was the next best thing to buying new and that, in general, customers have been pleased with the programs. Indeed, most consumers who buy vehicles certified by automakers say they are substantially more satisfied with their vehicles than those who bought comparable used vehicles, said Art Spinella, president of CNW Marketing Research, a firm in Bandon, Ore., that studies buying habits. Certified vehicles &#8220;pretty much matched the satisfaction numbers you see from new cars,&#8221; he said. Last year, new-car dealers sold about six million used vehicles that were one to four years old. About 1.7 million of those vehicles were certified, he said. Automakers said that more than 100 items were inspected before a vehicle could be certified. Many involve major mechanical components and the frame. However, some of the inspection items are insignificant, like checking windshield-washer fluid, said Jack Gillis, director of public affairs for the Consumer Federation of America. If problems were found, the automakers said they had to be fixed for the vehicle to be listed as certified. Certification programs, which vary from automaker to automaker, usually cover current models and the previous four or five model years. Vehicles must have relatively low mileage, often less than 60,000 miles. The automakers&#8217; provide inspection guidelines and the extended warranty that comes with the certification, for which they charge the dealer several hundred dollars. The dealers conduct the actual inspections and decide how much more to charge the buyer for a certified vehicle. On average, a certified used car costs about $2,200 more than one that is not certified, CNW found. One problem for consumers is that there are no industry standards to define what certified means. Anyone from a major new-car dealer to the owner of a small used-car lot can say a vehicle is certified. Also, most automakers allow vehicles that have been in crashes to be certified if the damage was properly repaired and did not involve damage to the frame. &#8220;So long as the damage has been repaired, most vehicles can be certified,&#8221; said Virginia Y. Calder&#243;n, a San Diego lawyer who often handles complaints about certified cars. &#8220;You always have to be concerned about that.&#8221; In some lawsuits automakers have denied responsibility by saying the dealer &#151; not the automaker &#151; certified the vehicle.

And when Joe LaMuraglia, the founder of , an informational site modeled on the likes of , told his partner he wanted to buy a Mini Cooper convertible, the boyfriend joked that he would not be seen in it because the couple “would look like such a gay cliché,” Mr. LaMuraglia said. Cars are no more straight or gay than cellphones, office chairs or weed whackers. But in recent years that truism has not stopped a perception among some motorists that certain cars can, in the right context, be statements about a driver’s sexual orientation. At a time when car makers are marketing aggressively to gay consumers and mainstream culture has become more literate about stereotypically gay tastes through television shows like “Will & Grace” and “The L Word” (on which one of the main characters, Alice, drove a Mini Cooper), it may not be surprising that some people make such assumptions about motorists based on their cars. Indeed, the extravagant displays of muscle car machismo and sensuous, high-design femininity on display this week at the New York International Auto Show at the Javits Center would seem to cry out for deconstruction along gender- and sexual-identity lines. But to some people, such stereotyping is homophobia, pure and simple. A poll seeking to determine the most gay automobiles, conducted by a South African Web site, was a topic of heated interest last December on Gizmodo, the New York-based technology blog, where one reader wrote: “Since when are cars gay or straight? We’re really polling people’s prejudices here.” Others, though, including gay theorists, say many gay motorists happily embrace certain cars as reflections of identity. “People presume you want to throw off a stereotype,” said Judith Halberstam, a lesbian who is a professor of gender studies at the University of Southern California . She drives a black Mazda 3 hatchback that she considers “butch.” But, she said, “If you are a masculine woman, you might not feel bad about it, so you might become excited about knowing how to fix your pickup, or driving a ’68 Mustang.” “Not all gays want to present an image that is normative,” she said. Ramone Johnson is a gay journalist and former Saturn engineer who compiles an annual “Top 10 Gay Cars” list for About.com, which is owned by The New York Times Company. Mr. Johnson said that “traditionally we are used to being defined by others.” Driving a stylish car can be a way of “taking control back” and saying “this is who I am,” he said. Mr. Johnson maintains that “soft lines” and a “vibrant personality” — say like those on a Volkswagen New Beetle — are typical attributes of a gay man’s car, and fashion-forward red gauges and other styling cues, for example, make the Pontiac G6 more of a gay car than its sibling, the Grand Am, because the features express a taste for freedom and fun. Neither automobile manufacturers nor dealers compile statistics on the sexual orientation of buyers. Frank Markus, who is gay and the technical director for Motor Trend magazine, said auto companies tend to associate gay consumers with higher disposable incomes since fewer have children (one reason many are free to opt for less practical cars, like two-seaters or convertibles, as well).

In a preliminary earnings report released a day ahead of its annual shareholder meeting, Volkswagen said it earned 740 million euros (slightly more than $1 billion) in the quarter, compared with 327 million euros a year earlier. Sales rose 5.1 percent, to 26.6 billion euros ($36.1 billion), from 25.3 billion euros. Operating earnings, which analysts use as a yardstick of a company’s health, rose 80 percent, to 1.08 billion euros ($1.5 billion), from 599 million euros. VW has spent nearly two years cutting 20,000 jobs from its German work force as it faces rising European and Asian competition. The company said this week that worldwide vehicle sales rose 7.9 percent in the first quarter, to 1.47 million units. Big gains in China and Eastern Europe, and a modest gain in the United States, helped offset a dip in domestic sales after Germany increased its value-added tax rate in January. VW, based in the northern city of Wolfsburg, said it expected its operating profit for all of 2007 to “probably be higher than the previous year’s operating profit” of two billion euros. In trading here Wednesday, Volkswagen shares closed up 0.6 percent, at 115.22 euros ($156.47). Last month, Porsche raised its stake in Volkswagen to 31 percent, a move it said was aimed at protecting the company from a hostile takeover. Porsche has built up its holding to become VW’s largest shareholder. A German state, Lower Saxony, owns nearly 20 percent.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 8, 2007 AT a little past midnight on a recent Sunday night in a Los Angeles suburb, Bell, the police moved to stop a weekly illegal street race that had been carving up the side streets along the Long Beach Freeway for six months. Skip to next paragraph The Vehicles Thieves Covet Police cruisers arrived and blocked dozens of cars: Acuras, Ford Mustangs and at least one right-hand-drive Honda, imported illegally from Japan and modified for racing. By the time the tire smoke cleared, the police had arrested eight people, impounded 12 cars (five with what the police said were stolen engines or transmissions) and issued dozens of citations. Participating in the joint operation were officers from 10 Southern California police agencies and one civilian: Mike Bender, one of the country’s foremost authorities on auto theft. He accompanied the mission, as he has many others over the last decade, to help the police identify stolen car parts and to train officers to recognize the connections among street racing, auto theft and insurance fraud. Mr. Bender, 51, a former special agent for the National Insurance Crime Bureau, acts as a consultant to police departments and conducts auto-theft seminars around the country. His message is that thieves have gone high-tech, so the police need to go high-tech, too. To prove the point and destroy the myth that advanced antitheft systems are impenetrable, Mr. Bender often heads out to his garage to get his hands dirty and crack security systems himself. The police contact Mr. Bender for help when their cases get technical: for instance, when thieves override the transponder immobilizer systems in most new cars. In these antitheft systems, the vehicle is designed to start only when a chip inside the owner’s key sends the proper numeric signal to the vehicle’s internal computer. The technology, and attempts to circumvent it, can bewilder longtime theft investigators. “The poor guy gets a phone call from me every other week,” said Cpl. Jeff Higbee, an investigator with the Ontario Police Department in California, who participated in the Bell operation. “And he almost always has the answers.” In addition to offering help to the police (typically without charge), Mr. Bender holds regular training seminars. One last month near San Diego was entitled, “Auto Theft in the 21st Century.” Sixty insurance agents and police investigators from around the country paid $135 each to learn about topics like what to look for when a new security system is bypassed or the techniques thieves are using to alter vehicle identification numbers on stolen vehicles. The police have traditionally kept such conversations quiet, fearing they could tip off aspiring thieves. Mr. Bender’s mission is to bring investigators into the digital age and get them to share information, just as their adversaries are doing on Web sites, message boards and forums like YouTube, where dozens of videos show off car-hacking and street-racing techniques. “I don’t think there is anything we talk about at the seminars that isn’t on the Internet, being discussed by the other side,” Mr. Bender said. “In the past, we have only been keeping information from ourselves.” Mr. Bender’s rising profile among auto- theft investigators is partly a reaction to changes in the way thieves are stealing cars. In 1991, according to the ’s National Crime Information Center, 1.7 million cars were stolen. In its latest report, for 2005, the annual toll fell to 1.2 million, thanks partly, Mr. Bender said, to improving antitheft technology. But that good news has a dark lining. Fifteen years ago, nearly every stolen automobile was recovered. Young thieves often took cars for joyrides and then abandoned them. Today, according to the F.B.I., only 62 percent of vehicles are recovered. Professional crime rings are stripping cars or shipping them overseas, and antitheft technology is not stopping them. “There’s a reason we’re not recovering them,” Mr. Bender said. “The bad guys have evolved. They are much more sophisticated.” At the heart of Mr. Bender’s expertise is a curiosity about new technology and a long history battling auto theft. He began his career in the late 1970s as a beat officer and detective in the Los Angeles and Simi Valley police departments, then pursued a childhood interest in cars and migrated to the auto-theft department. In 1991, after retiring early from the police force, he joined the National Insurance Crime Bureau, a nonprofit industry group devoted to fighting auto theft and insurance fraud. The bureau moved him to Santa Clara, Calif., in Silicon Valley, where he witnessed the arrival of street racing in that community. In 2003, Mr. Bender left the bureau and started a business, VinTrack, selling high-tech tools to help law enforcement authorities to identify stolen vehicle components. But most of his time is spent offering advice on cases and training the police. Next Article in Automobiles (37 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/automobiles/21auto.html	Toyota to Increase Imports to Meet Demand for Prius - New York Times Toyota to Increase Imports to Meet Demand for Prius Katsuaki Watanabe, Toyota president, right, and Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana at the Subaru plant Friday. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 21, 2007 LAFAYETTE, Ind., April 20 — The Toyota Motor Company will sell more imported vehicles in the United States this year, Toyota officials acknowledged Friday, even though the company has begun building Camry sedans at a Subaru plant here to replace those built in Japan. Toyota’s imports will rise because it expects a significant increase in sales for the hybrid-electric Prius, which it builds only in Japan, said James Lentz, executive vice president of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. He estimated that Toyota’s total imports would probably rise by about 25,000 this year, if Toyota meets its sales targets for the Prius. To be sure, Toyota’s production in North America is also rising as it opens new factories of its own and adds production at the Subaru plant here, where it expects to build 100,000 Camrys a year. This week, it broke ground for a plant in Mississippi, its eighth assembly plant in North America. It is building a new factory in Canada and opened a plant in Texas last fall. Even so, Toyota’s imports as a percentage of its American sales have risen in the last three years, figures criticized by some supporters of Detroit’s carmakers. In 2006, 46 percent of Toyota’s vehicles were imported from Japan compared with 38.4 percent in 2005 and 37 percent in 2004. Toyota sold 2.54 million vehicles in the United States last year, a record for the automaker, which passed DaimlerChrysler to rank third behind General Motors and the Ford Motor Company. It has forecast that its American sales will rise to 2.68 million this year. About 40,000 of those vehicles will be Camrys built at the Subaru plant, owned by Fuji Heavy Industries. Toyota bought a stake in Fuji in 2005 from General Motors and immediately began looking for arrangements involving Fuji plants and the company’s engineers. It announced the deal to build Camrys here just over a year ago, investing $230 million in the project, which will add 1,000 jobs at the plant. Fuji opened the factory in 1988 to build Subaru and Isuzu vehicles. James Doyle, president of the Level Field Institute, an organization founded by retirees of the Detroit automakers, said that he was pleased to see Toyota’s investment but that it did not compare with those by Detroit companies. Toyota accounts for 9 percent of automotive manufacturing jobs in the United States and roughly 16 percent of the vehicle market, while G.M. accounts for 29 percent of the jobs and about 24 percent of the market, Mr. Doyle said. “We lose 10 for every one job that they bring,” Mr. Doyle said. And despite the start of Camry production here, Toyota will still import 60,000 Camrys from Japan this year, Mr. Lentz said. Along with that, Toyota also expects to import about 70,000 more Priuses than in 2006, when it sold just under 107,000 in the United States. But the Prius is finding lots of company on the freighters from Japan. This year, Toyota has achieved double-digit and in some cases triple-digit sales increases for Japanese-made models like the Yaris, a subcompact car; the FJ Cruiser, an eye-catching sport utility vehicle; and the RAV-4, a small S.U.V. Sales are also climbing for two Japanese-made Lexus cars, the ES 350, considered the entry-level Lexus, and the flagship LS 460 sedan. Prius sales slumped in the final months of 2006 when some tax credits on the car were discontinued and gas prices fell. In January, Toyota placed its first incentives ever on the small hybrid-electric vehicle and started a national advertising campaign. Prius sales have set records since then, and Toyota is on track to meet its sales target. The automaker actually has more Priuses to sell because it has cut back on Camry production in Japan, Mr. Lentz said. Still, the chance to build the Camry here was a godsend for Fuji, whose production in Lafayette had dropped, said Ikuo Mori, the chief executive. “We are not so big of a company. We need a partner, and the partner used to be G.M.,” Mr. Mori said. Toyota’s investment has given Subaru workers the opportunity to learn Toyota’s production methods and to train on the state-of-the-art manufacturing equipment the company has installed here, he said. Toyota, which sent manufacturing experts from Japan and the United States to help with the start of production here, is already discovering improvements it can make in its own processes by drawing on the way Subaru builds cars.

Toyota, which sent manufacturing experts from Japan and the United States to help with the start of production here, is already discovering improvements it can make in its own processes by drawing on the way Subaru builds cars.

Says It Will Make More Vehicles and Buy More Parts in India Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: April 18, 2007 NEW DELHI, April 17 — has big plans in India. Skip to next paragraph Rick Wagoner, chief executive of General Motors, announced Tuesday in New Delhi that the company would sell the Chevrolet Spark in India. In a visit to New Delhi on Tuesday, G.M.’s chief executive, Rick Wagoner, hailed the country’s thrifty manufacturing culture and growing car market and said the company would significantly increase purchasing and production here. In an interview, Mr. Wagoner said that G.M. planned to create a “local base” in India, a move that he said would not affect United States jobs. The company also introduced a new model into the Indian market on Tuesday, a compact hatchback priced at about $7,400. Car sales in India are growing about 15 percent a year, a rate projected to continue for the next five years, with low-cost cars making up the bulk of the sales. G.M. and other big automakers, hoping to offset slumping North American operations, are increasingly looking to India. In the past, the country has generally taken a back seat to China, but a growing middle class and new manufacturing prowess have made India popular for joint ventures and investments. G.M. expects India to be the second-fastest-growing car market in the world, after China, over the next 10 years. “It’s time to redouble our efforts on our manufacturing and market presence here,” Mr. Wagoner told government ministers and auto industry executives in a conference on the Indian auto industry. Mr. Wagoner said G.M. planned to take advantage of India’s high-quality, low-cost supply base “to source more parts out of India.” In a statement issued after his presentation, Mr. Wagoner said the sourcing increase could be “as much as fivefold over the next two years.” Analysts said that might translate into G.M.’s buying as much as $1 billion worth of car parts in India annually, which would be the most spent by a foreign automaker in India. In a brief interview after the conference, Mr. Wagoner said that the increased sourcing of car parts from India would not affect United States jobs because the components in question are not made in America. He would not specify which parts would come from India in the future. Given the growth of G.M.’s manufacturing in Asia, a company base in India would provide new opportunities for Indian suppliers, he said, Indian manufacturing costs are already “extremely competitive and among the lowest in the world,” Mr. Wagoner said during the conference. That is “not just due to lower wage rates,” he said. “It is also a function of the Indian mentality that abhors waste — because people cannot afford to throw things away.” Mr. Wagoner said G.M. would more than double its production capacity in India, to 225,000 vehicles a year, by making more vehicles at its Halol factory in the state of Gujarat and building a new plant in Talegaon, Maharashtra, both in western India. India has been trying to become Asia’s low-cost car manufacturing center, offering tax breaks and other incentives. Renault and Nissan announced plans in January to work with an Indian company to build a new car plant. Local analysts and manufacturing executives say India has a quality advantage over China. “The Chinese are known to manufacture very cheap cars, but the problem is that safety and emission norms are something they don’t meet,” said Kapil Singh, an auto analyst with Brics Securities, a brokerage house in Mumbai. Indian standards are as good as any in the world, he said. G.M.’s North American operations lost $4.6 billion in 2006, including about $3.8 billion that it spent on buyouts and other one-time items. Profit margins are also weakening in China, G.M.’s second-largest market, as competition lowers car prices. The new car G.M. will sell in India, the Chevrolet Spark, will be its smallest car in India. The other two G.M. models there cost significantly more, and sales are sluggish. “G.M. has a long way to go in India,” said Mr. Singh. “They haven’t been in the mainstream car business yet.” Next Article in Automobiles (30 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Dith Pran/The New York Times Rick Zitarosa cites a hydrogen leak. The New York Times Hindenburg, three times as long as a Boeing 747, being prepared in Germany for its first test flight in 1936. It was destroyed the next year on its 63rd flight. THE May 6, 1937, crash of the Hindenburg at the Navy base here was the 20th century&#8217;s first transportation disaster captured by newsreel, audio recordings and still photos. The advancement in communications, combined with the observations of more than a thousand witnesses and survivors, is why one calamity with a relatively modest death toll permanently soiled hydrogen&#8217;s reputation. In 34 fiery seconds, hydrogen leaped from the No. 1 position on the periodic table of elements to the last thing any citizen would consider pumping into a car&#8217;s fuel tank. But was hydrogen really to blame? Over the last seven decades, countless inquiries, investigations, books, movies, television reports and Internet postings have attempted to answer that question. After weighing the evidence, Rick Zitarosa, 45, of Point Pleasant, N.J., said he thought he knew the cause of the Hindenburg&#8217;s demise. Mr. Zitarosa, a supervisor for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority , is not a scientist, engineer or lawyer. But since he read a book on the subject as a 10-year old, his passion has been the study of airships in general and the Hindenburg in particular. His colleague, Lawrence Lyford, deputy public affairs officer for the Naval Air Engineering Station here, said, &#8220;Rick Zitarosa is our resident expert on the subject of lighter-than-air service. He achieved this standing through extensive document research and numerous interviews.&#8221; Mr. Zitarosa said the ship, the German zeppelin LZ 129, was on its 63rd flight and had logged 3,000 hours of reliable service. &#8220;It was a large, complex machine, three times as long as a Boeing 747,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Its structure consisted of 12 miles of duralumin, an aircraft alloy, girders joined by over 4 million rivets and 100 miles of brace wires. The outer skin was 40 acres of cotton fabric impregnated with iron oxide, cellulose acetate butyrate and aluminum powder.&#8221; He added that the zeppelin&#8217;s 16 cells, made of gas-proof latex-treated cotton, contained seven million cubic feet of hydrogen gas capable of lifting 247,000 pounds. Four Daimler-Benz diesel engines propelled the Hindenburg to a maximum speed of 84 miles an hour. &#8220;A crew of 16 operated the ship and there were cabins inside the hull for 50 passengers,&#8221; he said. On May 6, strong Atlantic headwinds and stormy weather on the East Coast had delayed the Hindenburg&#8217;s arrival by 12 hours. Mr. Zitarosa said that Captain Max Pruss &#8220;may have been in a hurry to get the ship on the ground. During a lull in the thunderstorm activity, he made a rather tight turn during its final approach. Gas was vented to bring the ship into trim. During the last 11 minutes of the trip, the ship was tail heavy, so 2,000 pounds of water was dropped from the stern. &#8220;Electrical conditions in the atmosphere were probably a little risky. Earlier in the day, rubber factories in northern New Jersey had been closed due to static in the air; the fear was that stocks of carbon black might ignite.&#8221; The Hindenburg&#8217;s heavy tail just before landing is evidence of a loss of hydrogen, Mr. Zitarosa said, adding that there were two likely explanations for the leak: a stuck valve during maneuvering to reduce altitude or a minor structural failure caused by guy wires snapping during the aggressive turn, resulting in the puncture of a gas cell. &#8220;U.S. Navy Chief Petty Officer R. H. Ward, from his position at the top of the mooring mast, noticed fluttering in the upper-rear area of the Hindenburg&#8217;s skin,&#8221; Mr. Zitarosa said. &#8220;That had to be gas rippling in the space between the frame and the outer covering.&#8221; Another witness saw a likely ignition source. Mr. Zitarosa said a Princeton professor reported seeing a dim blue flame, like St. Elmo&#8217;s fire, the electrical discharge that sometimes occurs during thunderstorms, flickering along the ship&#8217;s backbone girder. The ship burst into flame at about 7:25 p.m. &#8220;In a nutshell, the catastrophe began with escaping hydrogen,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Air mixing with the hydrogen created a combustible mixture. Either a spark jumping from the electrically charged outer covering to the metal framework or the St. Elmo&#8217;s fire lit the mixture. A puff or pop indicating detonation was heard by several observers. &#8220;It&#8217;s important to note that the Hindenburg didn&#8217;t explode. It was consumed by rapid combustion; this is evident in photographs. Heat produced in the first burning cell raised the temperature of adjacent cells, causing hydrogen to spill out of pressure-relief valves. It took only 34 seconds for fire to engulf the entire ship.&#8221; Thirty-six people were killed. What about several sabotage theories that have been debated? &#8220;Germany had many enemies in 1937,&#8221; Mr. Zitarosa said. &#8220;After the disaster, there were thorough investigations by a very paranoid Nazi government and its notorious secret police, but no smoking gun was found.&#8221; Theorists have also pointed to hot diesel engines, leaking diesel fuel, and skin allegedly coated with rocket fuel as the cause of the accident. Mr. Zitarosa dismissed that theory, saying that the engines and fuel were in the lower half of the ship, while the fire was observed first in the upper part. Mr. Zitarosa also dismissed the incendiary paint theory proposed by a retired technician, Addison Bain, and an author, R. G. Van Treuren. The Discovery Channel&#8217;s &#8220;Mythbuster&#8221; television show rejected the paint theory after igniting three scale-model Hindenburgs. While the accident destroyed the Hindenburg, it didn&#8217;t harm the base. Seventy years later, Lakehurst is still a Navy facility. Before the Navy came to town, the property was used for World War I chemical warfare experimentation by the Army. In 1919, Navy Secretary converted the site to a Navy dirigible field to be equipped with two rigid airship hangars. Hangar No. 1, still standing, was completed two years later. The Navy commissioned rigid airships for use as long-range aerial scouts and nonrigid ships (called blimps) for training and antisubmarine work. All were filled with helium, not hydrogen. After World War II, training and maintenance continued until 1962. This year, the Navy acquired a commercial blimp that it is testing at Lakehurst. Now called Naval Air Engineering Station, Lakehurst specializes in producing aircraft carrier launch, recovery, and support equipment for planes and helicopters.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/06/automobiles/06CARF.html	It&#8217;s the Truth, but Not the Whole Truth - New York Times It’s the Truth, but Not the Whole Truth Thad Allender for the New York Times David P. Wolfe found that his used Honda had been badly damaged in an accident, which a Carfax report failed to mention. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 6, 2007 AN Ohio judge will decide on Friday whether to approve the settlement of a class-action suit against Carfax in which consumers could receive coupons worth about $20 and the lawyers representing them $566,000. The suit claims that Carfax, which sells vehicle histories to consumers worried about buying used cars, deceived customers by concealing the limits on the information it collects about crash damage. Some consumer groups oppose the settlement, saying consumers get no meaningful compensation and Carfax is not being forced to make clear in what way its information is limited. "Carfax wins the most," said Ronald Frederick of Cleveland, one of several lawyers who have filed a brief objecting to the settlement on behalf of Carfax customers and the Center for Auto Safety. William B. Federman of Oklahoma City, one of the lawyers who filed the suit and reached the agreement with Carfax, said consumers would be receiving the best possible deal because of a legal technicality that could have resulted in the court dismissing the lawsuit, which would have forced each consumer harmed by Carfax to file an individual suit. Carfax agreed to the settlement, but has denied wrongdoing. "Nowhere do we claim we have every accident," said Larry Gamache, a Carfax spokesman. "We can't even get our heads around how many accidents happen in the United States. There are a significant portion that go unreported." The suit claims that Carfax leads consumers to believe they are getting a thorough check of a vehicle's history, but Carfax did not have access to police accident reports "in almost half of the states in the United States." Indeed, in a deposition taken in 2003 by Rob Treinen, a lawyer from Albuquerque, for an unrelated suit, George C. Bounacos, Carfax's vice president for customer operations, said at that time that the company was getting police accident reports from about only half of the states. The class-action suit said Carfax did not receive reports from Alaska, Arkansas, California, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington and West Virginia. Mr. Gamache, the Carfax spokesman, said Carfax had improved its data collection since the suit was filed in 2004. "We get information contained in police accident reports from all these states," he said. As part of the proposed settlement, consumers who bought a report from Carfax before Oct. 27, 2006, when the settlement got preliminary approval by the court, would receive a coupon that provides them with two free Carfax vehicle history reports in the first year after final approval of the settlement or one free report within two years. Clarence M. Ditlow, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, an advocacy group based in Washington, said the settlement did not give consumers anything to compensate them for their problems and financial losses. One of the consumers objecting to the settlement is David P. Wolfe of Lawrence, Kan. "It is like giving me nothing." Mr. Wolfe said he bought a Honda Civic in Texas relying on a Carfax report. A Honda dealer told him later that the car had been so badly damaged in a crash it was not safe to drive. Mr. Wolfe said he did not want the coupon. Should the settlement be approved, Carfax customers who purchased reports before Oct. 27, 2006, would lose the right to sue the company, except those who have already written and asked to be excluded from the class. However, the proposed agreement does not require Carfax to notify all consumers affected by the settlement. The company only has to send e-mail messages about the settlement to customers who bought Carfax reports from Oct. 27, 2005, to Oct. 27, 2006, because Mr. Gamache said the parties agreed that notifying customers for that year was enough. Lawyers objecting to the settlement said that means most customers would not know that they had lost their right to sue the company individually. Mr. Federman also said a legal technicality could have forced the case to be argued in Virginia if there had been no settlement because the fine print in the Carfax purchase agreement says courts in Virginia, where the company is based, must be used for legal disputes. Virginia, he said, does not allow consumer class-action suits, so each Carfax customer would have had to file a suit instead of being members of the class. But the Ohio court already considered that issue, rejecting a Carfax request to move the case to Virginia courts. The judge who will rule on the settlement, Andrew D. Logan of the Court of Common Pleas for Trumbull County, said the case would be tried in Ohio. Mr. Federman said the issue was still relevant because Carfax could still appeal that decision. Carfax must "change their business model," he said, and make it clearer on its Web site, carfax.com, that there are limits to its information. If the settlement is approved, Carfax will state that its reports "may not have the complete history of every vehicle." Those who object to the settlement said Carfax should be forced to clearly list its limits state by state. "It is very misleading," said Deepak Gupta, a lawyer for the consumer group Public Citizen, who helped write the objectors' brief. "We are not saying Carfax is worthless — far from it. But people need to know what information they have and what information they don't have and whether they need to supplement Carfax with actual inspections by mechanics," he said. He said the settlement failed consumers on every crucial point. "The people the case was supposed to be brought to benefit don't get anything," he said. "The class-action system isn't going to function if these kinds of settlements are allowed to stand." Judge Logan has already given the settlement preliminary approval. If he approves the settlement, consumers eager for their Carfax coupons should not delay. Under the current plan, requests must be postmarked no later than May 27.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/automobiles/10auto.html	Magna Chairman Confirms an Offer for Chrysler - New York Times Magna Chairman Confirms an Offer for Chrysler Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 10, 2007 OTTAWA, May 9 &#151; Frank Stronach, the chairman of the auto parts maker Magna International, confirmed Wednesday that his company and Onex, a Canadian investment company, have made a bid for Chrysler, the struggling American unit of Speaking to reporters after the meeting of a horse racing and gambling company that he indirectly controls, Mr. Stronach said: &#8220;Financially, we have a very viable concept. We have major banks lined up.&#8221; He did not say how much the partnership&#8217;s bid was worth, but whatever its value, it would not require Magna to take on debt. &#8220;Keep in mind we have $2 billion of cash,&#8221; Mr. Stronach said after the meeting of the company, Magna Entertainment, in Toronto. &#8220;I would not gamble Magna away.&#8221; Speculation about a Magna-Onex bid has been circulating for several weeks. The confirmation of the offer will probably prompt shareholder questions at Magna International&#8217;s annual meeting on Thursday in Toronto. Mr. Stronach said that Onex and Magna want DaimlerChrysler to maintain a stake in the Chrysler unit, and he added that the two companies might include other partners in their bid. Chrysler is the most important customer of Magna, which is based north of Toronto in Aurora, Ontario. The companies have an unusually close relationship. Magna, for example, engineers and makes the interiors of Chrysler&#8217;s minivans and operates the paint shop at one of Chrysler&#8217;s assembly plants in Toledo. In Austria, Magna builds complete vehicles for Chrysler and other companies including BMW, the Mercedes unit of DaimlerChrysler and the Saab unit of When Magna was having financial difficulties in the 1990s, Chrysler extended both formal and informal assistance to keep the company going. Mr. Stronach said that he anticipated that DaimlerChrysler would reply to the offer within weeks. &#8220;As far as we know, we&#8217;re still part of the picture; we&#8217;re still a contender,&#8221; Mr. Stronach said. Reports have said that two private equity firms, Cerberus Capital Management and the Blackstone Group, have also made bids for Chrysler although neither company has commented on them. Tracinda, the investment vehicle of the billionaire , announced a $4.5 billion offer for Chrysler in early April. A spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, Mike Aberlich, said the company would not comment on the possible sale of Chrysler &#8220;until the process runs its course.&#8221; Onex did not respond to a request for comment. It has recently successfully acquired, revamped and taken public some aviation component plants once owned by While Magna has twice developed prototype automobiles that it hoped to produce for a fully integrated manufacturer, the company has no experience when it comes to marketing to consumers or dealing with dealers. In addition, Mr. Stronach&#8217;s corporate strategy runs somewhat contrary to that of Chrysler. His company is generally based on operating large numbers of small factories rather than the large plants that make up Chrysler. If his bid wins, Mr. Stronach suggested that Chrysler would have to cut back even more than it has previously announced. &#8220;Sometimes when you&#8217;re sick you&#8217;ve got to take some drastic measures,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What do we have to do to create a healthy patient?&#8221; Chrysler lost about $1.5 billion in 2006 and has already announced a recovery plan that includes eliminating 13,000 jobs in the United States and Canada. Magna&#8217;s net income last year was $528 million, and it employs about 82,000 people. Johannes Van Biesebroeck, a University of Toronto economist who studies the auto industry, said that Magna&#8217;s interest in Chrysler probably stemmed from its self-interest. &#8220;I&#8217;m sure for now they just want it to remain viable,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They want to be around when things are happening.&#8221; Next Article in Automobiles (12 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/04/business/04auto-web.html	G.M. Profit Down 90% From 2006 - New York Times G.M. Profit Down 90% From 2006 Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 4, 2007 DETROIT, May 3 — The Corporation reported a 90 percent decline in first-quarter profit today as losses at its finance arm overshadowed the gains from restructuring its automotive operations. G.M., which fell behind the in the first quarter to become the world’s second-largest automaker, posted net income of $62 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $602 million, or $1.06 a share, in the same period a year earlier. It was the company’s second consecutive quarterly profit, but the number was weighed down heavily by losses from subprime mortgage loans made by the General Motors Acceptance Corporation G.M., which sold a majority stake in G.M.A.C. last fall to a group of investors led by Cerberus Capital Management, recorded a net loss of $115 million from G.M.A.C. — 49 percent of the unit’s $305 million loss — compared with the venture’s earnings of $495 million in the quarter a year earlier. The G.M.A.C. divestiture led to a 16 percent decline in G.M.’s first-quarter revenue, to $43.9 billion from $52.4 billion. G.M. improved its performance considerably in North America, the focus of its turnaround effort, but remained in the red. Reductions in health care spending and reductions in marginally profitable sales to rental-car companies helped G.M. narrow its North American losses to $85 million from $251 million in the first quarter of 2006. “It’s good to see the improvement, but it’s not good to be operating at a small loss,” the chief financial officer, Frederick A. Henderson, said on a conference call with reporters and analysts this morning. “We have to continue to make significant improvements.” The loss in North America is concerning to Jonathan Steinmetz, an analyst at in New York, who had expected G.M. to instead report a $122 million profit in the region. That shortfall could signify trouble later this year if demand for vehicles softens because of high gas prices and a stumbling housing market. “G.M. is still burning cash near the peak of its product cycle,” Mr. Steinmetz wrote in a report to clients today. In 2006, G.M. cut its fixed costs in North America by $6.8 billion, largely through buyout and early retirement package offers that were accepted by about 35,000 of its hourly workers. Mr. Henderson said G.M. was on track to achieve its goal of cutting $9 billion in annual costs by the end of this year. He described the company, which reported losses of $10.4 billion in 2005 and $2 billion last year, as “operating at or close to break even.” that G.M. said were largely related to restructuring in its Europe and Asia-Pacific regions, the company earned $94 million, or 17 cents a share, well below the 87 cents a share that analysts had expected. As a result, G.M. shares were down $1.40, or 4.3 percent, to $31.04 a share at midday on the New York Stock Exchange G.M.’s stock had risen in recent days on the anticipation of a significantly improved first-quarter performance, helping drive Wall Street to record highs. But on Wednesday, analysts noted the effect of the subprime mortgage business on results at G.M.A.C., the first inkling that G.M. most likely had a disappointing quarter. G.M.’s report came a week after the reported a first-quarter loss of $282 million, compared with a loss of $1.4 billion a year earlier. Even though G.M.’s performance in the quarter was better, investors were more pleased with Ford because it improved so dramatically. The second quarter is off to a rocky start for both automakers, at least in terms of sales in the United States. Ford’s sales fell 7 percent in April, while G.M.’s were down 2 percent. “It’s fair to say the U.S. market isn’t very robust,” Rick Wagoner, the chief executive of G.M., said during an interview on CNBC, the financial news cable network, citing gas prices that have topped $3 a gallon in many parts of the country as one reason. But that is slightly less of a concern for G.M. than for Detroit’s other automakers, because G.M. now sells more than half of its vehicles abroad. Globally, G.M. increased sales 3 percent in the first quarter, to 2.26 million vehicles, but could not keep up with surging Toyota, which sold 2.35 million. G.M. had been the world’s largest automaker since 1931, save for brief periods in the 1970s and 1990s when strikes among G.M. workers allowed Ford to claim the top spot. G.M.’s biggest problem in the quarter, however, was unrelated to its core automobile business. G.M.A.C. said its mortgage division, Residential Capital, had losses of $910 million, while net income from automotive financing, insurance and other operations was $605 million, more than double the earnings those divisions generated in the first quarter of 2006. G.M.A.C. said it expected improved results from the mortgage division in the second quarter. More Articles in Business &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 13, 2007 Skip to next paragraph Alan Zale for The New York Times The solar car team from Newburgh Free Academy. Alan Zale for The New York Times Somewhat untrue to its name, Greasestock 2007 attracted a number of innovators who had gone beyond converting their vehicles to run on used fry oil. KARENA RUGGIERO, scrunched down in the cockpit of a tiny solar-powered racecar, never saw the small rock in the driveway of Peter Pratt’s Inn. But she knew it was there when the ground-scraping car — a brightly colored sliver with a wide bustle of photovoltaic cells splayed out behind — stopped dead in its tracks. So Ms. Ruggiero, a senior at the Newburgh Free Academy who had helped build the car, did what any savvy solar car racer would do: she bounced up and down in the seat to help inch the car forward. With a push from Jessica Marshall and Tova Markowitz, classmates who also helped with the car’s construction, the racecar gradually cleared the obstacle and continued on its way to the cheers of onlookers. This was Greasestock, the third annual gathering of “greasers,” people who have converted their diesel cars and trucks to run on vegetable oil. Somewhat untrue to its name, Greasestock 2007 attracted a number of innovators who had gone beyond converting their vehicles to run on used fry oil. In 2005, a tiny group — just eight committed aficionados — gathered at the invitation of Jon Pratt, the owner of the inn here in the rolling hills of northern Westchester County. By this year, attendance had grown to about 300 people, including nearly 50 who had driven converted vehicles. (I was among them, with my greased Jetta, which I have renamed Volksvegan.) Looking like a miniature county fair, the grounds of the inn were dotted with booths set up by local green businesses like ISI Solar and Choose Green Energy, two solar panel installers. But the biggest attraction for most attendees was the vehicles themselves, a collection of rather ordinary-looking Volkswagens and Mercedes-Benzes, along with a few Dodge and Ford trucks, lined up in the unpaved parking lot with their hoods raised. Brian Miller, who has driven more than 140,000 miles on used vegetable oil in his 1997 Ford F-250 pickup, made the 1,000-mile trip from his home in Peoria, Ill. “But you have to understand, I average 1,000 miles a week in my job, and it’s all on grease.” One of the more unusual cars was a bright green Austin Mini, modified with a Peugeot diesel engine and converted to run on vegetable oil. It was displayed by a Massachusetts company, Madhouse Minis. Some of the drivers had spent as little as $200 gathering up parts from hardware stores and plumbing suppliers; others had paid thousands of dollars for professional installation of components like a heated filter housing with electrically operated valves that automatically switch between tanks of diesel and vegetable oil. A crowd gathered as Wally Little, a partner in the newly formed V.O. Tech, a conversion company in nearby Mahopac, showed his filter unit, a shiny hunk of milled aluminum equipped with an electric heater to keep the normally viscous vegetable oil thin enough to pass through modern diesel injectors. At $1,250 for the custom-made device, he said, there’s barely a profit. A roaring sound drew a crowd of onlookers to a nearby oak tree, where Steve Leung was demonstrating another use for vegetable oil. On the ground in front of him were disembodied pieces of the oil-fired furnace that heats his home in Fairfield, Conn. A vigorous flame shot from the jet, showing that with the right adjustments, a furnace could be made to run on used cooking oil. “I thought of doing this last September, got it running in mid-October and heated my house all winter on vegetable oil,” Mr. Leung said. “I used about 700 gallons, and it was all free.” Mr. Pratt, who had closed his inn for the weekend to serve as host for the event, said he was happy to meet like-minded vegetable oil enthusiasts he had known only by their screen names at , an Internet meeting place established by one of the makers of conversion kits. Skip Wrightson, a customer service representative for Greasecar, the Massachusetts-based kit maker, said he saw vegetable oil conversions as a way “to establish a relationship with a car that allows people to live a modern life without doing damage to the earth.” Mr. Pratt expressed a different motive. “I run my car on grease to save money, and to not contribute to depending on foreign oil,” he said. “What it comes down to is I would just rather do it myself than depend on anyone else to provide fuel for my car.” Next Article in Automobiles (5 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

A vigorous flame shot from the jet, showing that with the right adjustments, a furnace could be made to run on used cooking oil. “I thought of doing this last September, got it running in mid-October and heated my house all winter on vegetable oil,” Mr. Leung said. “I used about 700 gallons, and it was all free.” Mr. Pratt, who had closed his inn for the weekend to serve as host for the event, said he was happy to meet like-minded vegetable oil enthusiasts he had known only by their screen names at , an Internet meeting place established by one of the makers of conversion kits. Skip Wrightson, a customer service representative for Greasecar, the Massachusetts-based kit maker, said he saw vegetable oil conversions as a way “to establish a relationship with a car that allows people to live a modern life without doing damage to the earth.” Mr. Pratt expressed a different motive. “I run my car on grease to save money, and to not contribute to depending on foreign oil,” he said. “What it comes down to is I would just rather do it myself than depend on anyone else to provide fuel for my car.” Next Article in Automobiles (5 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Alan Zale for The New York Times Somewhat untrue to its name, Greasestock 2007 attracted a number of innovators who had gone beyond converting their vehicles to run on used fry oil. KARENA RUGGIERO, scrunched down in the cockpit of a tiny solar-powered racecar, never saw the small rock in the driveway of Peter Pratt’s Inn. But she knew it was there when the ground-scraping car — a brightly colored sliver with a wide bustle of photovoltaic cells splayed out behind — stopped dead in its tracks. So Ms. Ruggiero, a senior at the Newburgh Free Academy who had helped build the car, did what any savvy solar car racer would do: she bounced up and down in the seat to help inch the car forward. With a push from Jessica Marshall and Tova Markowitz, classmates who also helped with the car’s construction, the racecar gradually cleared the obstacle and continued on its way to the cheers of onlookers. This was Greasestock, the third annual gathering of “greasers,” people who have converted their diesel cars and trucks to run on vegetable oil. Somewhat untrue to its name, Greasestock 2007 attracted a number of innovators who had gone beyond converting their vehicles to run on used fry oil. In 2005, a tiny group — just eight committed aficionados — gathered at the invitation of Jon Pratt, the owner of the inn here in the rolling hills of northern Westchester County. By this year, attendance had grown to about 300 people, including nearly 50 who had driven converted vehicles. (I was among them, with my greased Jetta, which I have renamed Volksvegan.) Looking like a miniature county fair, the grounds of the inn were dotted with booths set up by local green businesses like ISI Solar and Choose Green Energy, two solar panel installers. But the biggest attraction for most attendees was the vehicles themselves, a collection of rather ordinary-looking Volkswagens and Mercedes-Benzes, along with a few Dodge and Ford trucks, lined up in the unpaved parking lot with their hoods raised. Brian Miller, who has driven more than 140,000 miles on used vegetable oil in his 1997 Ford F-250 pickup, made the 1,000-mile trip from his home in Peoria, Ill. “But you have to understand, I average 1,000 miles a week in my job, and it’s all on grease.” One of the more unusual cars was a bright green Austin Mini, modified with a Peugeot diesel engine and converted to run on vegetable oil. It was displayed by a Massachusetts company, Madhouse Minis. Some of the drivers had spent as little as $200 gathering up parts from hardware stores and plumbing suppliers; others had paid thousands of dollars for professional installation of components like a heated filter housing with electrically operated valves that automatically switch between tanks of diesel and vegetable oil. A crowd gathered as Wally Little, a partner in the newly formed V.O. Tech, a conversion company in nearby Mahopac, showed his filter unit, a shiny hunk of milled aluminum equipped with an electric heater to keep the normally viscous vegetable oil thin enough to pass through modern diesel injectors. At $1,250 for the custom-made device, he said, there’s barely a profit. A roaring sound drew a crowd of onlookers to a nearby oak tree, where Steve Leung was demonstrating another use for vegetable oil. On the ground in front of him were disembodied pieces of the oil-fired furnace that heats his home in Fairfield, Conn. A vigorous flame shot from the jet, showing that with the right adjustments, a furnace could be made to run on used cooking oil. “I thought of doing this last September, got it running in mid-October and heated my house all winter on vegetable oil,” Mr. Leung said. “I used about 700 gallons, and it was all free.” Mr. Pratt, who had closed his inn for the weekend to serve as host for the event, said he was happy to meet like-minded vegetable oil enthusiasts he had known only by their screen names at , an Internet meeting place established by one of the makers of conversion kits. Skip Wrightson, a customer service representative for Greasecar, the Massachusetts-based kit maker, said he saw vegetable oil conversions as a way “to establish a relationship with a car that allows people to live a modern life without doing damage to the earth.” Mr. Pratt expressed a different motive. “I run my car on grease to save money, and to not contribute to depending on foreign oil,” he said. “What it comes down to is I would just rather do it myself than depend on anyone else to provide fuel for my car.” Next Article in Automobiles (5 of 41) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.
