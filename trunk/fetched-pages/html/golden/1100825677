http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7440216.html	IBM aims to make big computing greener | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Technology IBM aims to make big computing greener Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 7:55 AM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 7:55 AM PDT In a sign that environmental sensibilities are informing business strategies, IBM Corp. is spending $1 billion to spread technologies and services that could make corporate computing centers more energy efficient. Under an initiative that IBM executives intend to announce at an event Thursday in New York, the company will reoutfit the "data centers" it operates and help its customers redo their own with multiple power-saving approaches. Data centers are huge, humming banks of servers that process transactions, serve up Web pages and store information. Because of all the electricity and air conditioning those computers need, data centers can be energy hogs. IBM - which has pledged, like several other big companies, to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions - is a leading data center operator, with more than 8 million square feet of these computing warehouses worldwide. Among the ways IBM expects to make data centers greener is through heavier use of "virtualization" technologies, which let one computer handle the operations of multiple machines. IBM also plans to deploy more "provisioning software" that increases the time that servers switch to power-saving standby mode. And it expects to launch new liquid-cooling systems that capture power in off-peak times and store it for peak use. The $1 billion is being reallocated from other purposes and is not an increase in the company's investment or capital expenditure plans. Even so, IBM is expected to call this a massive effort that reflects how energy issues are a higher priority for its customers. Forrester Research analyst Christopher Mines said the initiative reflects the fact for an increasing number of companies, environmental responsibility now is "an input to business strategy rather than just being an output." "I think this is a strong effort by IBM to pull the pieces together," Mines said. "People are aware of the environmental impact of their IT (information-technology) shop, but many of them aren't doing anything about it so far. I think that's going to change."

http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7440256.html	Yahoo will close its North American online auction service | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Technology Yahoo will close its North American online auction service Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 7:57 AM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 8:04 AM PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Yahoo Inc. will close its online auction service for North America next month, signaling the Internet powerhouse's intention to focus on more profitable endeavors as it tries to snap out of a financial malaise. The Sunnyvale-based company's auctions in the United States and Canada will end June 16, although some tools will remain accessible until Oct. 29. The closure won't affect Yahoo's auction services in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan. Yahoo is retreating from North America's auction market nearly nine years after launching the service. The retrenchment coincides with Yahoo's plans to phase out its original photo service this summer in favor of a more recent offering, called Flickr, that provides more sophisticated tools for sharing pictures. The decisions to close the auction and photo services provide the latest indication that Yahoo is reassessing the value of its far-flung Web properties in an attempt to reverse a revenue slowdown that has disappointed investors. "Yahoo is continuing to align our resources to focus on core strategic priorities and deliver a superior user experience, and as part of this effort, we are re-prioritizing some products," the company said in a statement provided Wednesday. After stumbling through much of 2006, Yahoo opened the first three months of this year with an 11 percent decline in its profit. The slowdown helped spur speculation last week that Microsoft Corp. might try to buy Yahoo and forge a business partnership as both companies try to combat online search leader Google Inc. Yahoo's reshuffling mirrors some of the suggestions made last fall by one of the company's own executives, Brad Garlinghouse, who had urged the management to pull the plug on some less popular or overlapping services in a widely distributed internal memo. Garlinghouse's missive became known as the "Peanut Butter Manifesto" because it argued Yahoo had spread itself too thin. Closing the North American auction service was a "no-brainer" because Yahoo had such an insignificant market share, said Bill Tancer, general manager of global research for Hitwise, which tracks Internet trends. Yahoo attracted less than 0.2 percent of the U.S. traffic to auction sites during the week ended May 5 compared with nearly 85 percent for the longtime market leader eBay Inc., according to Hitwise. "If you can't compete in the space, it makes no sense to be there," Tancer said. By closing its auction site, Yahoo also might score points with San Jose-based eBay, one of the company's major advertising partners. Yahoo's closure of its original photo service is more risky because it actually is slightly more popular than Flickr. In the week ending May 5, the first-generation photo service attracted 6 percent of the U.S. traffic in its category compared with 4.8 percent for Flickr, Hitwise said. But Flickr tends to attract more urban consumers who tend to spend more on technology - a potentially more lucrative demographic that Yahoo apparently hopes to build upon. Yahoo is encouraging the users of its original photo service to embrace Flickr. Recognizing not everyone will want to make the leap, Yahoo is offering ways for users to transfer their photos to competing services, including Shutterfly, Photobucket, Kodak Gallery and Snapfish.

http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7417616.html	Comcast CEO shows off super fast cable modem | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Technology Comcast CEO shows off super fast cable modem Story Published: May 9, 2007 at 8:20 AM PDT Story Updated: May 9, 2007 at 8:20 AM PDT LAS VEGAS (AP) - Comcast Corp. Chief Executive Brian Roberts dazzled a cable industry audience Tuesday, showing off for the first time in public new technology that enabled a data download speed of 150 megabits per second, or roughly 25 times faster than today's standard cable modems. The cost of modems that would support the technology, called "channel bonding," is "not that dissimilar to modems today," he told The Associated Press after a demonstration at The Cable Show. It could be available "within less than a couple years," he said. The new cable technology is crucial because the industry is competing with a speedy new offering called FiOS, a TV and Internet service that Verizon Communications Inc. is selling over a new fiber-optic network. The top speed currently available through FiOS is 50 megabits per second, but the network is already capable of providing 100 Mbps and the fiber lines offer nearly unlimited potential. The technology, called DOCSIS 3.0, was developed by the cable industry's research arm, Cable Television Laboratories. It bonds together four cable lines but is capable of allowing much more capacity. The laboratory said last month it expected manufacturers to begin submitting modems for certification under the standard by the end of the year. In the presentation, ARRIS Group Inc. chief executive Robert Stanzione downloaded a 30-second, 300-megabyte television commercial in a few seconds and watched it long before a standard modem worked through an estimated download time of 16 minutes. Stanzione also downloaded the 32-volume Encyclopaedia Britannica 2007 and Merriam-Webster's visual dictionary in under four minutes, when it would have taken a standard modem three hours and 12 minutes. "If you look at what just happened, 55 million words, 100,000 articles, more than 22,000 pictures, maps and more than 400 video clips," Roberts said. "The same download on dial-up would have taken two weeks." Other cable industry executives, including Time Warner Inc. Chief Executive Richard Parsons, News Corp. President Peter Chernin and Viacom Inc. Chief Executive Philippe Dauman, cheered the demonstration during a panel afterward. Brian Dietz, spokesman for the conference host, the National Cable and Telecommunications Association, said the demonstration was the key technological advance showcased at the conference. "It's an exponential step forward and we're very excited," Roberts said. "What consumers actually do with all this speed is up to the imagination of the entrepreneurs of tomorrow."

(AP) - It took global-positioning technology for police to track down a 10-year-old boy and get him to a hospital in time for a life-saving heart transplant. John Paul May and his mother were at a university concert when officials got word that the heart was available. Sue May had a cell phone, but the volume was off. When hospital officials couldn't reach the family, they called Pennsylvania State Police for help. The trooper working the desk sent out patrols to search for the family and eventually called communications company Sprint to track May's cell phone, then sent officers to the concert at Slippery Rock College, State Police Cpl. James Green said Thursday. At the concert, Green approached the director, giving him the cut sign. The crowd was "sitting there dumbfounded," Green said. "I don't think they knew what to expect that the State Police were there stopping a concert." "I called out Sue's name twice, and the second time she raised her hand," he said. "I announced we had to get her to Pittsburgh, to the children's hospital, that they had a heart for her little boy." John, who had coronary artery disease, underwent surgery at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh on Saturday night. He was in critical but stable condition Thursday morning, his mother told CBS's "The Early Show." "He's doing as good as expected at this time, but that's just thanks to all the policemen," May said. "If it wasn't for them, if we didn't get this heart, who knows if my son would have survived to the next heart?" Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7440361.html	Long-range eye-tracker knows when you look at ads | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Technology Long-range eye-tracker knows when you look at ads Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 8:04 AM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 8:04 AM PDT TORONTO (AP) - A Canadian professor has developed technology that allows advertisers to count the number of people who look at their billboards and screens. Roel Vertegaal's Xuuk eyebox2 is a $999 portable device with a camera that monitors eye movements and automatically detects when you are looking at it from up to about 35 feet away. Until now, Vertegaal says, such eye-trackers have been ineffective beyond 2 feet, required people to remain stationary and cost more than $25,000. "It can track interest for your advertisers so you can actually have a business model where you sell the ad by the eyeball," said Vertegaal, a professor at Queens University in Kingston, Ontario. The eyebox2 comes as ads increasingly appear on plasma display panels in shopping malls, restaurants and other public places. Although Internet ads can be measured by the number of hits on a Web site, it is much harder to assess the ads on plasma screens. Vertegaal, who has been working on the technology since 1994, says advertisers can now accurately measure how much attention something receives, whether on a plasma panel, a billboard, or as the result of its placement on a supermarket shelf. Whether a viewer actually makes a purchase is another matter. Vertegaal said the eyebox2 is being used by advertisers in Britain, but not in the United States yet. He recently spoke at Google Inc.'s corporate headquarters in Mountain View, Calif. Google said in a statement that it often invites interesting people, but such talks shouldn't infer any specific product direction Google is taking.

http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7417671.html	Scientists plan Web site to catalog all life on earth | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Technology Scientists plan Web site to catalog all life on earth Story Published: May 9, 2007 at 8:24 AM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 12:23 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - In a whale-sized project, the world's scientists plan to compile everything they know about all of Earth's 1.8 million known species and put it all on one Web site, open to everyone. The effort, called the Encyclopedia of Life, will include species descriptions, pictures, maps, videos, sound, sightings by amateurs, and links to entire genomes and scientific journal papers. Its first pages of information will be shown Wednesday in Washington where the massive effort is being announced by some of the world's leading scientific institutions and universities. The project will take about 10 years to complete. "It's an interactive zoo," said James Edwards, who will be the encyclopedia's executive director. Edwards currently helps run a global biodiversity information system. If the new encyclopedia progresses as planned, it should fill about 300 million pages, which, if lined up end-to-end, would be more than 52,000 miles long, able to stretch twice around the world at the equator. The MacArthur and Sloan foundations have given a total $12.5 million to pay for the first 2½ years of the massive effort, but it will be free and accessible to everyone. The pages can be adjusted so that they provide useful information for both a schoolchild and a research biologist alike, with an emphasis on encouraging "citizen-scientists" to add their sightings. While amateurs can contribute in clearly marked side pages, the key detail and science parts of the encyclopedia will be compiled and reviewed by experts. "It could be a very big leap in the way we do science," said Cristian Samper, acting secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, one of seven museums, universities and labs to launch the encyclopedia. "This is a project that is so big, not even the Smithsonian, could do it by itself. It is a global effort." Other institutions helping head the undertaking include Harvard University, Chicago's Field Museum, the Marine Biological Laboratory in Massachusetts, the Biodiversity Heritage Library Consortium, the Missouri Botanical Garden and the Atlas of Living Australia. The project will try to be like Mexico's Conabio compilation of all 70,000 named species in that country, but bigger, Edwards said. "They are going to do something extremely ambitious and important," said Conabio's founding director Jorge Soberon, now a professor at the University of Kansas. For more than a decade scientists have tried to compile simply a list of all species on Earth, but failed. It's been too complicated, too expensive and too cumbersome. This effort may succeed where the others have faltered because of new search engine technology - the same kind that Google uses. It will scan the Web for scientific information on the Internet and "mash up" all of the material into a file that then gets reviewed by expert curators, said Harvard's James Hanken, a steering committee member. For scientists, especially those in developing countries, this can open up new worlds of research, said Samper, who has worked as a biologist in Colombia studying South American plants. And that means more science from different areas, he said. Research papers that used to limited to northern science libraries will be easily accessible in remote Botswana, he said. "The democracy of science can't be overemphasized," he added. And the democracy will be spread to people without PhDs. Edwards said the public will be able to send information to scientists that they wouldn't have otherwise. "The public can contribute, and that makes a big difference," Soberon said. "It's one thing to be a passive spectator and another when the public can contribute." This could be crucial in tracking invasive species, Samper said. Sample demonstration pages of the polar bear show what the scientists hope to do. It offers pictures, maps, research and data on the molecular biology, genetics, reproduction diet of the polar bear. The information can be accessed at the "novice" level, which says: "Polar bears inhabit Arctic sea ice, water, islands and continental coastlines." At "expert" level, it says: Polar bears occur in low numbers throughout their range and are most abundant in shallow water areas near shore or where current or upwellings increase biological productivity near ice areas associated with open water, polynyas or lead systems." And as new species are discovered each day, they'll be added, scientists say. They estimate that Earth actually has 8 million species or so, but only one-quarter of them have been identified and named as separate species. After that, long-gone species - the fossil world - will be added. "If we don't include dinosaurs, we'll have lost 6-year-old boys," Edwards said.

(AP) - The Phoenix Mars Lander, the product of scientists at the University of Arizona, has emerged from its cocoon at Florida's Kennedy Space Center following a flight from Colorado, where it was built. The spacecraft was flown to the Shuttle Landing Facility by a U.S. Air Force C-17 cargo plane. Workers used a huge crane on Tuesday to remove the top and sides of a steel container that encased the lander during the trip, said Gary Napier, spokesman with Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Littleton, Colo., Space Systems facility. They then removed two layers of an amber-colored plastic material designed to protect the lander from possible contamination during the journey, he said. The lander will undergo final preparations and testing inside the very same clean room where many earlier Mars mission craft were housed before launch, Napier said. As the Aug. 3 launch date approaches, the Phoenix Mars Lander will be integrated with a Delta II launch vehicle. The three-stage, 130-foot-tall Delta II has 12 rockets designed to push the 1,500-pound lander out of Earth's gravity. The lander is scheduled to arrive on Mars next May. The University of Arizona is in charge of the Phoenix Mars mission, with the goal of finding evidence of water and habitable conditions near the red planet's northern polar region.

http://www.komotv.com/news/tech/7461017.html	NASA study: Eastern U.S. to get hotter | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Technology NASA study: Eastern U.S. to get hotter Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 8:02 AM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 8:02 AM PDT WASHINGTON (AP) - Future eastern United States summers look much hotter than originally predicted with daily highs about 10 degrees warmer than in recent years by the mid-2080s, a new NASA study says. Previous and widely used global warming computer estimates predict too many rainy days, the study says. Because drier weather is hotter, they underestimate how warm it will be east of the Mississippi River, said atmospheric scientists Barry Lynn and Leonard Druyan of Columbia University and NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies. "Unless we take some strong action to curtail carbon dioxide emissions, it's going to get a lot hotter," said Lynn, now a scientist at Hebrew University of Jerusalem. "It's going to be a lot more dangerous for people who are not in the best of health." The study got mixed reviews from other climate scientists, in part because the eastern United States has recently been wetter and cooler than forecast. Instead of daily summer highs in the 1990s that averaged in the low to mid 80s Fahrenheit, the eastern United States is in for daily summer highs regularly in the low to mid 90s, the study found. The study only looked at the eastern United States because that was the focus of the funding by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Lynn said. And that's just the eastern United States as a whole. For individual cities, the future looks even hotter. In the 2080s, the average summer high will probably be 102 degrees in Jacksonville, 100 degrees in Memphis, 96 degrees in Atlanta, and 91 degrees in Chicago and Washington, according to the study published in the April edition of the peer-reviewed journal Climate and posted on the NASA Web site Thursday. But every now and then a summer will be drier than normal and that means even hotter days, Lynn said. So when Lynn's computer models spit out simulated results for July 2085 the forecast temperatures sizzled past uncomfortable into painful. The study showed a map where the average high in the southeast neared 115 and pushed 100 in the northeast. Even Canada flirted with the low to mid 90s. Many politicians and climate skeptics have criticized computer models as erring on the side of predicting temperatures that are too hot and outcomes that are too apocalyptic with global warming. But Druyan said the problem is most computer models, especially when compared to their predictions of past observations, underestimate how bad global warming is. That's because they see too many rainy days, which tends to cool temperatures off, he said. There is an established link between rainy and cooler weather and hot and drier weather, said Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Rainy days means more clouds blocking the sun and more solar heat used to evaporate water, Druyan said. "I'm sorry for the bad news," Druyan said. "It gets worse everywhere." Trenberth said the link between dryness and heat works, but he is a little troubled by the computer modeling done by Lynn and Druyan and points out that recently the eastern United States has been wetter and cooler than expected. A top U.S. climate modeler, Jerry Mahlman, criticized the study as not matching models up correctly and "just sort of whistling in the dark a little bit." But Andrew Weaver of the University of Victoria, editor of the journal Climate but not of this study, praised the paper, saying "it makes perfect sense." He said it shows yet another "positive feedback" in global warming, where one aspect of climate change makes something else worse and it works like a loop. "The more we start to understand of the science, the more positive feedbacks we start to find," Weaver said. Weaver said looking at the map of a hotter eastern United States he can think of one thing: "I like living in Canada." Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

Passengers can pay by credit card - no more fumbling for cash and tip. As a cab heads through Greenwich Village, for example, passengers can find ads and reviews for neighborhood bars and restaurants. They can also view news stories and an electronic map of their cab's progress. The monitors are now in 200 city cabs as an experiment, but a plan to put them in all 13,000 cabs has angered many drivers. They see the technology as an expensive imposition that would cost them money and allow taxi owners and officials to check up on them. The issue has a delicate history: A 2003 experiment with touch-screen television in taxis ended within months, amid passenger antipathy. And the drivers' group leading the opposition to the monitors notes that it carried out a crippling one-day taxi strike over other issues in 1998. The Taxi and Limousine Commission is scheduled Thursday to consider an Oct. 1 deadline for all of the city's cabs to start installing the systems. "This project is nothing short of revolutionary and evolutionary for the taxi industry," Taxi and Limousine Commissioner Matthew W. Daus wrote in a recent agency newsletter. The commission called for the technology while approving a 26 percent fare increase in 2004, and the agency argues that both riders and drivers stand to benefit. The credit-card option is expected to prove popular with customers in what is now a mostly cash, $1.8 billion-a-year business. Officials say it could translate to bigger tips and more fares from riders short on cash. The global positioning system in the technology will also automate required record-keeping and give drivers crucial information about traffic or lost items. If a customer reports losing a wallet, for example, the taxi commission could send alerts to drivers in the neighborhood where the customer was dropped off to be on the lookout. The commission has approved tests of four systems and may endorse them for sale within days. Taxi owners would choose from the four systems, at a maximum three-year cost of $7,200 for equipment and various fees, although commission officials expect the cost will be far less in many cases. Vendors say advertising can offset at least some of owners' costs. Objecting drivers have raised concerns about the costs of the hardware, credit-card fees and potential working time lost if the systems need repair. Some worry that the global-positioning system will be used to track their movements, although the taxi commission says it will record only the pickup and drop-off points and fare, which drivers already are required to log. "It's trampling on our constitutional rights, and it will cut deeply into our income," said Bill Lindauer, who drove a cab for 30 years and is a member of the organizing committee of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a drivers' advocacy group with more than 7,000 members. The alliance held a rally in March to protest the new systems, and Lindauer said this month that the group was exploring legal and political avenues for trying to block the plan. But some drivers embrace the technology, which came free for those who offered their cabs as proving grounds. Cesar Norena, a 17-year taxi driver testing a system made by Englewood, N.J.-based TaxiTech, says passengers have made liberal use of its features, and he believes the credit-card option will boost business. "People really like it," he said, "and as a driver, I really like it, too." Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

(AP) - Scientists say they now believe rotating eddies are driving Saturn's jet stream winds, not the other way around. The new view is based on images taken by the orbiting international Cassini spacecraft, which tracked the movement of cloud features on the ringed planet's southern hemisphere. Scientists initially believed eddies, or giant rotating storms, sapped energy out of the jets. ''Instead, what we find is that they are pumping energy into the jets,'' Cassini scientist Andrew Ingersoll of the California Institute of Technology said in a statement Tuesday. The findings will appear in a future issue of the journal Icarus. Jet streams are fast-moving currents that carry clouds in an eastern or western direction. By tracking the migration of clouds in images taken every 10 hours, scientists concluded the eddies were powering the jets because there were pointing in the same direction. ''The new information about how Saturn's jet streams are powered is exactly the opposite of what we thought prior to Cassini,'' said Anthony Del Genio of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. Cassini is a project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. The spacecraft is managed by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
