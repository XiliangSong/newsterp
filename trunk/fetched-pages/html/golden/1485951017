Blair Choreographs End to a Stewardship Dogged by Iraq Then, Mr. Blair set off on what seemed a first stage of a lengthy and closely-scripted goodbye tour, even as Mr. Brown, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, planned an equally busy campaign to persuade Britons of his suitability for the job of prime minister. As a first step to becoming prime minister, Mr. Brown announced his candidacy in the race for the Labor Party leadership, although it is doubtful that he will face serious opposition. Most Labor Party heavyweights who might have challenged Mr. Brown signaled their reluctance to do so in the weeks leading to Mr. Blair’s announcement on Thursday that he would step down on June 27. Two Labor left-wingers who said they would challenge Mr. Brown have failed to reach a deal on which of them should stand, apparently because of a lack of support among Labor lawmakers. Mr. Brown appeared before a crowd of cheering, youthful Labor Party supporters in central London to make his announcement today. “Today I announce that I’m a candidate to be leader of the Labor Party and to lead a new government,” he said. In a clear effort to distance himself from Mr. Blair, he promised greater government accountability, new procedures to allow parliament a voice in going to war and a greater stress on what he called “hearts and minds” alongside military efforts to combat terrorism and promote security. “Tony Blair has led our country for 10 years with distinction, with courage, with passion and with insight and in the weeks and months ahead my task is to show that I have the new ideas, the vision and the experience to earn the trust of the British people,” Mr. Brown said. “Today there are new priorities and I offer a new leadership for this new time.” Mr. Brown launched his campaign with a new slogan — “Gordon Brown for Britain” — and a personal manifesto that ranged from his views on society to his plans to visit British troops in Iraq. “Let me set out simply my core belief,” he said. “The Britain I believe in is a Britain of fairness and opportunity for all British citizens — every British citizen with every chance to make the most of themselves, every community fair to every citizen. If you work hard you are better off, if you save you are rewarded, if you play by the rules we will stand by you. “These are for me the best of British values: responsibilities required in return for rights, fairness not just for some but for all who earn it,” he said. “With the challenge of terrorism unlike anything that we have faced, the people of Britain want us strong in defense and security, succeeding not only militarily but also opening a new front, working with our allies to win the battle of hearts and minds at home and abroad,” he went on. He added: “Just as my first act as Chancellor of the Exchequer was to give away power to the Bank of England to restore trust in economic policy, so one of my first acts as Prime Minister would be to restore power to Parliament in order to build the trust of the British people in our democracy. Government must be more open and more accountable to Parliament — for example, in decisions about peace and war.” Mr. Brown continued: “In the next few weeks I will also visit our Armed Forces and the Middle East so we learn the lessons we have to learn from the last few years and we focus on the best ways to achieve lasting stability.” And he offered politics of conciliation without the star-dust that marked Mr. Blair’s early years. “I will form a government of all the talents, bringing people together, to listen, to learn and solve problems building on a broad sense of national purpose,” he said. “I do not believe politics is about celebrity,” he said. “When you put yourself forward for leadership, the country has a right to know where you come from, what you believe in and what you want to achieve. My father was a minister. For me, my parents were, and their inspiration still is, my moral compass. It’s a compass which has guided me through each stage of my life. They taught me the importance of integrity and decency, of treating people fairly and of duty to others.” “I want to lead a government humble enough to know its place, where I will always strive to be -- and that’s on people’s side,” he said. But Mr. Brown did not go into detail about foreign policy, particularly his view of the United States. Reluctant to be seen as a lame duck prime minister, Mr. Blair met at 10 Downing Street early today with Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, who praised him at a brief news conference as a “great leader” — a markedly different assessment from that of many British adversaries who criticize his decision to join the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. Mr. Blair also pledged to “still do everything I can” to work for an Israeli-Palestinian settlement. Then he planned to visit outgoing President in Paris, according to British media reports. But during the news conference, he broke away from pondering European and Middle East issues to answer a question from a reporter who wanted to know whether he would support Mr. Brown as his successor. “I am absolutely delighted to give my full support to Gordon as the next leader of the Labor Party and as Prime Minister and to endorse him fully,” Mr. Blair said. “He is an extraordinary and rare talent and it’s a tremendous thing if it’s put at the service of the nation as it now can be. He has shown, as perhaps the most successful Chancellor in our country’s history, that he’s got the strength and the experience and the judgment to make a great Prime Minister,” Mr. Blair said. “I know he’s absolutely determined to drive the modernization of the country forward in order to meet the challenges of the coming decade. I also believe that, as someone who has known him for over 20 years as a friend and a colleague, he can make a real difference to this country for the better and for the good,” he said. “I wish him well and, as I say, I’m delighted to support him and endorse him fully,” said Mr. Blair, choosing words Mr. Brown has reportedly been waiting to hear since the two men struck a leadership pact over dinner in 1994 — three years before Labor came to power.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/us/11cnd-blaze.html	Wildfire Threatens a California Resort Island - New York Times Wildfire Threatens a California Resort Island Smoke rose over Avalon on Thursday. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/nyregion/11cnd-dix.html	6 Charged in Fort Dix Plot Held Without Bail - New York Times 6 Charged in Fort Dix Plot Held Without Bail Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 CAMDEN, N.J., May 11 &#151; Six Muslim men from New Jersey and Philadelphia were charged with plotting to attack Fort Dix with automatic weapons were ordered held without bail today by a federal magistrate here. The men were arrested on Monday night after a 15-month investigation in which the and two informers who had infiltrated the group taped them training with automatic weapons in rural Pennsylvania, conducting surveillance of military bases in the Northeast, watching videos of and the 9/11 hijackers and trying to buy AK-47 assault rifles. The authorities have described the suspects as Islamic extremists and have said they represent the newest breed of threat: loosely organized domestic militants unconnected to &#151; but inspired by &#151; or other international terror groups. Prosecutors argued today that the men, all of whom were born outside the United States, should be denied bail because they posed a flight risk. Only one of the men, Mohamad Shnewer, requested bail, with his family offering to put up four properties worth $580,000 and requesting that he be placed under house arrest with an electronic monitoring bracelet. An assistant United States attorney, Stephen R. Stigall, argued that house arrest offered no protection to the public because Mr. Shnewer &#8220;was living in that same house&#8221; as the plan to attack Fort Dix was being put together. United States Magistate Joel Schneider ordered that Mr. Shnewer, along with the five others, be held without bail. They have been held in a detention center in Philadelphia since their arrest. Five of the men &#151; Mohamad Shnewer, 22; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. The sixth man, Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Troy Archie, the lawyer for the defendant Eljvir Duka, complained about the conditions under which his client is being held. Mr. Archie said that Mr. Duka &#8220;is basically just sitting in a cell in solitary&#8221; and that he had not been allowed to talk to his family. Mr. Archie also said that Mr. Duka&#8217;s request for a Koran had been ignored. The defense lawyer also raised questions about the confidential informer who prosecutors said was central to the case. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t understand how someone could infiltrate an alleged terrorist organization, and my emphasis is on allege , within 30 days of meeting them,&#8221; Mr. Archie said. He also questioned the informer&#8217;s background, which he said included a criminal record. &#8220;Everyone in the community knew him,&#8221; Mr. Archie said, &#8220;and he was bad news.&#8221; More Articles in New York Region &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph Doug Mills/The New York Times Representative Charles B. Rangel, above, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has led negotiations to complete the trade deals along with Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative. Trade Deficit Hits a Six-Month High The New York Times The unusual agreement, which came after weeks of negotiations, would guarantee workers the right to organize, ban child labor and prohibit forced labor in trading-partner countries. It would also require trading partners to enforce environmental laws already on their books and comply with several international environmental agreements. While the understanding was a victory for Democrats, it also represented a shrewd compromise by the White House. The agreement is the first major bipartisan economic deal to emerge since Democrats took control of Congress in January. It has immediate importance for four countries — — that are seeking to enter into trade pacts with the United States. But officials in Washington predicted that the agreement’s effect would go beyond those countries and could be a template for all trade deals, including a possible worldwide accord. Administration officials are hoping that the agreement will cause many Democrats to support future trade deals. They hope that enough Democrats will join with , who generally support such measures, to make passage of the agreements probable, if only narrowly. The negotiations were led on the administration side by Susan C. Schwab, the top trade envoy, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , and on the House side by Representative , Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “I think today is a recognition of the results of the November election,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. “It doesn’t mean that this paves the way for trade agreements where we have other obstacles. But where it comes down to labor standards and environment, this is enormous progress.” Ms. Schwab said that the agreement would send a message to trading partners that the United States was prepared to provide new impetus to the faltering talks for a global trade accord. Democrats have been pressing for worker, environmental and other protections on trade deals without success since President Bush took office in 2001. The absence of such protections has meant that when lawmakers passed measures that lowered trade barriers, they generally did so without the support of Democrats. In the 1990s, President was able to get only 40 percent of his fellow Democrats to endorse the North American Free Trade Agreement, and about 60 percent to support a global trade agreement. Since then, many Democrats have soured on measures to lower trade barriers. The breakthrough came as the politically sensitive trade deficit jumped in March to $63.9 billion, or 10 percent more than February’s revised deficit of $57.9 billion, putting the imbalance at its highest level in six months. The report, issued by the , followed a trend that economists have observed for months: even as growth slows in the United States, expanding economies abroad are creating a need for American exports. In March, exports totaled $126.2 billion, up $2.2 billion from February. Those gains were not enough to offset an $8.2 billion rise in imports, which totaled $190.1 billion. Thursday’s compromise affects four trade deals pending before Congress, two of them signed and two with negotiations that are nearly complete. All four countries would have to accept the provisions agreed to with the Democrats, but trade officials said they expected no major problems. Peru and Panama are considered most likely to win early Congressional approval. Colombia is more problematic, because Democrats are demanding that, besides the new measures, more protections be added to prevent violence against activists trying to organize workers. The South Korea accord, if put in place, would lead to the largest amount of increased trade. But it is opposed in its current version by Democrats who want greater access to that country’s markets for American beef, automobiles and auto parts. National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups hailed the understanding, but said they wanted to study its provisions before endorsing its details. Democrats have been most wary of two administration trade priorities: concluding the global negotiations known as the Doha round, named after the city in Qatar where the talks began six years ago; and extending Mr. Bush’s power to negotiate trade deals on which Congress gets only an up-or-down vote. This negotiating authority, known in Washington shorthand as fast track, has been vigorously opposed by Democrats, who say that they cannot imagine giving Mr. Bush open-ended negotiating authority. But Mr. Rangel said he could imagine a limited extension of such negotiating authority if the Doha round talks looked as if they were shaping up to be a good deal for the United States.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 Firefighters struggled early today to prevent a wildfire from reaching homes on the edge of Santa Catalina Island’s main town, as residents and visitors fled the resort island off the Southern California coast. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times A wildfire approached Santa Catalina Island&#146;s main city, Avalon, on Thursday. People wait to be evacuated from the town of Avalon, Calif., as smoke from a wildfire rises in the background on Santa Catalina Island. At least 160 firefighters, aided by four water-dropping helicopters and three retardant-dropping air tankers, battled flames through most of Thursday. The helicopters flew into the night and were back in the air at dawn today. Dozens of fire engines from as far away as Fresno arrived through the night aboard giant military hovercraft from the Marine Corps base at Camp Pendleton. The high-speed hovercraft can carry 60 tons of cargo over land or water, and are often used by the military on humanitarian missions. The blaze broke out Thursday afternoon on the island, which is more than 20 miles off the coast. Flames threatened the city limits of Avalon, where hundreds of people lined up at the harbor Thursday night to board ferries back to the mainland. Many covered their faces with towels and bandanas as ashes fell around them. A few homes on the island were burned, but firefighters worked to protect other properties late into the night, said Steven Hoefs, the chief of the Avalon fire department. Some 1,200 homes were under voluntary or mandatory evacuation orders. “We’re hanging in for now,” Chief Hoefs said. The blaze, which began five miles east of the island’s airport, grew to cover 4,000 acres, feeding on dry brush and scrub as winds steadily blew throughout the day and into the night on Thursday. Winds later calmed and the air grew more humid, although the threat of fire remained. An orange inferno loomed behind the quaint crescent-shaped harbor, the landmark 1929 Catalina Casino, and the homes, restaurants and tiny hotels clinging to slopes above the Avalon waterfront. A commercial building and several warehouses burned, and 175 utility customers lost electricity when power poles caught on fire. Overnight, Blackhawk and Chinook helicopters were ferrying in firefighters, 32 at a time. Crews were being positioned at the city’s edge to protect homes. “We’re on defense mode for now,” Chief Hoefs said. In Avalon, authorities used a bullhorn to urge people to evacuate the city and head to the beach. Visitors to the island were directed to the historic Art Deco-style Casino building until it lost power, while residents were sent to another site along the harbor. The Catalina Express ferry service added several night departures of 400-passenger vessels from Avalon. Hundreds of residents and visitors boarded the ferries to reach the mainland. A family of eight said they had just enough time to pack some clothes and personal papers before fleeing. “I’m scared,” said Angelica Romero, 30, holding her 7-month-old daughter. “But what’s important is I have my children. The rest doesn’t matter.” At the mainland port of Long Beach, Kathy Troeger, a Santa Catalina resident, arrived by ferry with her three children and a friend’s daughter. Her husband, a fire captain, stayed behind to help fight the blaze. “It was like a nightmare when we left,” she said. “You couldn’t breathe, and ash was falling like snow.” An evacuation center was set up at Cabrillo High School, where about 85 people had checked in, according to the Red Cross. Santa Catalina has been left parched by the same lack of rainfall that has made the Southern California mainland particularly susceptible to wildfires, like the one in Griffith Park in Los Angeles earlier this week. Firefighters were still working there today to surround what remained of the fire, which briefly chased people from adjacent homes and threatened the park’s landmark observatory and its zoo. Los Angeles officials had expected the Griffith Park fire to be fully contained by Thursday, two days after it peaked, and no visible flames remained, but fire crews were still building containment lines around the fire’s perimeter late into the night. Only 2 inches of rain have fallen on Santa Catalina since January. The island is long and fairly narrow, covering a total of 76 square miles of land area, most of it owned and kept as a preserve by the Santa Catalina Island Conservancy. various wildlife. The populated areas are served by helicopters and ferry boats from Los Angeles, Long Beach and other mainland harbors. Avalon, the main town, has a year-round population of 3,200, but swells to more than 10,000 on weekends and in the summer, according to the Catalina Island Chamber of Commerce and Visitors Bureau.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/washington/11cong.html	President Open to Benchmarks in Iraq Measure - New York Times President Open to Benchmarks in Iraq Measure Stephen Crowley/The New York Times President Bush, who visited the Pentagon, said he would agree to setting firm goals for the Iraqi government in the spending bill that is being debated in Congress. Though he had agreed to benchmarks before, Mr. Bush was unwilling to link them to financing or troop withdrawal. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 — Hours before the House approved a plan on Thursday to finance the war only through midsummer, President Bush offered his first public concession to try to resolve the impasse on war spending, acknowledging rising pressure from his own party and the public. After a briefing at the Pentagon, Mr. Bush said he had instructed , the White House chief of staff, to reach “common ground” with lawmakers of both parties over setting firm goals, or benchmarks, to measure progress in Iraq. Mr. Bush had previously insisted that he wanted about $95 billion for the military with no strings attached. “It makes sense to have benchmarks as a part of our discussion on how to go forward,” Mr. Bush said, even as he threatened to veto the House plan, approved on a 221-to-205 vote Thursday night, which would require him to seek approval in two months for the balance of the war money. Still, Congressional leaders say the plan may never reach his desk, because the Senate is likely to take a different approach. Before the vote on Thursday, House Democrats demonstrated their opposition to continuing the war when 169 of them voted for a separate plan that would have required the withdrawal of American troops to begin in 90 days, with most forces out within another six months. joined in that effort, which failed by a 255-to-171 vote. Still, the plan attracted more support than anticipated. Speaker was among those voting in favor of it. Fifty-nine Democrats, including Representative of Maryland, the majority leader, opposed the proposal along with 196 Republicans. “We finally got to vote for what we believed in,” said Representative Jim McGovern, Democrat of Massachusetts and a sponsor of the withdrawal plan. The bill approved by the House would provide $42.8 billion total, with about $30 billion directed to the war effort for the next two months. It requires the president to report by July 13 on how the Iraqi government is performing in building its military and moving toward achieving political unity. Congress would then vote a second time on whether to give the administration the remainder of the money — about $50 billion — to maintain operations in Iraq through Sept. 30 or to restrict that money to deployment. “No more,” said Mr. Hoyer, who backed the plan. “No more blank checks.” Republicans derided the Democratic approach as war on the installment plan, and they and Mr. Bush said the two-stage financing was unworkable. Once the Senate is through with its negotiations, lawmakers say, a final measure may be ready for the White House by the end of the month. Mr. Bush, who on Tuesday received a blunt assessment from Republican moderates about rising voter unrest over Iraq, acknowledged the public’s impatience with the war. But he said he could not allow political considerations like “the latest opinion poll, or how we can get our members elected” to drive his thinking. “My message to the members of Congress is, whatever your beliefs may be, let’s make sure our troops get funded, and let’s make sure politicians don’t tell our commanders how to conduct operations,” Mr. Bush said. Though Republicans voted solidly with the president, many made it clear that the administration had until September — the deadline for a progress report from Gen. , the commander in Iraq — to prove its war strategy was working. While it was Republican moderates who took their complaints directly to the president this week, others in the party expressed similar misgivings on Thursday. “There is a significant undercurrent that is looking for a reasonable way forward in Iraq,” said Representative Jeff Fortenberry, a conservative Republican of Nebraska, adding that the war is a leading concern for his constituents. “People are very conflicted in their hearts.” Several Republicans are considering bipartisan legislation aimed at changing the war’s course. Senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and of Tennessee have introduced separate proposals aimed at bringing a gradual end to the war. “We are troubled by the current policy,” Ms. Snowe said Thursday. “The White House needs to hear it.” While the White House has not opposed setting general goals for progress in Iraq, they have resisted any effort to tie financing or troop withdrawal plans to the benchmarks. On Thursday, Democrats welcomed the president’s new willingness to authorize negotiations on benchmarks but said any failure by Iraq to meet specified goals must result in penalties or they would be meaningless. “There is a recognition that things are not going well,” said Senator , Democrat of Nevada and the majority leader. “The only person who doesn’t believe there needs to be a change is the president.” The Senate hopes to consider its version of the war spending measure sometime next week, and Democrats have not made public many of their ideas. Lawmakers and senior administration officials say the most likely course is that the Senate would approve a new measure dropping the withdrawal date Mr. Bush objected to in vetoing the initial legislation but retaining other restrictions, while providing the president the ability to waive them. The White House has not been receptive in the past to proposals for such waivers. Speaking on condition of anonymity, a senior White House official disputed the notion that Mr. Bush’s agreement to consider signing a bill with specific benchmarks for the Iraqis to meet was tied to Republican complaints that more pressure be brought to bear on the Iraqi government to make faster progress toward political reconciliation. “We’ve said all along there’s going to be a compromise,” he said. The official said the president understood that if General Petraeus delivered a bad assessment of conditions in Iraq in September, it would make it hard for some Republicans to continue supporting the war. For all of the administration’s complaints about the Democratic approach, officials concede that the lawmakers’ efforts to impose a timetable for American withdrawal may at least have helped emphasize the president’s point to the Prime Minister that American patience is wearing thin and Iraq needs to act more urgently toward political reconciliation. Some White House officials privately expressed displeasure Thursday that the concerns the Republican moderates raised with the president became public. Vice President did not mince words in an interview with the Fox News Channel. “We didn’t get elected to be popular,” Mr. Cheney said. “We didn’t get elected to worry just about the fate of the Republican Party.” Some lawmakers said they had lost patience not only with the war in Iraq, but also with the continuing legislative and political conflict in Congress as the two parties maneuver over the war. “The Republicans should not be saying the Democrats don’t support the troops, nor should the Democrats be calling Republicans warmongers,” said Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri and one of the 11 moderates who met with Mr. Bush on Tuesday. “Politics have taken over, and our soldiers deserve better.” Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

The men were arrested on Monday night after a 15-month investigation in which the and two informers who had infiltrated the group taped them training with automatic weapons in rural Pennsylvania, conducting surveillance of military bases in the Northeast, watching videos of and the 9/11 hijackers and trying to buy AK-47 assault rifles. The authorities have described the suspects as Islamic extremists and have said they represent the newest breed of threat: loosely organized domestic militants unconnected to &#151; but inspired by &#151; or other international terror groups. Prosecutors argued today that the men, all of whom were born outside the United States, should be denied bail because they posed a flight risk. Only one of the men, Mohamad Shnewer, requested bail, with his family offering to put up four properties worth $580,000 and requesting that he be placed under house arrest with an electronic monitoring bracelet. An assistant United States attorney, Stephen R. Stigall, argued that house arrest offered no protection to the public because Mr. Shnewer &#8220;was living in that same house&#8221; as the plan to attack Fort Dix was being put together. United States Magistate Joel Schneider ordered that Mr. Shnewer, along with the five others, be held without bail. They have been held in a detention center in Philadelphia since their arrest. Five of the men &#151; Mohamad Shnewer, 22; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. The sixth man, Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons, an offense punishable by up to 10 years in prison. Troy Archie, the lawyer for the defendant Eljvir Duka, complained about the conditions under which his client is being held. Mr. Archie said that Mr. Duka &#8220;is basically just sitting in a cell in solitary&#8221; and that he had not been allowed to talk to his family. Mr. Archie also said that Mr. Duka&#8217;s request for a Koran had been ignored. The defense lawyer also raised questions about the confidential informer who prosecutors said was central to the case. &#8220;I just don&#8217;t understand how someone could infiltrate an alleged terrorist organization, and my emphasis is on allege , within 30 days of meeting them,&#8221; Mr. Archie said. He also questioned the informer&#8217;s background, which he said included a criminal record. &#8220;Everyone in the community knew him,&#8221; Mr. Archie said, &#8220;and he was bad news.&#8221; More Articles in New York Region &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

Skip to next paragraph Vice President Dick Cheney on board the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said, in a speech on board the U.S.S. John C. Stennis. The United States “will stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region,” he said. The aircraft carrier was about 20 miles off the coast of Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates, according to a pool report provided by journalists traveling with Mr. Cheney. Mr. Cheney traveled to the Emirates following a two-day visit to Iraq, and will be making other stops in the Middle East on his week-long trip. Mr. Cheney’s message seemed particularly pointed because, according to the pool report and the Associated Press, the president of Iran, , is scheduled to visit Abu Dhabi himself in the next few days. Mr. Cheney said today that the United States was determined, in the event of any crises in the region, to keep the sea lanes of the Gulf open. His speech to American service members on board the carrier also seemed intended to reassure them that a strong American presence would be maintained in the region for some time. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” On Thursday in Iraq, Mr. Cheney spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its nuclear program, which Iran says is peaceful, but which America and its Western allies say is intended to build weapons. The Bush administration has also expressed concerns about Iranian involvement in Iraq; officials have said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that the insurgents who assemble and placing bombs in Iraq may be getting training in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq, the A.P. noted. Today, standing in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes and a huge American flag on the hangar deck of the carrier, Mr. Cheney spoke to some 3,500 service members, according to the A.P. He sounded a hard line, saying the United States must hold firm in Iraq and confront Iran if necessary, the agency reported. His tour of the Middle East will also include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/business/11trade.html	Bush and Democrats in Accord on Trade Deals - New York Times Bush and Democrats in Accord on Trade Deals Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 — The Bush administration reached agreement on Thursday with the House speaker, , and other Democrats to attach environmental and worker protections in several pending trade accords, clearing the way for early passage of some pacts and improving prospects for others. Skip to next paragraph Doug Mills/The New York Times Representative Charles B. Rangel, above, the New York Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has led negotiations to complete the trade deals along with Susan C. Schwab, the United States trade representative. Trade Deficit Hits a Six-Month High The New York Times The unusual agreement, which came after weeks of negotiations, would guarantee workers the right to organize, ban child labor and prohibit forced labor in trading-partner countries. It would also require trading partners to enforce environmental laws already on their books and comply with several international environmental agreements. While the understanding was a victory for Democrats, it also represented a shrewd compromise by the White House. The agreement is the first major bipartisan economic deal to emerge since Democrats took control of Congress in January. It has immediate importance for four countries — — that are seeking to enter into trade pacts with the United States. But officials in Washington predicted that the agreement’s effect would go beyond those countries and could be a template for all trade deals, including a possible worldwide accord. Administration officials are hoping that the agreement will cause many Democrats to support future trade deals. They hope that enough Democrats will join with , who generally support such measures, to make passage of the agreements probable, if only narrowly. The negotiations were led on the administration side by Susan C. Schwab, the top trade envoy, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , and on the House side by Representative , Democrat of New York and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. “I think today is a recognition of the results of the November election,” Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. “It doesn’t mean that this paves the way for trade agreements where we have other obstacles. But where it comes down to labor standards and environment, this is enormous progress.” Ms. Schwab said that the agreement would send a message to trading partners that the United States was prepared to provide new impetus to the faltering talks for a global trade accord. Democrats have been pressing for worker, environmental and other protections on trade deals without success since President Bush took office in 2001. The absence of such protections has meant that when lawmakers passed measures that lowered trade barriers, they generally did so without the support of Democrats. In the 1990s, President was able to get only 40 percent of his fellow Democrats to endorse the North American Free Trade Agreement, and about 60 percent to support a global trade agreement. Since then, many Democrats have soured on measures to lower trade barriers. The breakthrough came as the politically sensitive trade deficit jumped in March to $63.9 billion, or 10 percent more than February’s revised deficit of $57.9 billion, putting the imbalance at its highest level in six months. The report, issued by the , followed a trend that economists have observed for months: even as growth slows in the United States, expanding economies abroad are creating a need for American exports. In March, exports totaled $126.2 billion, up $2.2 billion from February. Those gains were not enough to offset an $8.2 billion rise in imports, which totaled $190.1 billion. Thursday’s compromise affects four trade deals pending before Congress, two of them signed and two with negotiations that are nearly complete. All four countries would have to accept the provisions agreed to with the Democrats, but trade officials said they expected no major problems. Peru and Panama are considered most likely to win early Congressional approval. Colombia is more problematic, because Democrats are demanding that, besides the new measures, more protections be added to prevent violence against activists trying to organize workers. The South Korea accord, if put in place, would lead to the largest amount of increased trade. But it is opposed in its current version by Democrats who want greater access to that country’s markets for American beef, automobiles and auto parts. National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups hailed the understanding, but said they wanted to study its provisions before endorsing its details. Democrats have been most wary of two administration trade priorities: concluding the global negotiations known as the Doha round, named after the city in Qatar where the talks began six years ago; and extending Mr. Bush’s power to negotiate trade deals on which Congress gets only an up-or-down vote. This negotiating authority, known in Washington shorthand as fast track, has been vigorously opposed by Democrats, who say that they cannot imagine giving Mr. Bush open-ended negotiating authority. But Mr. Rangel said he could imagine a limited extension of such negotiating authority if the Doha round talks looked as if they were shaping up to be a good deal for the United States.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/world/middleeast/11cnd-cheney.html	On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran - New York Times On Carrier in Gulf, Cheney Warns Iran Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 used the setting of an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf to deliver a stern message to Iran today, warning that the United States would not allow Iran to obtain nuclear weapons or gain the upper hand in the Middle East. Skip to next paragraph Vice President Dick Cheney on board the USS John C. Stennis aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf today. “With two carrier strike groups in the Gulf, we’re sending clear messages to friends and adversaries alike,” he said, in a speech on board the U.S.S. John C. Stennis. The United States “will stand with others to prevent Iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating this region,” he said. The aircraft carrier was about 20 miles off the coast of Abu Dhabi, one of the United Arab Emirates, according to a pool report provided by journalists traveling with Mr. Cheney. Mr. Cheney traveled to the Emirates following a two-day visit to Iraq, and will be making other stops in the Middle East on his week-long trip. Mr. Cheney’s message seemed particularly pointed because, according to the pool report and the Associated Press, the president of Iran, , is scheduled to visit Abu Dhabi himself in the next few days. Mr. Cheney said today that the United States was determined, in the event of any crises in the region, to keep the sea lanes of the Gulf open. His speech to American service members on board the carrier also seemed intended to reassure them that a strong American presence would be maintained in the region for some time. “I want you to know that the American people will not support a policy of retreat,” Mr. Cheney said. “We want to complete the mission, we want to get it done right, and then we want to return home with honor.” On Thursday in Iraq, Mr. Cheney spoke to American troops stationed near ’s birthplace, Tikrit, telling them in somber tones that they still had a tough fight ahead of them. His assessment stood in stark contrast to the one he made two years ago, when he declared in an interview with CNN that the insurgency in Iraq was in its “last throes.” The United States remains at odds with Iran over its nuclear program, which Iran says is peaceful, but which America and its Western allies say is intended to build weapons. The Bush administration has also expressed concerns about Iranian involvement in Iraq; officials have said that weapons are being smuggled into Iraq from Iran and that the insurgents who assemble and placing bombs in Iraq may be getting training in Iran. The Iranian government denies sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. Mr. Cheney visited the U.S.S. John C. Stennis before, in March 2002, at a time when he was trying to build support for the invasion of Iraq, the A.P. noted. Today, standing in front of five F-18 Super Hornet warplanes and a huge American flag on the hangar deck of the carrier, Mr. Cheney spoke to some 3,500 service members, according to the A.P. He sounded a hard line, saying the United States must hold firm in Iraq and confront Iran if necessary, the agency reported. His tour of the Middle East will also include visits to Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Alissa J. Rubin contributed reporting for this article from Baghdad.
