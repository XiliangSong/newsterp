(AP) - A Pierce County jury has acquitted a man accused of having sex with the family dog. Michael Patrick McPhail, 26, of Spanaway, was found not guilty Wednesday in Pierce County Superior Court of first-degree animal cruelty. Assistant Pierce County Prosecutor Karen Watson said last fall that McPhail was the first person charged in the county under a new state law that made bestiality a felony. "I'm glad that justice was able to see it wasn't an action of my doing," McPhail said as he left the court building. He said he believes his wife made up the story because she is seeking to end their marriage. It was Jesika McPhail who contacted police and told them she'd caught her husband engaged in sexual intercourse with their pit bull, Sara, last October. Jesika McPhail was not immediately available for comment about the verdict. The case generated outrage among animal welfare advocates across the globe, many of whom called for McPhail to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Deputy Prosecutor Brian Leech, who tried the case, said he was disappointed. "Obviously, I thought the facts were more than sufficient to merit a conviction," Leech said. "The defense was able to introduce some evidence about strife in the marriage. I don't think that was supported, but apparently the jury gave it some weight." The new law, which took effect last June, was prompted by a case in which a Seattle man died after having sex with a horse. Before the law was enacted, Washington was among roughly a dozen states where bestiality had not been explicitly prohibited. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

(AP) - The guardian of a disabled Clackamas High School student has filed a federal lawsuit claiming the girl was raped in a school bathroom by a student who had previously assaulted another disabled girl. The lawsuit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court, names the North Clackamas School District, Superintendent Ron Naso, Clackamas High principal Jan Miner and teacher Angela Tucker. School district officials could not comment on the pending litigation, a spokesman said. The guardian alleges that the child, described in the suit as having "significant mental disabilities," was a student in Tucker's class when her best friend, another disabled girl, was raped by a special education student in a girls' restroom at the school in October 2004. The suit says the parents of the second girl reported the attack to school officials, who in turn "assured them and the rest of the parents" that the male student would not be allowed to be alone with any female students. They also said they would protect the boy "who did not have the capacity to understand or control his behavior," the suit said. In June 2005, the teacher sent the girl out of the "secure classroom," according to the lawsuit. No one supervised her, and, according to the suit, the male student followed her, took her into a girl's bathroom and raped her. The guardian said the child suffered physical and emotional injuries. The suit seeks up to $1 million in damages. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free! The latest news video from KOMO.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7445836.html	"If it's not handled properly it's gonna kill you" | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional "If it's not handled properly it's gonna kill you" Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 11:16 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 11:36 AM PDT SEATTLE -- Right now, 1.5 percent of all cars sold in the U.S. are hybrids, and in three years that number is expected to be six times higher. At some local dealerships they even have waiting lists for customers who want to purchase a hybrid vehicle. But what makes these cars so desirable, is also creating an extra danger. The problem starts right under the hood, where most hybrids have bright orange cables carrying high-voltage electricity between the batteries and engine. Those cables can be a hot zone for firefighters responding to collisions involving hybrids. Emergency responders have an inherently hazardous job, but the proliferation of hybrid vehicles is adding to the potential dangers they face on a daily basis. The risk of electrocution is very real. "If it's not handled properly it's gonna kill you," said Seattle firefighter Tim Clark. "You have to understand what it is you're dealing with." The combination gas-electric vehicles have up to 500 volts running through them, and can also pose a danger to passengers in a crash. When firefighters are called to high-speed collisions, they often have to cut drivers and passengers out of the mangled vehicles. But cut in the wrong place on a hybrid car before the battery is disconnected, and it could result in a lethal shock. Clark says its just one more thing they have to think about when they're rushing to save lives. "If we don't spend a couple seconds on this, we could end up wishing we had," he said. Camano Island / Stanwood Fire Chief Darin Reid said that because of the complex electrical systems found in hybrid cars, they don't always behave the same way in a crash as traditional vehicles. "You could very well have a hybrid car moving while on fire," he said. And because the hybrid's electric motor is silent, firefighters can't always tell if it's running. Reid said that if rescuers wrongly assume that the engine is off, one wrong move could launch the hybrid into drive, with the victim still inside and firefighters on or near the vehicle. Fore the last seven years, Reid has been teaching everything he knows about hybrids to Washington firefighters. There are some standard do's and don'ts, but he reminds everyone that not all hybrids are the same. The electrical systems vary from one manufacturer to another. "No company puts the wiring in the same spot," Reid said. So, many fire departments often rely on the Internet when responding to crashes involving hybrid vehicles. It's not uncommon for firefighters to call up a manufacturer's web site so they can double-check the car's emergency response guidelines. Matt Stroud, a safety instructor with Toyota, spends much of his time training firefighters on how to safely deal with a Prius at the scene of a crash. Firefighters will often take field trips to area dealerships to practice disconnecting the car's electrical system. "All hybrids, including the Prius, have a built-in safety system that's supposed to turn the car off if it's in a crash," Stroud said. But the hybrid isn't fully safe until the battery is disconnected. "You've still got a boost factor of 500 volts," Stroud said, referring to a situation when the engine has shut down, but the batteries are still sending electricity through the cables. In March, a hybrid vehicle crashed into a convenience store in Tacoma and caught fire. Firefighters extinguished the flames, but because they were worried the car was still energized, they called a local dealership to walk them through disconnecting the battery. Safety is so important to Stroud, he's writing an emergency pocket guide for firefighters -- the first of its kind. Seattle firefighters will be the first in the nation to get the guide. Reid says the risks are manageable, but that it's crucial to educate rescuers. "When seconds do count, it's a lot less scary if firefighters know what they're up against." Tim Clark doesn't think it will be much of a problem for area firefighters. "It's a challenge," he said, "but we like that kind of thing."

The blaze in the 3400 block of south 150th street was called in by neighbors just after 8 a.m. The business was closed at the time of the fire, and firefighters don't believe anyone was inside. Thick black smoke billowed out of the building and across nearby Highway 99 into the afternoon, and the plume could be seen for miles. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 7:17 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 4:09 PM PDT NORTH BEND, Wash. - Some people in North Bend who opened their hearts and wallets to a needy soldier now say they've been duped by an imposter soldier. Residents say the man introduced himself as Lt. Don Daily, and said he served two tours in Iraq. He also said his local family left him with no money and no place to live. North Bend residents say Daily wore fatigues, kept his hair cropped and had a sob story that had almost everybody fooled. He stayed in a room at the North Bend motel, where he got to know the housekeeper. That woman, Jeanine Horsfall, says the story he told her broke her heart. "He just got back from Iraq and he is going to head out soon again," she said. "And his girlfriend took all the money he sent and took off with the kids." Horsfall felt so sorry for the soldier that she gave him what takes her two weeks to earn cleaning rooms. "I felt so bad that I went to the bank, got $500 and said, 'here, this is for you, because you're a soldier,'" she said. Daily also told his story at the Sure Shot Pub, where many who felt sorry for him bought him drinks and food. "He ate like a king. Unfortunately he didn't deserve it," said Lee Stark, the manager of the North Bend motel. "It was a kick in the pants." Stark asked the church to put Daily up in his motel. And a reporter from the local paper, the Snoqualmie Valley Record, even set out to write a human interest story about him. "He answered with 'yes, sir' and 'no,sir.' That kind of thing," said the editor of the paper, Leif Nesheim. The newspaper contacted the military to check out Daily's story. "Fort Bragg, bottom line, said they hadn't heard of him and they had no clue who he was," Nesheim said. Horsfall confronted Daily, who left the motel in the middle of the night. No one has seen him since. But Melissa Morrison, one of the people who helped Daily, has received a series of text messages from him. Daily's messages state he's on his way back to Iraq and that he probably would not come back alive. "Other soldiers have got killed by friendly fire after they have talked badly about the military to the press," the message read. A day and a half later, Morrison received one last text from the same phone number. This time, the sender identified himself as a private with tragic news about Lt. Daily. "He was shot and killed three hours ago by friendly fire," the message read. Morrison waited a few hours after receiving the text message, then used a phone card and called Daily's phone number back. And the man who had supposedly been killed by friendly fire answered the phone. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7455516.html	Cops accused of bad behavior during strip club raids | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Cops accused of bad behavior during strip club raids Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 11:04 PM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 11:12 PM PDT By KOMO Staff & Seattle P-I SEATTLE - Police officers are accused of bad behavior while working undercover in local strip clubs. Police reports obtained by the Seattle P-I suggest some officers may have gone too far to stop illegal dancing by mixing business with pleasure. Eight dancers were arrested at the Déjà Vu in March for illegal dancing. More than a dozen others were arrested at Rick's in Lake City last December. During those raids, officers tried to find out whether the dancers would solicit prostitution. And those extra steps they took to find out is raising a few eyebrows. In Seattle, exotic dancers can strip nearly naked while on stage, but not off stage. It's also illegal for dancers to touch customers. But according to the police reports from the two raids, which was obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, officers did more than just watch. "I grabbed her buttocks with both hands and kept them there throughout the dance," wrote one officer. "I asked her if I could touch it," wrote another officer. "I undid my belt," wrote another. All these actions reportedly took place after the dancers allegedly broke the law by exposing their genitals or touching the officers. KOMO 4 News was declined an on-camera interview with the Seattle Police Department. But the supervisor of the department's vice unit did talk to a Seattle P-I reporter. "if you just sit there with your hands tucked at your sides, they're going to know you're a cop," Eric Sano with the Seattle Police Department Vice Unit told the newspaper. One officer paid $100 for four lap dances from the same dancer even though she allegedly broke the law after the first one. City Councilman Nick Licata chairs the Public Safety Commmittee, which oversees the police department. Licata says the reports raise questions. "Is this how the police department is spending public money?" he said. "Our officers can be much better serving the public by being visible the neighborhoods than being in some dark club some place to see if they can arrest an exotic dancer." Deja Vu's attorney Jack Burns says the officers went too far. "They are overstepping the boundary.They had 12 to 25 officers out there to try and catch eight girls," he said. Among the 22 dancers arrested during the raids, three were arrested on suspicion of prostitution.

(AP) - A preschooler who called 911 on Thursday to report "mom and daddy go bye bye" helped authorities find three young children left unattended in a home with drug paraphernalia. A 34-year-old woman, the mother of two of the children, was arrested when she showed up later after a gambling trip, Spokane police spokesman Officer Bill Hager said. The children - ages 4, 3 and 2 - were taken into custody by state Child Protective Services workers after spending as long as four hours by themselves. Jennifer K. Rigutto told authorities she had left the two boys and a girl with her ex-husband about 5 a.m. to go gambling with her boyfriend, police said. "I would never, never leave my children alone," Rigutto said. The case came to light when child protection workers called the house for a welfare check, and one of the children answered the phone, Police Lt. Darrell Toombs said. As CPS workers headed to the home, one of the children called 911 and said, "mom and daddy go bye-bye," Hager said. Rigutto was being investigated for child endangerment and possession of a controlled substance with intent to deliver, Hager said. William "Shad" Smith, 35, identified as the woman's ex-husband, was arrested Thursday evening and booked into the Spokane County Jail for investigation of three counts of second-degree child abandonment, Hager said. Police also sought the boyfriend, the father of one of the children, Hager said. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

Shoshone County sheriff's deputies gave few details, but neighbors said a distraught man had wounded his estranged wife, killed her parents and committed suicide Thursday evening. Sheriff's Sgt. Derek Dofelmire identified one of the victims as Ricky Turner. He would not identify the other two, an elderly man and woman. Dofelmire said the survivor was Rose Turner, who he said was "very lucky" to be alive. She was flown to Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., where "she has been able to provide information to our investigators," he said. More than one gun was recovered at the scene, he said. Neighbors told The Spokesman-Review of Spokane that Ricky Turner was Rose Turner's estranged husband and that he committed suicide after shooting her and her parents. The Turners had three children and her parents lived with her at the house, Julie Codoni told the newspaper. She said Ricky Turner was despondent over their divorce, which was to take effect Thursday. When Codoni talked to him Wednesday, "he was in really bad shape. He was hurting," she said. "He loved her.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7452876.html	Candy-flavored meth targets young users | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Candy-flavored meth targets young users Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 7:33 PM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 7:37 PM PDT In their quest to lure new, younger clientele, drug dealers are mixing their wares with over-the-counter pain remedies and other familiar products - even candy - and peddling them under non-threatening names. A new drug temptation has turned up in Grays Harbor County. It tastes like candy - often times like strawberry-flavored candy - but it's flavored methamphetamine. On the street, users call it "Strawberry Quick". Users and investigators say some kids as young as 11 and 12 already use meth. Now with a new evolution in meth production - meth with the coloring, look and flavor of sugar candy - they worry even younger kids will be lured by the drug. Tiffany Leal took her first hit of meth at the age of 15. A mug shot shows her battered by the drug, weighing just 98 pounds. She's clean now, speaking at a meth summit to students, some of whom cried when they heard her story. "I don't want people to cry but now I know it's making a difference," Leal said. "They're feeling what it's caused to somebody. They're seeing the truth, they're seeing the hurt." She never contended, though, with Strawberry Quick. Grays Harbor County sheriff's deputies say locals have only months before they contend with it. "It's only a matter of time," said Sgt. Ross McDowell. "It'll be here, I imagine probably by this summer." The doors of the youth meth action summit open into rural Lewis County, fertile ground for meth addiction. "Meth is major problem in Lewis County. It's connected to 80 percent of our major crime," McDowell said. "I've met 11 year olds who've done meth and still do it," Leal said. "It's just crazy. I never knew it until I saw them doing it." And there's the potential for more crime by even younger addicts hooked on Strawberry Quick. Many predict the new form will tempt younger kids and vulnerable people. "I think a lot more people will start using," Leal said. Police say the best thing to do is to talk to your kids. They say meth flavored like strawberry, blueberry or chocolate candy is still meth - addictive and potentially deadly. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7451451.html	Relatives grieve the loss of 6 Fort Lewis soldiers killed in Iraq | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Relatives grieve the loss of 6 Fort Lewis soldiers killed in Iraq Staff Sgt. Vincenzo Romeo had planned to marry his fiancee, Amanda Anderson of Tacoma, when he returned from Iraq later this year. Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 5:39 PM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 5:39 PM PDT SEATTLE (AP) - None of the six soldiers killed in one of the deadliest attacks on a Fort Lewis unit in more than two years lived to see his 30th birthday. They were members of the Army's 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, and all had entered active-duty service within the past six years. Most were serving their first tour when a homemade bomb exploded near their vehicle Sunday in Baqubah, Iraq. As the post south of Tacoma plans a memorial service Tuesday, relatives of the soldiers recalled the fallen sons, brothers and fiances they had hoped to see come home in October. At 28, Joel Lewis was the oldest of the six soldiers and serving his first tour in Iraq. Sgt. Lewis stood 6-foot-6 and attracted friends easily with his broad smile and infectious laughter, said his mother, Gale Poindexter. "He exuded a warmth. He wasn't intimidating," Poindexter said in a telephone call Thursday from her home in Tulsa, Okla. Lewis, of Sandia Park, N.M., was charismatic and loved the outdoors, taking enjoyment in hockey, skydiving and snowboarding. His mother said he joined the Army in June 2001, likely for adventure and travel. "He just would never be a 9-to-5, desk kind of guy," said Poindexter, who plans for her son to be buried at Tahoma National Cemetery in Kent. Staff Sgt. Vincenzo Romeo had planned to marry his fiancee, Amanda Anderson of Tacoma, when he returned from Iraq later this year. "Enzo," as loved ones called him, was a "kind and courageous person who brought joy and laughter to all around him," his family said in a statement. Romeo, 23, of Lodi, N.J., was born in Calabria, Italy, and came to the United States with his family in 1986. He joined the military in March 2003 and by November of that year had deployed with the 3rd Brigade for his first mission to Iraq. This latest tour was Romeo's second to Iraq, one that was extended by three months in an effort to bolster troop levels in the country. "Enzo, our hearts are broken and our lives will never be the same without you," relatives said. "We love and miss you always." Jason Harkins also was serving for a second time in Iraq. The 25-year-old sergeant from Clarksville, Ga., first joined the Army Reserves in 1999, then volunteered for active duty in December 2002. A true "country boy," Harkins enjoyed returning to his hometown to fish and spend time with his family, wife Emily said in a statement. "He found the best in every situation and could always make those around him laugh," Emily said. "He was also a very loving man, who cared deeply for people and looked forward to one day being a father." Cpl. Matthew Alexander, 21, enlisted in the Army after graduating from Gretna High School in Nebraska in 2004. He reported to Fort Lewis in December 2004 and eventually was assigned to the 3rd Brigade's 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Division. This was the first deployment for Alexander, whose wife, Kara, said he "was the most gracious man I knew." "He made it his life's work to take care of those he loved," she said in a statement. The young soldier "fought for a cause he believed in, and on May 6, 2007, died for a country he loved," she said. "Matt truly was our angel on Earth. He will be greatly missed." Anthony Bradshaw's older brother was already in the military when he decided to enlist in the Army in August 2004. The 21-year-old reported for training at Fort Benning, Ga., then was assigned to Fort Lewis. Less than two years later, in June 2006, Cpl. Bradshaw left for his first deployment. His cousin, Andrea Shea, told KTSM Television in El Paso, Texas, that it was hard learning of the young man's death. "You don't believe it. You just want to know what happened," Shea said. Cpl. Michael Pursel was 19 when he died, the youngest of the six soldiers killed when the homemade bomb exploded near their vehicle. Pursel moved to Lacey in 1998, when his father was reassigned from Germany to Fort Lewis. His mother, Terry Dutcher, is a captain in the Air Force Reserve who lives in Hooper, Utah. Dutcher was not immediately available for comment Thursday. A woman answering Dutcher's cell phone and who identified herself as Pursel's grandmother said joining the military was his dream. "Michael's wanted to join the Army since he was 2 years old," she said. "As soon as he got out of high school he joined." Pursel enlisted in April of last year. He'd been in Iraq just over a month when he died. "Michael was doing what he always wanted to do," Dutcher told The Olympian newspaper of Olympia. "In light of how it turned out, I know Michael was happy. I just take peace in that right now." Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7454856.html	Jury acquits Spanaway man of bestiality charge | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Jury acquits Spanaway man of bestiality charge Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 10:46 PM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 10:46 PM PDT TACOMA, Wash. (AP) - A Pierce County jury has acquitted a man accused of having sex with the family dog. Michael Patrick McPhail, 26, of Spanaway, was found not guilty Wednesday in Pierce County Superior Court of first-degree animal cruelty. Assistant Pierce County Prosecutor Karen Watson said last fall that McPhail was the first person charged in the county under a new state law that made bestiality a felony. "I'm glad that justice was able to see it wasn't an action of my doing," McPhail said as he left the court building. He said he believes his wife made up the story because she is seeking to end their marriage. It was Jesika McPhail who contacted police and told them she'd caught her husband engaged in sexual intercourse with their pit bull, Sara, last October. Jesika McPhail was not immediately available for comment about the verdict. The case generated outrage among animal welfare advocates across the globe, many of whom called for McPhail to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Deputy Prosecutor Brian Leech, who tried the case, said he was disappointed. "Obviously, I thought the facts were more than sufficient to merit a conviction," Leech said. "The defense was able to introduce some evidence about strife in the marriage. I don't think that was supported, but apparently the jury gave it some weight." The new law, which took effect last June, was prompted by a case in which a Seattle man died after having sex with a horse. Before the law was enacted, Washington was among roughly a dozen states where bestiality had not been explicitly prohibited. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

Trooper Jeff Merrill said the tire came off of a northbound semi, bounced over the median and struck the windshield of a southbound van. A 31-year-old Bothell man riding in the passenger seat of the van was killed instantly. The driver was very shaken but was not seriously injured. Merrill said the wheels weighed several hundred pounds. "There were two tires with some metal axel pieces attached to it." "Given the size and the velocity and the weight of that object, it has the ability to do tremendous damage, as it did here today," he said. The inside lanes of both northbound and southbound I-5 are closed near the Duwamish Curve just south of Seattle. Merrill said troopers stopped the semi one exit north of the accident scene, and the driver was cooperating with investigators. He was not injured. Video from AIR 4 showed a large tire missing from an empty trailer being towed by the semi truck. The truck is used to haul large garbage containers, but it was just pulling the trailer at the time of the accident. Merrill said it is very rare for a set of wheels to come off a large truck. "It doesn't happen a lot, but when it does it's very damaging." Investigators were trying to determine what caused the wheels to come loose. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7445836.html	"If it's not handled properly it's gonna kill you" | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional "If it's not handled properly it's gonna kill you" Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 11:16 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 11:36 AM PDT SEATTLE -- Right now, 1.5 percent of all cars sold in the U.S. are hybrids, and in three years that number is expected to be six times higher. At some local dealerships they even have waiting lists for customers who want to purchase a hybrid vehicle. But what makes these cars so desirable, is also creating an extra danger. The problem starts right under the hood, where most hybrids have bright orange cables carrying high-voltage electricity between the batteries and engine. Those cables can be a hot zone for firefighters responding to collisions involving hybrids. Emergency responders have an inherently hazardous job, but the proliferation of hybrid vehicles is adding to the potential dangers they face on a daily basis. The risk of electrocution is very real. "If it's not handled properly it's gonna kill you," said Seattle firefighter Tim Clark. "You have to understand what it is you're dealing with." The combination gas-electric vehicles have up to 500 volts running through them, and can also pose a danger to passengers in a crash. When firefighters are called to high-speed collisions, they often have to cut drivers and passengers out of the mangled vehicles. But cut in the wrong place on a hybrid car before the battery is disconnected, and it could result in a lethal shock. Clark says its just one more thing they have to think about when they're rushing to save lives. "If we don't spend a couple seconds on this, we could end up wishing we had," he said. Camano Island / Stanwood Fire Chief Darin Reid said that because of the complex electrical systems found in hybrid cars, they don't always behave the same way in a crash as traditional vehicles. "You could very well have a hybrid car moving while on fire," he said. And because the hybrid's electric motor is silent, firefighters can't always tell if it's running. Reid said that if rescuers wrongly assume that the engine is off, one wrong move could launch the hybrid into drive, with the victim still inside and firefighters on or near the vehicle. Fore the last seven years, Reid has been teaching everything he knows about hybrids to Washington firefighters. There are some standard do's and don'ts, but he reminds everyone that not all hybrids are the same. The electrical systems vary from one manufacturer to another. "No company puts the wiring in the same spot," Reid said. So, many fire departments often rely on the Internet when responding to crashes involving hybrid vehicles. It's not uncommon for firefighters to call up a manufacturer's web site so they can double-check the car's emergency response guidelines. Matt Stroud, a safety instructor with Toyota, spends much of his time training firefighters on how to safely deal with a Prius at the scene of a crash. Firefighters will often take field trips to area dealerships to practice disconnecting the car's electrical system. "All hybrids, including the Prius, have a built-in safety system that's supposed to turn the car off if it's in a crash," Stroud said. But the hybrid isn't fully safe until the battery is disconnected. "You've still got a boost factor of 500 volts," Stroud said, referring to a situation when the engine has shut down, but the batteries are still sending electricity through the cables. In March, a hybrid vehicle crashed into a convenience store in Tacoma and caught fire. Firefighters extinguished the flames, but because they were worried the car was still energized, they called a local dealership to walk them through disconnecting the battery. Safety is so important to Stroud, he's writing an emergency pocket guide for firefighters -- the first of its kind. Seattle firefighters will be the first in the nation to get the guide. Reid says the risks are manageable, but that it's crucial to educate rescuers. "When seconds do count, it's a lot less scary if firefighters know what they're up against." Tim Clark doesn't think it will be much of a problem for area firefighters. "It's a challenge," he said, "but we like that kind of thing."

Thick black smoke billowed out of the building and across nearby Highway 99 into the afternoon, and the plume could be seen for miles. The cause of the fire is under investigation.

Police reports obtained by the Seattle P-I suggest some officers may have gone too far to stop illegal dancing by mixing business with pleasure. Eight dancers were arrested at the Déjà Vu in March for illegal dancing. More than a dozen others were arrested at Rick's in Lake City last December. During those raids, officers tried to find out whether the dancers would solicit prostitution. And those extra steps they took to find out is raising a few eyebrows. In Seattle, exotic dancers can strip nearly naked while on stage, but not off stage. It's also illegal for dancers to touch customers. But according to the police reports from the two raids, which was obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, officers did more than just watch. "I grabbed her buttocks with both hands and kept them there throughout the dance," wrote one officer. "I asked her if I could touch it," wrote another officer. "I undid my belt," wrote another. All these actions reportedly took place after the dancers allegedly broke the law by exposing their genitals or touching the officers. KOMO 4 News was declined an on-camera interview with the Seattle Police Department. But the supervisor of the department's vice unit did talk to a Seattle P-I reporter. "if you just sit there with your hands tucked at your sides, they're going to know you're a cop," Eric Sano with the Seattle Police Department Vice Unit told the newspaper. One officer paid $100 for four lap dances from the same dancer even though she allegedly broke the law after the first one. City Councilman Nick Licata chairs the Public Safety Commmittee, which oversees the police department. Licata says the reports raise questions. "Is this how the police department is spending public money?" he said. "Our officers can be much better serving the public by being visible the neighborhoods than being in some dark club some place to see if they can arrest an exotic dancer." Deja Vu's attorney Jack Burns says the officers went too far. "They are overstepping the boundary.They had 12 to 25 officers out there to try and catch eight girls," he said. Among the 22 dancers arrested during the raids, three were arrested on suspicion of prostitution.

Shoshone County sheriff's deputies gave few details, but neighbors said a distraught man had wounded his estranged wife, killed her parents and committed suicide Thursday evening. Sheriff's Sgt. Derek Dofelmire identified one of the victims as Ricky Turner. He would not identify the other two, an elderly man and woman. Dofelmire said the survivor was Rose Turner, who he said was "very lucky" to be alive. She was flown to Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., where "she has been able to provide information to our investigators," he said. More than one gun was recovered at the scene, he said. Neighbors told The Spokesman-Review of Spokane that Ricky Turner was Rose Turner's estranged husband and that he committed suicide after shooting her and her parents. The Turners had three children and her parents lived with her at the house, Julie Codoni told the newspaper. She said Ricky Turner was despondent over their divorce, which was to take effect Thursday. When Codoni talked to him Wednesday, "he was in really bad shape. He was hurting," she said. "He loved her.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7468872.html	Investigators: Flawed design caused crane collapse | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Investigators: Flawed design caused crane collapse Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 3:34 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 3:48 PM PDT BELLEVUE, Wash. -- The state Department of Labor and Industries says a six-month investigation into a fatal tower-crane collapse in Bellevue on November 16th has determined a flawed engineering design was the cause of the accident. L&I said Friday that the engineered foundation was designed to withstand only about one-fourth of the pressures that the 210-foot tower crane actually required. The foundation was by Magnusson Klemencic Associates of Seattle. Investigators said the crane operator was well experienced and was operating the crane properly. Steve Cant, assistant director for L&I's Division of Occupational Safety and Health, said the inadequate design of the tower-crane base clearly led to the collapse of the structure. The problem was compounded by the failure of the general contractor to maintain and inspect the crane base in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications. The tower-crane accident killed 31-year-old Matthew Ammon, a Microsoft lawyer who was in his fourth-floor condominium when the crane collapsed onto his building.

Vincenzo Romeo had planned to marry his fiancee, Amanda Anderson of Tacoma, when he returned from Iraq later this year. Story Published: May 10, 2007 at 5:39 PM PDT Story Updated: May 10, 2007 at 5:39 PM PDT SEATTLE (AP) - None of the six soldiers killed in one of the deadliest attacks on a Fort Lewis unit in more than two years lived to see his 30th birthday. They were members of the Army's 3rd Brigade, 2nd Infantry Division, and all had entered active-duty service within the past six years. Most were serving their first tour when a homemade bomb exploded near their vehicle Sunday in Baqubah, Iraq. As the post south of Tacoma plans a memorial service Tuesday, relatives of the soldiers recalled the fallen sons, brothers and fiances they had hoped to see come home in October. At 28, Joel Lewis was the oldest of the six soldiers and serving his first tour in Iraq. Sgt. Lewis stood 6-foot-6 and attracted friends easily with his broad smile and infectious laughter, said his mother, Gale Poindexter. "He exuded a warmth. He wasn't intimidating," Poindexter said in a telephone call Thursday from her home in Tulsa, Okla. Lewis, of Sandia Park, N.M., was charismatic and loved the outdoors, taking enjoyment in hockey, skydiving and snowboarding. His mother said he joined the Army in June 2001, likely for adventure and travel. "He just would never be a 9-to-5, desk kind of guy," said Poindexter, who plans for her son to be buried at Tahoma National Cemetery in Kent. Staff Sgt. Vincenzo Romeo had planned to marry his fiancee, Amanda Anderson of Tacoma, when he returned from Iraq later this year. "Enzo," as loved ones called him, was a "kind and courageous person who brought joy and laughter to all around him," his family said in a statement. Romeo, 23, of Lodi, N.J., was born in Calabria, Italy, and came to the United States with his family in 1986. He joined the military in March 2003 and by November of that year had deployed with the 3rd Brigade for his first mission to Iraq. This latest tour was Romeo's second to Iraq, one that was extended by three months in an effort to bolster troop levels in the country. "Enzo, our hearts are broken and our lives will never be the same without you," relatives said. "We love and miss you always." Jason Harkins also was serving for a second time in Iraq. The 25-year-old sergeant from Clarksville, Ga., first joined the Army Reserves in 1999, then volunteered for active duty in December 2002. A true "country boy," Harkins enjoyed returning to his hometown to fish and spend time with his family, wife Emily said in a statement. "He found the best in every situation and could always make those around him laugh," Emily said. "He was also a very loving man, who cared deeply for people and looked forward to one day being a father." Cpl. Matthew Alexander, 21, enlisted in the Army after graduating from Gretna High School in Nebraska in 2004. He reported to Fort Lewis in December 2004 and eventually was assigned to the 3rd Brigade's 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Division. This was the first deployment for Alexander, whose wife, Kara, said he "was the most gracious man I knew." "He made it his life's work to take care of those he loved," she said in a statement. The young soldier "fought for a cause he believed in, and on May 6, 2007, died for a country he loved," she said. "Matt truly was our angel on Earth. He will be greatly missed." Anthony Bradshaw's older brother was already in the military when he decided to enlist in the Army in August 2004. The 21-year-old reported for training at Fort Benning, Ga., then was assigned to Fort Lewis. Less than two years later, in June 2006, Cpl. Bradshaw left for his first deployment. His cousin, Andrea Shea, told KTSM Television in El Paso, Texas, that it was hard learning of the young man's death. "You don't believe it. You just want to know what happened," Shea said. Cpl. Michael Pursel was 19 when he died, the youngest of the six soldiers killed when the homemade bomb exploded near their vehicle. Pursel moved to Lacey in 1998, when his father was reassigned from Germany to Fort Lewis. His mother, Terry Dutcher, is a captain in the Air Force Reserve who lives in Hooper, Utah. Dutcher was not immediately available for comment Thursday. A woman answering Dutcher's cell phone and who identified herself as Pursel's grandmother said joining the military was his dream. "Michael's wanted to join the Army since he was 2 years old," she said. "As soon as he got out of high school he joined." Pursel enlisted in April of last year. He'd been in Iraq just over a month when he died. "Michael was doing what he always wanted to do," Dutcher told The Olympian newspaper of Olympia. "In light of how it turned out, I know Michael was happy. I just take peace in that right now." Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 2:49 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 2:49 PM PDT OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - Governor Gregoire on Friday signed the bill known as Sirita's Law. It requires background checks or a court hearing on parents accused of abuse or neglect before a foster child is returned to their home. The law is named for 4-year-old Sirita Sotelo, who was beaten to death two years ago in Lake Stevens by her stepmother. The girl had been in foster care before her father was awarded custody. Gregoire signed several other laws relating to foster children. One requires the Department of Social and Health Services to provide courts with information about injuries, drugs or domestic violence before a child is returned to a parent. It's called the Rafael Gomez Act, after a two-year-old Ephrata boy who was killed in after being returned to his mother from foster care. The mother was convicted of homicide by abuse.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7465337.html	Local man at center of search for millions of dollars | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Local man at center of search for millions of dollars Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 11:19 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 11:26 PM PDT At first, Darrel Kempf's disappearance looked like a mob hit, with millions of dollars missing. Now investigators know the truth -- it was an elaborate scam fueled by greed and deception. But there's still a mystery: what caused Darrel Kempf to fake his own death? And what happened to all those millions? Both just vanished, leaving behind a trail littered with hundreds of local victims. "I was in shock." "He obviously did this with malice in his heart." Those the words of some of the many victims. When Darrel Kempf disappeared he left chaos, confusion and desperation behind. "How could somebody do this to their family?" asks Jessica Kempf, Darrel niece. She also lost thousands of dollars in dealings with her uncle. For 11 years, Kempf ran a prosperous, law-abiding car dealership - Triad Marketing - from a lot in Pierce County. Kempf relied on his low-key charm for referrals and repeat customers. "I was like 'this is a good guy,' " is what one customer originally thought. But in late January, Darrel Kempf's elaborate house of cards came tumbling down. "He intended to defraud people," said Bill Wright, head of dealer enforcement with the state Department of Licensing. "He intended to get as much money as he possibly could and obviously disappear with it." Kempf's minivan ran off the road on a remote stretch of road in rural Pacific County. Investigators found no blood, no body, and no sign of Kempf. Tow operator Maynard Barnum found a belt tied to the steering wheel when he brought the vehicle back up to the road. He figured out what investigators now freely admit. "When this baby went off into the rocks, there was no one in it," he said. Kempf just disappeared. And he took millions of dollars with him. This is how investigators say the scam worked: First, someone brings their car to Triad to sell on consignment. Kempf would use that car's title as collateral to get a loan from a finance company. Then he'd sell the car to someone else, pocket all the cash and disappear. That left the original owner, the finance company and the car buyer without their money and all fighting over the same car. It happened dozens of times, and hundreds of victims are paying the price. Including his own family. "Just over $70,000," Jessica Kempf said while outlining the amount of money they have at risk because of Darrel. Jessica and Gabe Kempf gave their uncle Darrel a custom truck as a trade-in on a Honda Pilot. They also wanted him to sell their older Honda Accord. Instead, Jessica Kempf says, Darrel forged their signatures. "This is the forged title to the Accord," she said while holding up the piece of paper with signatures that don't look anything like their own. Kempf took out loans on both their Hondas. And the truck, like Darrel, vanished. Their insurance company reported it stolen. "The worst thing you can imagine," said Jessica. "It's your worst nightmare." Unbeknownst to Jessica and Gabe, Kevin Sakai of Gig Harbor paid Darrel $32,000 for their truck. "It seemed like a totally legit thing," he said. You can imagine Sakai's surprise when a Sheriff's deputy pulled him over, guns drawn. "Next thing I hear, 'let me see your hands!'" The deputy made Sakai kneel on the ground with his hands on his head and wanted to know why he was driving a stolen truck. "I had the adrenaline shakes," Sakai said. "I was just like, couldn't believe it was going on." Even Kempf's own parents are victims. One of those finance companies repossessed their Subaru wagon they'd purchased through Darrel. "As the days go by I get more angry about it," says Sakai, "just thinking about this guy and how he just screwed everybody." The Department of Licensing is trying to negotiate solutions between dozens of victims who all "own" the same car. "We've got two harmed people," says Wright. "The difficult thing is what can we do for them? We can't make anyone whole." So where is Darrel Kempf? Until the scam unravelled he lived a seemingly blameless existence. "Darrel had no history of anything up until this point," said National Insurance Crime Bureau Agent Dale Zlock. Zlock began investigating and helping local law enforcement when complaints began rolling in. Hidden in all the mess, there is one tiny clue as to Kempf's motive. Investigators discovered that he took out a loan for breast enhancement surgery for a woman who also used to help Kempf with his car business. Investigators can't find her either. "I wish I knew where he was," says Wright, "but I don't think anybody knows where he is." "From what we understand," adds Agent Zlock, "he does have a Bolivian passport and is quite fluent in Spanish." It turns out Kempf's parents were missionaries in Bolivia. He was born and went to school and grew up there. Investigators think he's probably fled the country, and they've alerted Interpol. But in spite of his connections in South America, Kempf still has ties here, including a granddaughter. "His family is here, his family is in this country, it's in this state. He will probably come back," said Zlock, who has faith that eventually they will catch him. "He won't stay gone forever." Detectives from Pierce County and the National Insurance Crime Bureau met Friday with prosecutors. They tell KOMO 4 Problem Solvers they hope to file forgery charges against Kempf soon. There could be hundreds of people out there who may not yet realize they are victims of Kempf's scam. The Department of Licensing says the victims may not find out until they try to renew their license tabs and suddenly realize they're not the registered owners of the vehicles.

On Friday in the Valley High neighborhood near Blewett Pass, the Department of Natural Resources taught homeowners how to take the fuel away from their doorstep. A raging wildfire could consume a house in minutes. That's why it's so important to clean up underbrush and simply get it out of the way. But getting homeowners to do it before the fire season starts is tough. "Right now everything is green and they aren't really into it. Or it's a recreational piece of property and they come over here to play," said Matt Eberlein of the Department of Natural Resources. Eberlein has seen just how fast a fire can move. "It could be from the top of this mountain down here in a half an hour easily," said Eberlein. Kimiko Nalle and her family have done the work. "We have...a lot of the trees and the forest behind the house and since we've been here we've been threatened by fire a few times," said Nalle. She's worried about all the new construction around her, a lot of which will become vacation homes for people living in Seattle. Firefighters advise clearing brush at least 30 feet around your home.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7471782.html	Imposter soldier also a level-three sex offender | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Imposter soldier also a level-three sex offender This photo taken in April shows the man who claimed to be an Army soldier (Snoqualmie Valley Record). Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 6:49 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 11:06 PM PDT KITSAP COUNTY -- The man who posed as a soldier and spun a sad story to win the hearts and generosity of North Bend residents is also a level-three sex offender. The man who called himself Lt. Don Daily is actually Donald Burchett. And, after running out of luck in North Bend, he travelled to Bremerton with his military uniform and a different sob story. At least three churches in Bremerton said they received visits from a man dressed in fatigues and armed with a heartbreaking story. The man told church members the unform had actually belonged to his brother, who had been killed in Iraq. The man wanted money for food and a motel room to last him until he attends a relative's funeral in California, and local paid for his rooms at a nearby hotel. But Nancy Carver says she just didn't buy the man's story. "And I thought, 'this just doesn't feel right,"' she said. Carver and other employees of Silverdale Baptist Church followed their hunches that the Burchett's story just didn't add up. They ran a criminal check and couldn't believe what they found. "And we were just absolutely hoverrified to see the huge number of arrests he had," said Elissa Torgeson, a church employee. 33-year-old Burchett has eight felonies on record, including forgery, arson and burglary. Carver checked the sex offenders' list. She says she was shocked to find out Burchett is a level-three sex offender who had spent five years in prison and had just gotten out last spring. His crime involved a six-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy. "Oh, my lord," she said. Carver called the sheriff and deputies arrested Burchett at his hotel room for failing to register as a sex offender. "Level-three sex offenders have a high propensity to commit crimes again against individuals, and his crimes were against children. And therefore I consider him a danger to the community," said Kitsap County Sheriff Steve Boyer. Burchett never received treatment for his sex crime. A warrant was issued for his arrest for failing to check in with his parole officer. Burchett is being held on $50,000 bail. The county prosecutor is considering fraud charges.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7471782.html	Imposter soldier also a level-three sex offender | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Imposter soldier also a level-three sex offender This photo taken in April shows the man who claimed to be an Army soldier (Snoqualmie Valley Record). Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 6:49 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 11:06 PM PDT KITSAP COUNTY -- The man who posed as a soldier and spun a sad story to win the hearts and generosity of North Bend residents is also a level-three sex offender. The man who called himself Lt. Don Daily is actually Donald Burchett. And, after running out of luck in North Bend, he travelled to Bremerton with his military uniform and a different sob story. At least three churches in Bremerton said they received visits from a man dressed in fatigues and armed with a heartbreaking story. The man told church members the unform had actually belonged to his brother, who had been killed in Iraq. The man wanted money for food and a motel room to last him until he attends a relative's funeral in California, and local paid for his rooms at a nearby hotel. But Nancy Carver says she just didn't buy the man's story. "And I thought, 'this just doesn't feel right,"' she said. Carver and other employees of Silverdale Baptist Church followed their hunches that the Burchett's story just didn't add up. They ran a criminal check and couldn't believe what they found. "And we were just absolutely hoverrified to see the huge number of arrests he had," said Elissa Torgeson, a church employee. 33-year-old Burchett has eight felonies on record, including forgery, arson and burglary. Carver checked the sex offenders' list. She says she was shocked to find out Burchett is a level-three sex offender who had spent five years in prison and had just gotten out last spring. His crime involved a six-year-old girl and a ten-year-old boy. "Oh, my lord," she said. Carver called the sheriff and deputies arrested Burchett at his hotel room for failing to register as a sex offender. "Level-three sex offenders have a high propensity to commit crimes again against individuals, and his crimes were against children. And therefore I consider him a danger to the community," said Kitsap County Sheriff Steve Boyer. Burchett never received treatment for his sex crime. A warrant was issued for his arrest for failing to check in with his parole officer. Burchett is being held on $50,000 bail. The county prosecutor is considering fraud charges.

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7471962.html	Governor signs bill that aims to make truck driving safer | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Governor signs bill that aims to make truck driving safer Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 7:07 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 7:18 PM PDT Making truck driving safer is the goal of a bill just signed into law. Two women widowed by a logging truck accident are celebrating a bittersweet victory today. No matter were you go in the northwest you're sharing the road with logging trucks and other big rigs. Now thanks to two grieving women your drive is going to be safer. Tony Qamar and Dan Johnson were best of friends. The volcanic scientists worked together and they died together. A logging truck driver lost his load. The logs spilled onto Highway 101. The geologists who managed to survive the wrath of Mother Nature with their jobs didn't survive this crash. "We still feel like that was yesterday," said Qamar's widow Kathleen Ellsbury. "Getting that call from state patrol. Describing the accident is hard is still pretty vivid." But she and Johnson's widow Eileen Llona turned their anguish in action. They lobbied the Legislature for tougher truck safety laws. "It was just such an outrage to me that he died because of carelessness," Ellsbury told a news conference last session. Their persistence paid off as the Legislature passed the bill and the governor signed it into law giving the state patrol more authority to go after truck companies to keep them safe. The governor realizes it took a great deal of emotional strength to continue to wage this fight. "And to them, we owe a great deal of gratitude," Gov. Gregoire said. "Out of their great terrible loss, they are trying to make sure none of the rest of us suffer the consequences they have suffered and their families have suffered." "I believe if this had been in place perhaps my husband would still be alive," Llona said. The two never planned they'd be going down this path. But they say on their husbands' behalf they need to do all they can to prevent this from happening again. The two aren't done. Next session they be back to urge tighter controls of the drivers of those trucks. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

http://www.komotv.com/news/local/7470902.html	Gregoire OKs union dues measure | KOMO-TV - Seattle, Washington | Local & Regional Gregoire OKs union dues measure Story Published: May 11, 2007 at 5:34 PM PDT Story Updated: May 11, 2007 at 7:20 PM PDT OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) - Gov. Chris Gregoire on Friday signed legislation allowing labor unions to spend nonmembers' bargaining fees on political causes without first getting their permission. The new law cleared the Legislature almost exclusively with Democratic votes last month, with critics calling it a clear labor-backed attempt to circumvent a pending ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in a case involving the Washington Education Association. Gregoire, when she was still attorney general, initiated the case that is moving through the high court. Rep. Joe McDermott, D-Seattle, and other sponsors insisted the bill wasn't related to the litigation and simply clarifies accounting rules. State law regulates how unions can spend fees paid by workers who don't join the bargaining group. The nonmembers can be charged "agency fees" by the union to help finance bargaining that affects them, but they can't be forced to pay for the union's political activities. Nonmembers represented by the WEA can ask for a partial refund of part of their fees. The bill signed by the governor deals with commingling of funds. It says that when labor organizations make political campaign contributions, they aren't considered to be using agency shop fees when the union treasury has enough money to cover the contributions from other revenue sources. "This change in law provides clarity and should prevent future questions over interpretations of the proper use of agency shop fees," Gregoire said. She said it's a simple and well-accepted accounting principle and "in no way changes the prohibition against agency shop fees being spent for political purposes without affirmative authorization from individual agency fee payers." Debra Carnes of the WEA hailed the new law. "We think it's a good piece of legislation because it provides clarification that we haven't been able to get before now," she said. "We believe that now our members can move forward together to collectively speak out on issues that affect the profession." Sen. Jeanne Kohl-Welles, D-Seattle, said during Senate debate that nonunion members have always had, and will still maintain, the right to object and get a rebate. But opponents said that unless a nonmember specifically asks for a refund, that person won't know whether his fees are being used for political purposes he doesn't support. Initiative 134, a campaign-finance measure approved by voters in 1992, required unions to secure permission from each nonmember before spending any portion of the fees on politics. But that provision was overturned by the state Supreme Court. Some teachers and the state appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. During a memo to the Legislature this year, the attorney general's office said the bill could expose the state to further litigation by adopting a "constitutionally forbidden" accounting procedure. The case stemmed from a complaint filed by the Evergreen Freedom Foundation, an Olympia-based conservative think tank. The foundation and the WEA have sparred for years about nonmember fees. The group complained about the new law and about Gregoire's decision to leave in place an emergency clause that made it take effect immediately, rather than allow a possible referendum campaign in the next 90 days. "Today, Gov. Gregoire has signed a bill that ignores the First Amendment rights of workers in order to expand union power," said EFF labor policy director Mike Reitz. "The bill is premature, because the U.S. Supreme Court could rule on the constitutionality of the law at any time. "Signing this bill virtually guarantees continued litigation." The governor also signed measures dealing with: -NIGHTCLUB SPRINKLERS. The new law requires nightclubs to install automatic sprinkler systems by Dec. 1, 2009. -FARM FUEL. Biodiesel fuel, including diesel blend, is exempted from sales tax when used by farmers off the highway. -LEMON LAW. The state's "lemon law" protecting consumers who buy or lease vehicles is extended to out-of-state customers who buy or lease here and register them elsewhere. The union fees measure is House Bill 2079. The sprinkler bill is HB1811. The tax bill is SB5009. The lemon law bill is HB2135. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

The front page features a drawing of a disgruntled student wearing a shirt with the words "f--- school". The "f" word is not censored. The paper made the bold move to make people pick up the paper. But the picture has some people who didn't pick it up questioning how a paper that's sold visibly in stores and newstands get away it. Perry McCollister, says grabbing the Seattle Weekly was an eye-opener. "It looks like he's on drugs and he's saying 'f-- school.' That's not a good attitude," he said of the picture. It's the reaction the paper was hoping for. Their feature piece talks about truancy and students with bad attitudes toward schools, so why not a cover that reflects that? "I took a look at the guy on the cover and I thought, 'what is this guy thinking?' And it was crystal clear," said Mike Seely, the Weekly's managing editor. So they took the bold move and added "f--- school" on the shirt. "It's something of a risky endeavor, but we are the type of publication that can take chances and we did," Seely said. But William Thompson says he wasn't amused. "I couldn't believe you could actually print that and put it on a public newstand," William Thompson said. But since the "f"word is not considered obscene by law, you can. Still, some people want stores to pull the paper, and some have. Other stores like Scarecrow Video say they couldn't care less. "It doesn't do anything for me either way," said Matt Lynch, a clerk at Scarecrow. "We don't censor anything here at all." The Weekly did exercise a bit of self-censorship by not taking the same risk with its online version. The paper put the "f" word right on the front page for everyone, young and old, to see. But the picture on the site features the same disgruntled student, but no "f" word. Double standard? Seely says yes, and rightfully so. "What we do with the cover is totally different what we do on the Web. We are trying to grab people's attention and I think this cover, for better or worse, certainly succeeds in that capacity," he said. The Seattle Weekly has a circulation of roughly 107,000. KOMO 4 News has received several viewer e-mails complaining about the controversial cover. The Weekly admits it has received similar e-mails as well, but in numbers that were far fewer than were expected. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop.

(AP) - A Washington State University professor sued by a student alleging sexual harassment has resigned as part of an agreement that will provide legal representation and pay any judgment in the lawsuit. Bernardo Gallegos, a professor of multicultural education since 2004, is accused of making advances toward a married graduate student in his home in February 2005. In exchange for his resignation, he will be paid more than $87,000 to buy out his tenure, though he will lose some benefits. His salary was more than $132,000 a year. The student, Christina Garcia, sued Gallegos and the university, saying her ability to get an education was damaged and that Gallegos wasn't adequately disciplined, although a university investigation concluded that he violated school policies. Gallegos has maintained his innocence. He did not immediately return a call for comment on Friday. The agreement between Gallegos and the WSU regents, approved May 4, said the university will defend and indemnify him in the Whitman County Superior Court lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges Gallegos committed sexual harassment when he took Garcia to his candlelit home in February 2005. Gallegos was not her direct supervisor or instructor, but was in a position to influence her education, a judge ruled. A trial is scheduled for September. Guy Nelson, who represents Garcia, said he was happy with the agreement. "We believe the board of regents took a very positive step," he said. The regents also have adopted a new policy on sexual harassment and discrimination. The revisions to the policy were first proposed shortly after the lawsuit was filed. The new policy creates new reporting responsibilities for supervisors and establishes a more specific range of disciplinary action. Assistant Attorney General Suzanne Parisien, who represents the university, said the agreement to sever ties with Gallegos was made in the best interest of the university. Parisien now will also defend Gallegos at trial. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free! The latest news video from KOMO.

(AP) - A Vancouver, Washington, man has been sentenced to 13 months in prison for pretending to be mentally regarded in order to claim disability benefits. 28-year-old Pete J. Costello was sentenced today in U.S. District Court by Judge Ronald Leighton in Tacoma. His mother, Rosie M. Costello, will be sentenced Thursday for coaching her son and daughter to feign mental retardation. The sister, Marie Costello, has not been located by authorities. Costello began receiving Social Security disability benefits when he was 8. He was ordered to repay the $59,226 he has received since turning 18. In 2005, federal agents received a tip that Costello had driver's licenses in three states under fake names. His mother claimed he was unable to dress or feed himself or even leave the house. Costello cannot read or write. His mother collected $287,715 during a 20-year period. Get news alerts delivered to your e-mail or desktop. Watch ABC shows and news online, free!

Police reports obtained by the Seattle P-I suggest some officers may have gone too far to stop illegal dancing by mixing business with pleasure. Eight dancers were arrested at the Déjà Vu in March for illegal dancing. More than a dozen others were arrested at Rick's in Lake City last December. During those raids, officers tried to find out whether the dancers would solicit prostitution. And those extra steps they took to find out is raising a few eyebrows. In Seattle, exotic dancers can strip nearly naked while on stage, but not off stage. It's also illegal for dancers to touch customers. But according to the police reports from the two raids, which was obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, officers did more than just watch. "I grabbed her buttocks with both hands and kept them there throughout the dance," wrote one officer. "I asked her if I could touch it," wrote another officer. "I undid my belt," wrote another. All these actions reportedly took place after the dancers allegedly broke the law by exposing their genitals or touching the officers. KOMO 4 News was declined an on-camera interview with the Seattle Police Department. But the supervisor of the department's vice unit did talk to a Seattle P-I reporter. "if you just sit there with your hands tucked at your sides, they're going to know you're a cop," Eric Sano with the Seattle Police Department Vice Unit told the newspaper. One officer paid $100 for four lap dances from the same dancer even though she allegedly broke the law after the first one. City Councilman Nick Licata chairs the Public Safety Commmittee, which oversees the police department. Licata says the reports raise questions. "Is this how the police department is spending public money?" he said. "Our officers can be much better serving the public by being visible the neighborhoods than being in some dark club some place to see if they can arrest an exotic dancer." Deja Vu's attorney Jack Burns says the officers went too far. "They are overstepping the boundary.They had 12 to 25 officers out there to try and catch eight girls," he said.
