Changes to the Low Carbon Buildings Programme mean that future applicants will be limited to £2,500 for domestic micro-generation projects. Previously, grants of up to £15,000 and £5,000 were available for solar energy and micro-turbine schemes respectively. Ministers said the changes would enable more people to participate. Demand for the scheme, introduced last year, has been intense with monthly allocations of money being fully subscribed within minutes. Grants worth £6.8m have been awarded so far and a further £11.9m in funding is available. There is no justification for the decision in terms of strategy or support for domestic renewable electricity market Seb Berry, Solar Century However, less than £3.5m of the money has been spent, following planning hold-ups, delays to building schedules and flawed applications. This has led some people to claim that the scheme - a key plank in the government's efforts to promote energy efficiency - is in crisis. The application process was suspended in March pending a review, which has resulted in a cut in individual grants, a reduction in the time people have to finish projects and a revamp of the application process. Companies involved in micro-generation criticised the decision to reduce individual grant levels, one describing it as "unnecessary and baffling". "There is no justification for the decision in terms of strategy or support for domestic renewable electricity market," said Seb Berry, external affairs director of Solar Century, which designs and installs solar panels. With the typical cost of buying and installing a solar panel system about £7,000, Mr Berry said the changes would make the project unviable for many people. "You are asking individual homeowners to find £4,000 to £5,000 of their own money." Bu the government defended alterations to the scheme, saying it would ensure more projects were completed and help domestic renewables become more self-sustaining. "We can't fund everybody in the country who wants to do it," said a DTI spokesman. "We have a limited amount of money and we want to spread that as far as we can."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/world/middle_east/6633979.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | King Herod's ancient tomb 'found' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Tuesday, 8 May 2007, 16:23 GMT 17:23 UK E-mail this to a friend King Herod's ancient tomb 'found' Archaeologists believe this is the podium of Herod's tomb An Israeli archaeologist says he has found the tomb of King Herod, the ruler of Judea while it was under Roman administration in the first century BC. After a search of more than 30 years, Ehud Netzer of the Hebrew University says he has located the tomb at Herodium, a site south of Jerusalem. Herod was noted in the New Testament for his Massacre of the Innocents. Told of Jesus' birth, Herod ordered all children under two in Bethlehem to be killed, the Gospel of Matthew said. According to the New Testament, Jesus' father Joseph was warned of the threat in a dream and fled with his wife and child to Egypt. "When I realised it was the tomb there was great happiness," said Prof Netzer, who has worked at the Herodium site since 1972. Roman-appointed King of Judea from around 37 BC to 4 BC A bloody ruler who killed political rivals Ordered the Massacre of Innocents to protect his throne, the New Testament says Behind ambitious building projects including expanding Second Jewish Temple and walls around Jerusalem "Everyone has an interest in the Holy Land and Herod's tomb is part of that story." It was an ancient staircase built for Herod's funeral procession - described in detail by First Century historian Josephus Flavius - that led Prof Netzer's team to the hill-top burial site. "The monumental stairs were built specifically for the funeral," Prof Netzer said. At the site, archaeologists found a smashed limestone sarcophagus that, when whole, would have been around 2.5m (8ft) long. Ornate rosette decorations on the fragments alerted the team to the coffin's significance. No bones were found at the site. Prof Netzer said that they had likely been removed by Jewish rebels who fought against Rome between 66 and 72 AD. The site at Herodium is in the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967. Palestinians officials have in the past complained about what they see as the theft and commercial exploitation of their artefacts. If the find is confirmed, this will rank as a major archaeological discovery, BBC Jerusalem correspondent Tim Franks says. Experts have always believed that Herod was buried somewhere within the palace complex he had constructed on a flattened hilltop in the Judean desert, but they had repeatedly struggled to find any evidence to back up their theories. Herod was appointed "King of the Jews" by the Roman authorities and ruled Judea from 37 BC until his death in around 4 BC. He is known for his expansion of the Second Jewish Temple and the construction of walls around the Old City of Jerusalem. He also built the fortress of Masada, which became the last stand of Jewish rebels in 73 AD.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6638017.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Scientists compile 'book of life' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Wednesday, 9 May 2007, 18:20 GMT 19:20 UK E-mail this to a friend Scientists compile 'book of life' All known species including the zorilla will be included Long-snouted aardvarks will rub shoulders with skunk-like zorillas in an ambitious plan to provide a virtual snapshot of life on Earth. The Encyclopedia of Life project aims to detail all 1.8 million known plant and animal species in a net archive. Individual species pages will include photographs, video, sound and maps, collected and written by experts. The archive, to be built over 10 years, could help conservation efforts as well as being a useful tool for education. "The Encyclopedia of Life will provide valuable biodiversity and conservation information to anyone, anywhere, at any time," said Dr James Edwards, executive director of the $100m (£50m) project. "[It] will ultimately make high-quality, well-organized information available on an unprecedented level." The vast database will initially concentrate on animals, plants and fungi with microbes to follow. Fossil species may eventually be added. There could be up to 100 million species in the world To begin with, information will be harvested from existing databases, such as FishBase which already contains details of 29,900 species. "One of the big tasks in the first six months will be to identify which groups we will focus on after that," Graham Higley of London's Natural History Museum, one of the partners in the project, told the BBC News website. As the archive grows, it will become a "web of life" that will represent the relationships between different species on Earth. During this gestation, teams of scientists will pore over it. "They will be looking to identify species where the information is thin - and it is on an awful lot of species - to make it more comprehensive and usable," said Mr Higley. The database has been in development since January 2006, although web pages dedicated to individual species have been produced ad hoc since the mid 1990s. The scientists involved in the project said that the ability to catalogue millions of entries on the web had only just become possible. "Advances in technology for searching, annotating, and visualising information now permit us - indeed mandate us - to build the Encyclopedia of Life," said Dr Edwards. It could eventually fill with many more species than the original 1.8 million known today. Biologists estimate that there could be anywhere between five and 100 million species on the planet. Other projects have previously attempted to index life on Earth. For example, the Catalogue of Life keeps a database of more than one million species. However, according to Mr Higley, it does not have the level of detail that the proposed Encyclopedia of Life will eventually contain. "It's a list of names," he said. "What it is not is a description of those species." Other databases have taken the identification process one step further. In 2005, scientists launched the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, an ongoing attempt to identify all species through a unique genetic marker system. These "tags" are composed of the order of DNA letters in a particular gene found in mitochondria, the "power units" in cells. The project has so far collected more than 250,000 barcodes and has described more than 27,000 species.

The immense, 50m-long vehicle powered away from Kourou in French Guiana at 1929 local time (2229 GMT). The Astra 1L and Galaxy 17 platforms it put in space will deliver TV and other services to Europe and North America. Friday's mission represented the second launch of the year for the Ariane 5 and its 32nd flight overall. The launch was delayed by a day because of poor weather over the spaceport on Thursday. The rocket is the workhorse of Europe's commercial launch service, operated by the French-based Arianespace company. In its heavy-lift, or ECA, configuration, the vehicle produces 13,000 kilonewtons of thrust at launch - equivalent to 20 Concorde jets at take-off. Watching the launch in Kourou was US space agency (Nasa) Administrator Dr Mike Griffin. The Nasa chief came to see the rocket that will begin to supply the International Space Station later this year. Europe is preparing a new cargo ship called the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), which will carry 7.5 tonnes of experimental equipment, spare parts, food, air and water to astronauts working on the orbiting outpost. The ATV is designed to ride into space on top of an Ariane 5.

The tunnel, dug in 1968, was the last of many made over the centuries by archaeologists exploring the site. Engineers are planning to stabilise the 5,000-year-old structure, which is believed to be the world's largest man-made prehistoric mound. Archaeologists will also try to unlock the site's ancient secrets and find out how, why and when it was built. Earlier this year, archaeologists found traces of a Roman settlement at the landmark. English Heritage, which is conducting the stabilising work, believes there was a Roman community at Silbury Hill about 2,000 years ago. It says the site may have been a sacred place of pilgrimage. "We don't know exactly what it was for but it was probably part of a ceremonial and sacred landscape which centered on the Avebury henge," said an English Heritage spokeswoman. English Heritage is conducting stabilisation work at the site The 130ft Neolithic mound near Avebury - one of Europe's largest prehistoric monuments - is thought to have been created some 3,000 years earlier. Heavy rains in May 2000 caused substantial damage to the hill, with the collapse of an 18th century shaft. Parts of the ancient site are thought to be collapsing because of the tunnels dug by archaeologists over many centuries. After prising open the tunnel's sealed door on Friday, engineers are expected to spend four months, filling the tunnels with hundreds of tonnes of chalk to stabilise the structure. Archaeologists will also be going into the hill, hoping that modern science can solve the mystery of why the hill was built in the first place.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6636467.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | UN warns on impacts of biofuels Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Wednesday, 9 May 2007, 08:16 GMT 09:16 UK E-mail this to a friend UN warns on impacts of biofuels Plantations for biofuels may threaten forests and wildlife A UN report warns that a hasty switch to biofuels could have major impacts on livelihoods and the environment. Produced by a cross-agency body, UN Energy, the report says that biofuels can bring real benefits. But there can be serious consequences if forests are razed for plantations, if food prices rise and if communities are excluded from ownership, it says. And it concludes that biofuels are more effective when used for heat and power rather than in transport. "Current research concludes that using biomass for combined heat and power (CHP), rather than for transport fuels or other uses, is the best option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade - and also one of the cheapest," it says. The European Union and the US have recently set major targets for the expansion of biofuels in road vehicles, for which ethanol and biodiesel are seen as the only currently viable alternative to petroleum fuels. The UN report, Sustainable Bioenergy: A Framework for Decision Makers, suggests that biofuels can be a force for good if they are planned well, but can bring adverse consequences if not. "The development of new bioenergy industries could provide clean energy services to millions of people who currently lack them," it concludes, "while generating income and creating jobs in poorer areas of the world." Intensive farming of energy crops demands water and resources But the prices of food, land and agricultural commodities could be driven up, it warns, with major impacts in poorer countries where people spend a much greater share of their incomes on food than in developed nations. On the environmental side, it notes that demand for biofuels has accelerated the clearing of primary forest for palm plantations, particularly in southeast Asia. This destruction of ecosystems which remove carbon from the atmosphere can lead to a net increase in emissions. The report warns too of the impacts on nature: "Use of large-scale mono-cropping could lead to significant biodiversity loss, soil erosion and nutrient leaching." This has been avoided, the report says, in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo where sugar cane farmers are obliged to leave a percentage of their land as natural reserves. Water is also a concern. The expanding world population and the on-going switch towards consumption of meat and dairy produce as incomes rise are already putting pressure on freshwater supplies, which increased growing of biofuel crops could exacerbate. In conclusion, UN Energy suggests policymakers should take a holistic look before embarking on drives to boost biofuel use. "Only through a convergence of biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions and water-use policies can bioenergy find its proper environmental context and agricultural scale," the report concludes.

Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces." A sample of the artificial blood prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6645179.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Americas | Nasa unveils Hubble's successor Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 00:00 GMT 01:00 UK E-mail this to a friend Nasa unveils Hubble's successor The model of the JWST is on display in Washington DC. The US space agency Nasa has unveiled a model of a space telescope that scientists say will be able to see to the farthest reaches of the Universe. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is intended to replace the ageing Hubble telescope. It will be larger than its predecessor, sit farther from Earth and have a giant mirror to enable it to see more. Officials said the JWST - named after a former Nasa administrator - was on course for launch in June 2013. The full-scale model is being displayed outside the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in the US capital, Washington DC. It was recently shown off in Seattle at the American Astronomical Society meeting. The $4.5bn (£2.3bn) telescope will take up a position some 1.5 million km (930,000 miles) from Earth. It will measure 24m (80ft) long by 12m (40ft) high and incorporate a hexagonal mirror 6.5m (21.3ft) in diameter, almost three times the size of Hubble's. Hubble, launched in 1990, has sent back pictures of our solar system, distant stars, and remote fledgling galaxies formed not long after the Big Bang. But scientists say the JWST will enable them to look deeper into space and even further back at the origins of the Universe. "Clearly we need a much bigger telescope to go back much further in time to see the very birth of the Universe," said Edward Weiler, director of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre. Martin Mohan of Northrop Grumman, the contractor building the telescope, said that the team was making excellent progress. "There's engineering to do, but invention is done, more than six years ahead of launch," he said. When ready, the JWST will be launched by a European Ariane 5 rocket. It is expected to have a 10-year lifespan. Until then, the 17-year-old Hubble telescope will continue to do its work. Nasa plans to send astronauts on the space shuttle to service it in 2008. THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST is named after James E Webb, Nasa Administrator during the Apollo lunar exploration era; he served from 1961 to 1968 It will be placed 1.5m km from Earth, at Lagrange Point 2, an area of gravitational balance that keeps it in a Sun-Earth line The telescope will be shaded from sunlight by a shield, enabling it to stay cold, increasing its sensitivity to infrared radiation Three principal instruments will gather images of the Universe in the infrared region of the spectrum These will yield new information about how stars and galaxies first formed a few hundred million years after the Big Bang E-mail this to a friend Telescope mirror nears completion 08 Feb 07 | Science/Nature First stars in telescope's sights 12 Jan 07 | Science/Nature Large camera delights astronomers 10 Nov 03 | Science/Nature The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites Pope creates Brazil's first saint UK police face no action on shooting Nasa unveils Hubble's successor MOST POPULAR STORIES NOW Google searches web's dark side Confused penguin strays 5,000km Vultures pick off human body farm Nasa unveils Hubble's successor Floyd play at Barrett tribute gig Most popular now, in detail Confused penguin strays 5,000km Madeleine parents 'won't give up' Google searches web's dark side Two dead children were murdered Brown makes pitch to lead Britain Most popular now, in detail Locals believe police are doing all they can to find Madeleine Historic visit to the Boyne points way to the future How will history judge Tony Blair's war record?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/6647545.stm	BBC NEWS | Scotland | South of Scotland | Red squirrel dies from deadly pox Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 16:58 GMT 17:58 UK E-mail this to a friend Red squirrel dies from deadly pox The squirrel was found displaying symptoms of the virus The first case of a red squirrel dying in Scotland as a result of the squirrel pox virus has been confirmed. The animal, which was displaying classic symptoms of the virus, was found near Lockerbie, Dumfries and Galloway, on Tuesday. The squirrel was euthanised following an examination at the South of Scotland Wildlife Hospital, Dumfries. Edinburgh vets then confirmed squirrel pox. The virus is carried by non-native grey squirrels. Conservationists have been working hard to try and stop the virus coming over the border into Scotland, and until now had been successful. We are very concerned about the spread of the virus into red squirrels in Scotland Intensive control measures have been in place since its presence in Scotland was first detected in invasive populations of grey squirrels in May 2005. Although the virus is fatal to red squirrels, greys remain unaffected by the disease. Scottish Natural Heritage currently has two grey squirrel control officers working in the south of Scotland. Professor Colin Galbraith, director of policy and advice at Scottish Natural Heritage, said: "SNH has been working with the Southern Upland Partnership to monitor the squirrel pox situation in grey squirrels in the south of Scotland for the past six months. "We were aware that the virus been found in a red squirrel less than a mile south of the border and had feared that, at some point, the disease would transfer to the red squirrels in Scotland. The red squirrels contract the virus from non-native grey squirrels "Targeted grey squirrel control in the area has undoubtedly delayed the progression of the disease to Scottish red squirrels and we will continue our intensive grey squirrel control in the affected areas to allow further time to investigate the development of a vaccine." He said the squirrel control officers would continue to monitor and test squirrels to minimise the spread of the disease. Local red squirrel conservation officer Ann-Marie MacMaster urged the public to report red or grey squirrels which appeared to be ill. "Once red squirrels develop lesions, they are extremely infectious," she said. "We would also ask people in the Lockerbie area especially not to encourage the two species of squirrel together through the use of feeders as this may facilitate the spread of the disease." Gordon Patterson, biodiversity policy adviser for the Forestry Commission Scotland, said: "We are very concerned about the spread of the virus into red squirrels in Scotland. "Our staff are already involved in the monitoring work and we will now look out with extra vigilance for any signs of diseased red squirrels in the area and report them to the project team." Tests on the squirrel's body were carried out at the Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh. The red squirrel is one of the most threatened species of mammal in the UK with 75% (121,000 animals) of the population estimated to be found in Scotland. In February 2007, the Scottish Executive awarded a two-year contract to investigate the development of a vaccine against squirrel pox virus.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/magazine/6632179.stm	BBC NEWS | Magazine | Portrait of a perfect murder Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Monday, 7 May 2007, 11:58 GMT 12:58 UK E-mail this to a friend Portrait of a perfect murder Most murderers are unaware of even the simplest clues that might give them away. But by thinking like a forensic scientist, is the "perfect" murder possible? The so-called perfect murder - an undetectable crime where the killer gets away scot free - has long been the stuff of mystery fiction. From the icicle to the leg of lamb, authors have strived to come up with more imaginative weapons and crimes than their predecessors. But would any of these ingenious methods work? Staging a death to look like an accident is one of the first things an aspiring murderer might try. But when a pathologist examines the body of the victim they're not just looking for the cause of death. Other minor injuries - like bruising from a struggle, or scratch marks where a body has been dragged - can reveal a murder. If you're dumping a body, of course you don't think where's the hypostasis, you just dump the body and run Another important clue is hypostasis. When someone dies their blood pressure falls, and gravity makes the blood pool in those regions of the body closest to the ground. This red staining is clearly visible, and can reveal the position of the body at death. If a body is found lying on its right-hand side, but the red staining due to hypostasis is down the left-hand side, then the body has clearly been moved. "It gives us a very important clue," says pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd. "If you're dumping a body, of course you don't think where's the hypostasis, you just dump the body and run." The body can reveal a lot of secrets, so a number of killers have tried to get rid of their victim's body altogether. In the 1940s the "acid bath murderer" John Haigh attempted to dissolve the bodies of six victims in sulphuric acid. This destroys bones and tissue but it can't digest fats - or plastic. This is how John Haigh was caught. A pair of dentures, a red plastic handbag, and three human gallstones - covered in a layer of fat - were retrieved from the acid sludge found at his workshop. One mistake and a killer is caught Another method of body disposal comes from forensic scientists themselves. DNA expert Eleanor Graham at the University of Leicester says: "It was developed for situations like the mass graves in Bosnia Herzegovina, where you find mostly skeletonised remains, but a bit of soft tissue adhering. "You need to clean these bones up and to preserve the DNA for identification purposes. The old systems included boiling at high temperatures which was extremely destructive to the DNA." What these scientists now do is simply heat the remains gently with biological washing powder. The biological enzymes eat away at the flesh, leaving just the bones behind. This would certainly make a murder more difficult to investigate but not impossible. Some people are more likely to deposit their DNA than other people Gunshot and knife wounds may still be visible on the bones, and any blow with a blunt instrument is likely to have shattered or cracked them. But there is a weapon that wouldn't leave visible evidence behind. It's the one professional assassins favour - poison. The victim may not even realise what's happened until the murderer is many miles away. The most recent example is Alexander Litvinenko's poisoning with polonium late last year. It took the investigators weeks to identify the poison, because polonium-210 had never been used in this way before. But what Litvinenko's poisoner may not have realised is that this ingenious poison might also give them away. The alpha radiation given out by polonium-210 can be detected in incredibly small quantities. As the poisoner escaped they were leaving behind a radioactive trail that may yet lead to their capture. This type of trace evidence is the final piece of the perfect murder puzzle. Modern crime scene investigators can spot much more than just fingerprints. The CSI team can pick up tiny fibres of clothing, shoeprints from a carpet, and of course DNA. The world's best detectives are one step ahead And Ms Graham says our DNA may actually make some of us better criminals than others. "Some people are more likely to deposit their DNA than other people. One person could pick up a bottle of water, put it down, you get a full profile. "Another one could drink from it and you wouldn't pick up very much. No one knows exactly why this is but there does seem to be a very big difference." So if someone sheds less DNA, that would reduce the risk of leaving tell-tale evidence. But that's also why the real-life "perfect" murder is likely to fail. It relies too heavily on chance. Every single element must come together perfectly. The forensic scientists need just one mistake and the criminal could be caught. If someone wants to get away with murder their best hope is to be very, very lucky. Horizon: How to commit the perfect murder is on BBC Two at 2100 BST on Tuesday 8 May A selection of your comments appears below. One of the American Mafia bosses had sign above his desk saying something like "the best secret is known by three men, and two of them are dead". The only way to commit a "perfect" murder is by conspiracy and to have bent cops on your side....there is always a mistake, or a link to the killer otherwise. The other way to do a perfect murder would be in a totally random way-like some kind of psycho, killing a stranger then leaving the country. Phil Harrington, Newport S Wales If you want to kill someone and get away with it; run them over. Many car-related crimes are unsolved and killing someone with a car is seen, in our society, as far less serious than doing so with a gun. Has anyone found the white Fiat that was in the underpass with Diana's Merc? The perfect murder was the execution of Charles I. The man had a mask on, there were no forensics then, and despite scores of witnesses, the killer was never even questioned. Nigel Macarthur, London, England Of course there may be thousands of perfect murders a year - the point being that if they are perfect murders then no-one will recognise them as such, they will be suicides, accidents or natural deaths. We therefore have no way of knowing quite how good current forensics are. Perfect Murder? Elvis Presley. Perfect murders happen all the time. Every unsolved murder, every missing person, perhaps. The greatest perfect murders have probably already happened because the police defined them suicides or accidents. So the perfect murder is one that one even thinks is a murder. If people think that shows like Quincy or CSI show how to commit a perfect murder then they are very much mistaken. Both shows are riddled with scientific errors even an A level student would see through. Regardless of forensic evidence, it's still possible to be convicted of murder even without a body being found. John Airey, Peterborough, UK I think that there is the "perfect" murder, but probably just by accident. JonBenet Ramsey is one example. Kara Tyson, Mobile, AL USA This is all very interesting, but is it really responsible journalism? Programs like CSI have already been accused of the "CSI effect" - and they're really just entertainment programs, so the details aren't always realistic or accurate. Even if people don't use your information to get away with crimes, they may think they'll be able to get away with crimes. Therefore, people might commit crimes they'd otherwise have not committed, because of fear of getting caught. There is some information that should be closely guarded - here, the benefit of the information is limited, whilst the potential cost is high. Ankush, get a grip. This article reveals very little, and probably nothing that couldn't be found in an introductory pathology text book. I think that this article is irresponsible. Isn't there enough crime and murders in the world without giving hints on how to create the perfect crime and avoid being caught?! Some people may read this article and find it interesting. However, what about the people who aren't of sound mind? Surely this puts ideas into their head. While I see merit in comments relating to copy-cat style happenings, if someone is willing to commit a murder, they will do it regardless of whether they read/saw something that would 'help' them. There is way too much finger-pointing going on in today's society, what is wrong with portraying an informative subject on a darker matter? It's much better than another show about driving decorated cars too fast or making way for another fickle reality show. Simon Clements-Hawes, Truro, Cornwall Sounds like an interesting programme - pity it clashes with CSI.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/6634221.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Asia-Pacific | Coconut oil powers island's cars Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Tuesday, 8 May 2007, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK E-mail this to a friend Coconut oil powers island's cars People on the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea have found their own solution to high energy prices - the humble coconut. They are developing mini-refineries that produce a coconut oil that can replace diesel. From police officers to priests, the locals are powering up their vehicles and generators with coco-fuel. Inquiries for the coconut power have come in from overseas, including Iran and Europe. For years, the people of Bougainville have been dependent on expensive fuel imported onto the island. Shortages have often caused many businesses in this part of Papua New Guinea to grind to a halt. High energy costs have not helped either. Doesn't it sound good if you really run your car on something which falls off a tree and that's the good thing about it Increasingly, locals are turning to a cheaper and far more sustainable alternative to diesel. Coconut oil is being produced at a growing number of backyard refineries. Matthias Horn, a German migrant and an engineer, operates one such refinery. "They sometimes refer to me as the Mad German because how can you do that to your car... filling it with some coconut juice that you normally fry your fish in," he said. "The coconut tree is a beautiful tree. Doesn't it sound good if you really run your car on something which falls off a tree and that's the good thing about it. You run your car and it smells nice and it's environmentally friendly and that's the main thing." Mr Horn said his work had attracted interest from Iran. Refineries like his also produce oils for cooking and cosmetics as well as soap. Coconut power is not new in Bougainville. The island endured years of civil unrest in which thousands of people were killed in a fight for independence in the 1990s. Dwindling supplies of diesel forced islanders to look for alternatives and the coconut was chosen. In peacetime, new technology is propelling this sweet-smelling industry to greater heights.

But he says, in this week's Green Room, we also hold the key to solving these problems by attracting the brightest young minds into the world of science. It is easy in our day-to-day lives to believe we are detached from the wider environment, but that is an illusion Send us your comments Mankind has never had a greater need for science, and for the spark of human ingenuity to apply this to tackling today's great global challenges. Built on centuries of tradition and endeavour, the UK is second to none in the diversity and excellence of its scientific heritage. Our nation punches well above its weight in the quality and number of academic papers and citations, above Germany, France and Japan, and trailing only the far bigger economy of the US. It is vital therefore that we pay equal regard to ensuring that the UK's outstanding scientific outputs flow through to enhance the quality of life and prosperity for people in the UK, and beyond. The challenges facing science, and humanity, as we move through the 21st Century are manifold. I would place none higher than the test we face in our stewardship of planet Earth. Even with our best efforts, we must be prepared for further global temperature rise as a result of past emissions It is a stern test, as demonstrated by a few stark facts. From around three billion people on the planet in 1950, global population has risen to over six billion today. By the middle of this century, it will exceed nine billion. Most future population growth will be in the developing world, where people quite reasonably aspire to the living standards enjoyed today by "western societies", such as our own. Yet it is estimated that, even with today's population, we would need the resources of three planets for people across the world to imitate western lifestyles. I do not advocate a hairshirt future, but clearly we need to find new ways to develop both our lifestyles and the planet we share. Negative impacts will dominate in all regions, says Sir David It is easy in our day-to-day lives to believe we are detached from the wider environment, but that is an illusion. Climate change presents us with a particular stringent test, which unmitigated will magnify many of the existing scourges of mankind: famine, drought, flood, disease and conflict. The scientific evidence is compelling beyond any reasonable doubt that unless we very radically transform our economies to reduce greenhouse emissions to a fraction of current levels then future generations will reap a heavy price. Indeed, the signals are already with us of the sort of changes that we can expect to continue and accelerate, as land ice melts, sea levels rise and extreme weather events become more severe. Even with our best efforts, we must be prepared for further global temperature rise as a result of past emissions, and the climate impacts associated with this. The outcome will initially be mixed, with positive and negative effects depending where in the world you live and on other factors. But in time the negative impacts will dominate in all regions, and will fall earliest and heaviest on the poorest countries, which are least able to adapt and which have contributed least to the problem. Carbon levels in the atmosphere continue to rise It will take an unprecedented international effort if we are to avoid the most dangerous climate changes that are predicted, and for individual countries to adapt to those impacts it is already too late for us to avoid. From climate change I move to another linked challenge - energy. Since the industrial revolution, fossil fuels have powered our economies and brought new levels of prosperity. But by releasing into the atmosphere carbon, as carbon dioxide, that has been naturally sequestered underground over tens to hundreds of millions of years, we have raised concentration levels in the atmosphere in just 150 years beyond anything seen for at least one million years, and probably far longer. At the same time, world energy demand is expected to rise by half as much again by 2030. Even with a major push on energy efficiency, there is a critical need for step changes in the pace at which we deploy current low-carbon technologies in developed and developing countries alike; and we must quickly advance the more innovative technologies such as carbon capture and storage, wave and tidal power, and solar photovoltaics. There are no simple solutions and there is certainly no single "silver bullet" technological fix. The pathway for advancing new energy technologies to technical and economic viability at scale is complex, difficult and inevitably takes time, even with major efforts to accelerate progress. The £1bn public/private Energy Technology Institute, launched by the UK Government, is an important new initiative in this area, providing good starting levels of investment, focus and ambition, and I hope in time will develop as part of a global network of similar centres of excellence. There has never been a greater need for inquisitive and determined young minds to develop the solutions needed for the 21st Century Nor can we tackle the problem by focusing on one sector alone. It is not a question of whether we should reduce emissions from our vehicles, or our houses, or industry, or in aviation or shipping, or through curbing deforestation. The scale of the challenge is such that we must do all of these things, whilst using our actions as a stimulus to galvanise the wider international response. And we must continue to prosper, not just for our own sakes but because those we seek to influence will not follow our lead if they perceive that environmental sustainability means economic decline. It is a powerful demonstration that in the UK we have been able to grow our economy in real terms by around half since 1990, whilst greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 15%. Action is affordable and is the pro-growth strategy. It is inaction that we cannot afford. Returning to where I began, science and technological innovation must be at the heart of the UK's approach as we tackle these and other of the great national and global challenges we face in the century ahead. But science does need to be redirected to meet these challenges. My message to any young person today mulling over their future career path is this: there has never been a better time to consider a future in scientific discovery; or in engineering to bring innovative technologies to real world application. And there has never been a greater need for inquisitive and determined young minds to develop the solutions needed for the 21st Century.

RSS enclosures are already being used to syndicate audio files and images. Media RSS extends enclosures to handle other media types, such as short films or TV, as well as provide additional metadata with the media. Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of . It allows grouping of elements that are effectively the same content, yet different representations. For instance: the same song recorded in both the WAV and MP3 format. It's an optional element that must only be used for this purpose. is a sub-element of either . Media objects that are not the same content should not be included in the same element. The sequence of these items implies the order of presentation. While many of the attributes appear to be audio/video specific, this element can be used to publish any type of media.

These optional attributes, along with the optional elements below, contain the primary metadata entries needed to index and organize media content. Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements. The priority level is listed from strongest to weakest: [NOTE: This is deprecated, and has been replaced with the more flexible This allows the permissible audience to be declared.

They are developing mini-refineries that produce a coconut oil that can replace diesel. From police officers to priests, the locals are powering up their vehicles and generators with coco-fuel. Inquiries for the coconut power have come in from overseas, including Iran and Europe. For years, the people of Bougainville have been dependent on expensive fuel imported onto the island. Shortages have often caused many businesses in this part of Papua New Guinea to grind to a halt. High energy costs have not helped either. Doesn't it sound good if you really run your car on something which falls off a tree and that's the good thing about it Increasingly, locals are turning to a cheaper and far more sustainable alternative to diesel. Coconut oil is being produced at a growing number of backyard refineries. Matthias Horn, a German migrant and an engineer, operates one such refinery. "They sometimes refer to me as the Mad German because how can you do that to your car... filling it with some coconut juice that you normally fry your fish in," he said. "The coconut tree is a beautiful tree. Doesn't it sound good if you really run your car on something which falls off a tree and that's the good thing about it. You run your car and it smells nice and it's environmentally friendly and that's the main thing." Mr Horn said his work had attracted interest from Iran. Refineries like his also produce oils for cooking and cosmetics as well as soap. Coconut power is not new in Bougainville. The island endured years of civil unrest in which thousands of people were killed in a fight for independence in the 1990s. Dwindling supplies of diesel forced islanders to look for alternatives and the coconut was chosen. In peacetime, new technology is propelling this sweet-smelling industry to greater heights.

The tunnel, dug in 1968, was the last of many made over the centuries by archaeologists exploring the site. Engineers are planning to stabilise the 5,000-year-old structure, which is believed to be the world's largest man-made prehistoric mound. Archaeologists will also try to unlock the site's ancient secrets and find out how, why and when it was built. Earlier this year, archaeologists found traces of a Roman settlement at the landmark. English Heritage, which is conducting the stabilising work, believes there was a Roman community at Silbury Hill about 2,000 years ago. It says the site may have been a sacred place of pilgrimage. "We don't know exactly what it was for but it was probably part of a ceremonial and sacred landscape which centered on the Avebury henge," said an English Heritage spokeswoman. English Heritage is conducting stabilisation work at the site The 130ft Neolithic mound near Avebury - one of Europe's largest prehistoric monuments - is thought to have been created some 3,000 years earlier. Heavy rains in May 2000 caused substantial damage to the hill, with the collapse of an 18th century shaft. Parts of the ancient site are thought to be collapsing because of the tunnels dug by archaeologists over many centuries. After prising open the tunnel's sealed door on Friday, engineers are expected to spend four months, filling the tunnels with hundreds of tonnes of chalk to stabilise the structure. Archaeologists will also be going into the hill, hoping that modern science can solve the mystery of why the hill was built in the first place.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6644697.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Galileo firms miss key deadline Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 22:25 GMT 23:25 UK E-mail this to a friend Galileo firms miss key deadline The Galileo spacecraft would be launched in batches The private consortium asked to run Europe's satellite navigation system, Galileo, has missed a key EU deadline for moving the project forward. The European Commission (EC) said the companies had made "insufficient progress", resulting in unacceptable delays and risks for public finances. This is likely to mean European taxpayers stepping in to cover an advance payment for construction costs. The EC is expected to present new plans to overhaul the project on 16 May. These will be sent for approval by the EU's transport ministers in June. The consortium comprises leading aerospace and telecom concerns: EADS, Thales, Inmarsat, Alcatel-Lucent, Finmeccanica, AENA, Hispasat, and TeleOp. The Commission set a 10 May deadline for them to come forward with a single company structure to run Galileo, a chief executive and common position from which to negotiate with EU representatives over the future of the project. On Thursday, the Commission announced that the target had not been met to its satisfaction. Michele Cercone, spokesman for the EC's directorate general for transport, said the Commission now intended to propose "different scenarios to put Galileo on the right track again". Galileo's planned network of 30 satellites will beam radio signals to receiving devices on the ground, helping users pinpoint their locations. The system's technologies are designed to bring greater accuracy and reliability to navigation and timing signals delivered from space. A European Commission and European Space Agency project 30 satellites to be launched in batches by end of 2011-12 Will work alongside US GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises real-time positioning down to less than a metre Guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances Suitable for safety-critical roles where lives depend on service Europe lofts Galileo satellite Q&A: Europe's Galileo project Galileo puts UK on map The original intention behind Galileo was that taxpayers in the EU would inject more than one billion euros (£0.7bn) into the early development of the project. The deployment phase - the launch of the satellites and the construction of ground stations - was expected to cost at least two billion more, with two-thirds of the investment being borne by the private sector. The latter was also expected to pick up all the running costs in the long term. The first demonstrator spacecraft, Giove-A, is already in orbit. A second, Giove-B, which has had some technical problems, should be in orbit by the year's end. The contract for the first four satellites proper in the final constellation was awarded at the end of 2004, but the time has now come to order the remaining 26. It should be the private concession making this spacecraft order - but with no progress on its formal establishment, it seems certain that European taxpayers will now have to shoulder a greater burden of the construction costs if Galileo is to stay on track. Mr Cercone said this option would be better for Europe's taxpayers in the long run. He likened the alternative options to the difference between leasing a car and buying one. "When you lease a car you pay less at the start, but it turns out more expensive in the end. When you buy a car for cash, you have to come up with the money sooner, but overall the car will cost less," he told a press briefing in Brussels. "If you apply this example to Galileo, it is less expensive to take on the entire construction of the infrastructure than it would be to guarantee for 100% a private loan at market value, as is the plan of the consortium." Under consortium proposals, public money would be used to guarantee the risks and debts of the project. But Mr Cercone said using public money to cover construction costs offered the best value for money and would protect taxpayers. Galileo was supposed to have started launching its 30 satellites by 2008. However, that date was postponed to 2011/12 due to previous disagreements between EU governments on how to pay for the system.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6645161.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Aboriginal remains fight resolved Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 23:29 GMT 00:29 UK E-mail this to a friend Aboriginal remains fight resolved The museum has many thousands on human items in its collection London's Natural History Museum has struck a deal with Australian aboriginal leaders over the remains of 17 indigenous Tasmanians it holds. The museum had agreed to return the remains to Tasmania, but not until tests were carried out on the bones. But Tasmanian aborigines viewed the tests as a desecration of their beliefs and took their case to the High Court. Under the settlement, four DNA samples from the 19th Century specimens will be preserved in Tasmania. The remains - including teeth, skulls and other bones removed from the island - will be turned over to a delegation from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre (TAC) in a private ceremony at the museum on Friday. The agreement means that scientists are not able to complete all the tests they had originally planned. But a Natural History Museum (NHM) spokesperson said the investigations were "conducted to a high level". She said museum researchers had extracted as much information as they could under limits on testing imposed in the High Court. "The decision by the museum's trustees in November last year represented a willingness to move on from past practices," said Richard Lane, the NHM director of science. "We're very pleased that we've been able to persuade them to preserve the DNA. We're actually quite enthusiastic that we've come to a constructive agreement. Both parties have travelled a long way," he told BBC news. Although the museum agreed to return the remains last year, it had maintained the right to continue testing them - taking casts and photographs and subjecting the specimens to CT scans and measurements. But TAC contested this part of the decision and initiated legal proceedings. In February 2007, an injunction was issued preventing the museum from studying the remains any further. This was subsequently lifted after the museum said it would limit its tests. Researchers would no longer use "invasive" techniques such as DNA extraction or isotope analysis, the museum agreed. These procedures might have yielded insight into the Aborigines' genetic make-up, their diet and aspects of their culture. Under the agreement now reached, DNA samples from four of the remains will be preserved in Tasmania under the joint control of the NHM and the TAC. These samples were extracted from the remains before the decision was taken to return them. "We have to work with the TAC for a framework that allows scientists to have access [to the DNA samples]. We have no preconceptions about how that is going to work," Professor Lane said. TAC representative Greg Brown told BBC News: "Now we have some power and say over what happens. Nothing can happen to the DNA samples unless it has the joint approval of the parties. "There are a lot of sensitivities over the use of DNA by our people and we want to have control over what happens with that." He could not comment on what types of research the TAC might find offensive, but said decisions would be made in consultation with the whole community. Mr Brown added that aboriginal leaders believed the samples should eventually be buried. The TAC objects to testing because it desecrates the beliefs of its community. The dead are said to be "souls in torment" until properly buried, according to aboriginal custom. The Tasmanian materials were largely collected in the 19th Century by George Augustus Robinson, who had been contracted by the colonial government of the day to clear lands by force for European settlers. On his death, the remains were passed into the possession of other individuals and eventually deposited in UK institutions, and then gradually brought under the keeping of the Natural History Museum. Scientists in the UK say the Tasmanian remains could shed light on human evolution, and particularly on the colonisation of Australia. Tasmanian populations appear to have been isolated from mainland aboriginal Australians for 10,000 years until the arrival of Europeans in the 19th Century. According to the TAC, there were around 8,000 Aboriginals in Tasmania when the British settled the island in 1802, but by 1850 there were just 47 left, after thousands were killed in massacres and or by disease brought in by the colonists.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6638017.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Scientists compile 'book of life' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Wednesday, 9 May 2007, 18:20 GMT 19:20 UK E-mail this to a friend Scientists compile 'book of life' All known species including the zorilla will be included Long-snouted aardvarks will rub shoulders with skunk-like zorillas in an ambitious plan to provide a virtual snapshot of life on Earth. The Encyclopedia of Life project aims to detail all 1.8 million known plant and animal species in a net archive. Individual species pages will include photographs, video, sound and maps, collected and written by experts. The archive, to be built over 10 years, could help conservation efforts as well as being a useful tool for education. "The Encyclopedia of Life will provide valuable biodiversity and conservation information to anyone, anywhere, at any time," said Dr James Edwards, executive director of the $100m (£50m) project. "[It] will ultimately make high-quality, well-organized information available on an unprecedented level." The vast database will initially concentrate on animals, plants and fungi with microbes to follow. Fossil species may eventually be added. There could be up to 100 million species in the world To begin with, information will be harvested from existing databases, such as FishBase which already contains details of 29,900 species. "One of the big tasks in the first six months will be to identify which groups we will focus on after that," Graham Higley of London's Natural History Museum, one of the partners in the project, told the BBC News website. As the archive grows, it will become a "web of life" that will represent the relationships between different species on Earth. During this gestation, teams of scientists will pore over it. "They will be looking to identify species where the information is thin - and it is on an awful lot of species - to make it more comprehensive and usable," said Mr Higley. The database has been in development since January 2006, although web pages dedicated to individual species have been produced ad hoc since the mid 1990s. The scientists involved in the project said that the ability to catalogue millions of entries on the web had only just become possible. "Advances in technology for searching, annotating, and visualising information now permit us - indeed mandate us - to build the Encyclopedia of Life," said Dr Edwards. It could eventually fill with many more species than the original 1.8 million known today. Biologists estimate that there could be anywhere between five and 100 million species on the planet. Other projects have previously attempted to index life on Earth. For example, the Catalogue of Life keeps a database of more than one million species. However, according to Mr Higley, it does not have the level of detail that the proposed Encyclopedia of Life will eventually contain. "It's a list of names," he said. "What it is not is a description of those species." Other databases have taken the identification process one step further. In 2005, scientists launched the Consortium for the Barcode of Life, an ongoing attempt to identify all species through a unique genetic marker system. These "tags" are composed of the order of DNA letters in a particular gene found in mitochondria, the "power units" in cells. The project has so far collected more than 250,000 barcodes and has described more than 27,000 species.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6640271.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Tiny marsupial records DNA first Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Wednesday, 9 May 2007, 18:00 GMT 19:00 UK E-mail this to a friend Tiny marsupial records DNA first The small creature is normally found in the trees of South America The grey, short-tailed opossum has become the first marsupial to have its DNA read through by scientists. The creature is commonly used in labs as an experimental "model" in which to study the causes of human disease, such as cancer and neurological problems. Knowing its genome will boost those efforts, and give new insight into the different evolutionary paths taken by marsupial and placental mammals. Details of the work appear in the journals Nature and Genome Research. The study is part of a grand scheme to compare the biochemistry of a range of animals with that of , to understand better how the human body is built and maintained, and how all species differ from one another. "The idea is to obtain genome sequence information from organisms that are appropriately spaced relative to us on the tree of life," explained Adam Felsenfeld, from the US National Human Genome Research Institute. "For example, by lining up the sequences it is possible to detect regions of the genome that have not changed, so are conserved and perhaps important; or, alternatively, regions that are changing very rapidly." In the wild, the opossum is found in the trees of South America. It was chosen as a subject to have its full complement of DNA (its genome) decoded because of its current importance to science. Its small size, ease of breeding and large litters have made the creature the predominant marsupial for laboratory study worldwide. The double-stranded DNA molecule is held together by four chemical components scientists refer to as bases Adenine (A) bonds with thymine (T); cytosine(C) bonds with guanine (G) Groupings of these "letters" form the "code of life"; there are about 3.4 billion base-pairs in the opossum genome Written in this DNA sequence are about 18-20,000 genes Genes are starting templates used by cells to make proteins; the sophisticated molecules that build and maintain the body Marsupial mammals (kangaroos, wallabies, etc) are closely related to the placental mammals (humans, mice, etc) - but not that close. They last shared a common ancestor about 180 million years ago and have arrived at very different reproductive solutions - with marsupials rearing their young externally, sometimes in a pouch. "This marsupial is a bit different in that the young are not kept in a pouch; they just dangle off the teats," observed Jenny Graves from the Australian National University. This open arrangement makes the study of early developmental processes much simpler, and should give scientists clues as to how they perform a number of very clever biological tricks. For example, when newborns crawl to their mother's teats, they are little more than a mouth and gut. They have no functioning immune system but are still able to survive in an open, "dirty" environment. Looking at the genes should help scientists work out how this is possible. Research has also shown that newborns can regrow their spinal cords, even if they are completely severed. "The genome hasn't told us exactly how they do that but the genome provides us with a blueprint for further study and for being able to apply some of that knowledge to humans," commented Chris Gunter, a senior biology editor at Nature. The decoding work, led by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reveals the opossum to have between 18,000 and 20,000 protein-coding genes. The number is a little short of what is seen in a placental mammal like a human - but broadly similar. The big difference, scientists say, is in the DNA sequences that are responsible for regulation of the genes - controlling when and where in cell processes they become active. "Twenty percent of all the regulatory instructions in the human genome were invented after we parted ways with the marsupial," explained Eric Lander, the director of the Broad Institute. "Evolution is tinkering much more with the controls than with the genes themselves." Many of these innovative DNA instructions were derived from so-called "jumping genes", or transposons - small pieces of genetic code that hop around the genome and were previously thought to have no function. "Transposons have a restless lifestyle, often shuttling themselves from one chromosome to another," said Broad researcher Tarjei Mikkelsen. "It is now clear that in their travels, they are disseminating crucial genetic innovations around the genome."

A Californian company has created software that can layer relevant recorded sounds over locations in Google Earth, New Scientist reports. Wild Sanctuary has over 3,500 hours of soundscapes from all over the world. The firm is in talks with Google, although no official agreement has yet been made. Its director, Bernie Krause said: "A picture tells a thousand words, but a sound tells a thousand pictures." Dr Krause has spent the last 40 years collecting sounds, and his recordings include more than 15,000 animal noises, and sounds from a huge array of habitats, including cities, deserts, mountains and the marine environment. It is the largest library in existence of natural sound, he said. He said the idea would be to zoom-in on a particular area and then have the option to listen to the accompanying sound. "It could be a real beneficial add-on," he said. The software is to be presented at the Where 2.0 conference in San Jose, California on 29 May.

"But we have evidence that from the sound perspective, selective logging has a profound effect on the natural world. The pictures of before and after look exactly the same, but the sound is completely different."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6640233.stm	BBC NEWS | Business | Grants cut for home energy scheme Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Wednesday, 9 May 2007, 17:10 GMT 18:10 UK E-mail this to a friend Grants cut for home energy scheme About 240 micro-turbines have been installed under the scheme The government's decision to reduce individual grants for homeowners wanting to produce their own renewable energy has been criticised. Changes to the Low Carbon Buildings Programme mean that future applicants will be limited to £2,500 for domestic micro-generation projects. Previously, grants of up to £15,000 and £5,000 were available for solar energy and micro-turbine schemes respectively. Ministers said the changes would enable more people to participate. Demand for the scheme, introduced last year, has been intense with monthly allocations of money being fully subscribed within minutes. Grants worth £6.8m have been awarded so far and a further £11.9m in funding is available. There is no justification for the decision in terms of strategy or support for domestic renewable electricity market Seb Berry, Solar Century However, less than £3.5m of the money has been spent, following planning hold-ups, delays to building schedules and flawed applications. This has led some people to claim that the scheme - a key plank in the government's efforts to promote energy efficiency - is in crisis. The application process was suspended in March pending a review, which has resulted in a cut in individual grants, a reduction in the time people have to finish projects and a revamp of the application process. Companies involved in micro-generation criticised the decision to reduce individual grant levels, one describing it as "unnecessary and baffling". "There is no justification for the decision in terms of strategy or support for domestic renewable electricity market," said Seb Berry, external affairs director of Solar Century, which designs and installs solar panels. With the typical cost of buying and installing a solar panel system about £7,000, Mr Berry said the changes would make the project unviable for many people. "You are asking individual homeowners to find £4,000 to £5,000 of their own money." Bu the government defended alterations to the scheme, saying it would ensure more projects were completed and help domestic renewables become more self-sustaining. "We can't fund everybody in the country who wants to do it," said a DTI spokesman. "We have a limited amount of money and we want to spread that as far as we can."

The syndicates gather ivory in Africa for export to East Asian countries. The biggest market is mainland China, though there is also significant trade to other countries such as Thailand and the Philippines. Traffic says there are 92 illegal ivory seizures per month, and the number of large hauls has doubled in a decade. Its report will be presented to next month's meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), where wildlife campaigners hope it will put pressure on governments whose countries are used by the traffickers. With myriad conflicts, central Africa is currently haemorrhaging ivory "The relevant question is whether CITES is going to crack down or not, whether governments are going to show some political will," said Sue Lieberman, director of the global species programme at WWF which runs Traffic together with the World Conservation Union (IUCN). "The Asian market is the key. It is thriving again in Thailand, and a lot of Chinese businesses have moved into Africa, for example timber companies, which means more ivory is coming out," she told the BBC News website. Traffic bases its report on an analysis of nearly 12,400 records of ivory seizures in 82 countries dating back to 1989 as part of the Elephant Trade Information System (Etis). Raw ivory and trinkets made from it on sale in an Angolan market It clearly identifies the Democratic Republic of Congo, Cameroon and Nigeria as the main sources of illegal ivory. "With myriad conflicts, central Africa is currently haemorrhaging ivory," observed Tom Milliken, director of Traffic's Africa programme. "These three countries are major conduits for trafficking illegal ivory from the region to international markets, particularly in Asia." The number of seizures fell between 1990 and 1995, but there has been a rising trend since then. The number of large hauls - above one tonne - has also risen, which Dr Lieberman believes "demonstrates greater sophistication, organisation and finance". China is identified as the single biggest market, though Traffic says enforcement has improved markedly in the last five years. On the African side, the conservation group singles out Ethiopia for praise as a country which has effectively implemented an action plan drawn up by CITES four years ago, clamping down on its domestic ivory market.

Researchers at Sheffield University said their creation could be a huge advantage in war zones. They say that the artificial blood is light to carry, does not need to be kept cool and can be kept for longer. The new blood is made up of plastic molecules that have an iron atom at their core, like haemoglobin, that can carry oxygen through the body. The scientists said the artificial blood could be cheap to produce and they were looking for extra funding to develop a final prototype that would be suitable for biological testing. Dr Lance Twyman, of the university's Department of Chemistry, said: "We are very excited about the potential for this product and about the fact that this could save lives. "Many people die from superficial wounds when they are trapped in an accident or are injured on the battlefield and can't get blood before they get to hospital. "This product can be stored a lot more easily than blood, meaning large quantities could be carried easily by ambulances and the armed forces." A sample of the artificial blood prototype will be on display at the Science Museum in London from 22 May as part of an exhibition about the history of plastics.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/6633979.stm	BBC NEWS | World | Middle East | King Herod's ancient tomb 'found' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Tuesday, 8 May 2007, 16:23 GMT 17:23 UK E-mail this to a friend King Herod's ancient tomb 'found' Archaeologists believe this is the podium of Herod's tomb An Israeli archaeologist says he has found the tomb of King Herod, the ruler of Judea while it was under Roman administration in the first century BC. After a search of more than 30 years, Ehud Netzer of the Hebrew University says he has located the tomb at Herodium, a site south of Jerusalem. Herod was noted in the New Testament for his Massacre of the Innocents. Told of Jesus' birth, Herod ordered all children under two in Bethlehem to be killed, the Gospel of Matthew said. According to the New Testament, Jesus' father Joseph was warned of the threat in a dream and fled with his wife and child to Egypt. "When I realised it was the tomb there was great happiness," said Prof Netzer, who has worked at the Herodium site since 1972. Roman-appointed King of Judea from around 37 BC to 4 BC A bloody ruler who killed political rivals Ordered the Massacre of Innocents to protect his throne, the New Testament says Behind ambitious building projects including expanding Second Jewish Temple and walls around Jerusalem "Everyone has an interest in the Holy Land and Herod's tomb is part of that story." It was an ancient staircase built for Herod's funeral procession - described in detail by First Century historian Josephus Flavius - that led Prof Netzer's team to the hill-top burial site. "The monumental stairs were built specifically for the funeral," Prof Netzer said. At the site, archaeologists found a smashed limestone sarcophagus that, when whole, would have been around 2.5m (8ft) long. Ornate rosette decorations on the fragments alerted the team to the coffin's significance. No bones were found at the site. Prof Netzer said that they had likely been removed by Jewish rebels who fought against Rome between 66 and 72 AD. The site at Herodium is in the West Bank, occupied by Israel since 1967. Palestinians officials have in the past complained about what they see as the theft and commercial exploitation of their artefacts. If the find is confirmed, this will rank as a major archaeological discovery, BBC Jerusalem correspondent Tim Franks says. Experts have always believed that Herod was buried somewhere within the palace complex he had constructed on a flattened hilltop in the Judean desert, but they had repeatedly struggled to find any evidence to back up their theories. Herod was appointed "King of the Jews" by the Roman authorities and ruled Judea from 37 BC until his death in around 4 BC. He is known for his expansion of the Second Jewish Temple and the construction of walls around the Old City of Jerusalem. He also built the fortress of Masada, which became the last stand of Jewish rebels in 73 AD.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6645161.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Aboriginal remains fight resolved Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 23:29 GMT 00:29 UK E-mail this to a friend Aboriginal remains fight resolved The museum has many thousands on human items in its collection London's Natural History Museum has struck a deal with Australian aboriginal leaders over the remains of 17 indigenous Tasmanians it holds. The museum had agreed to return the remains to Tasmania, but not until tests were carried out on the bones. But Tasmanian aborigines viewed the tests as a desecration of their beliefs and took their case to the High Court. Under the settlement, four DNA samples from the 19th Century specimens will be preserved in Tasmania. The remains - including teeth, skulls and other bones removed from the island - will be turned over to a delegation from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre (TAC) in a private ceremony at the museum on Friday. The agreement means that scientists are not able to complete all the tests they had originally planned. But a Natural History Museum (NHM) spokesperson said the investigations were "conducted to a high level". She said museum researchers had extracted as much information as they could under limits on testing imposed in the High Court. "The decision by the museum's trustees in November last year represented a willingness to move on from past practices," said Richard Lane, the NHM director of science. "We're very pleased that we've been able to persuade them to preserve the DNA. We're actually quite enthusiastic that we've come to a constructive agreement. Both parties have travelled a long way," he told BBC news. Although the museum agreed to return the remains last year, it had maintained the right to continue testing them - taking casts and photographs and subjecting the specimens to CT scans and measurements. But TAC contested this part of the decision and initiated legal proceedings. In February 2007, an injunction was issued preventing the museum from studying the remains any further. This was subsequently lifted after the museum said it would limit its tests. Researchers would no longer use "invasive" techniques such as DNA extraction or isotope analysis, the museum agreed. These procedures might have yielded insight into the Aborigines' genetic make-up, their diet and aspects of their culture. Under the agreement now reached, DNA samples from four of the remains will be preserved in Tasmania under the joint control of the NHM and the TAC. These samples were extracted from the remains before the decision was taken to return them. "We have to work with the TAC for a framework that allows scientists to have access [to the DNA samples]. We have no preconceptions about how that is going to work," Professor Lane said. TAC representative Greg Brown told BBC News: "Now we have some power and say over what happens. Nothing can happen to the DNA samples unless it has the joint approval of the parties. "There are a lot of sensitivities over the use of DNA by our people and we want to have control over what happens with that." He could not comment on what types of research the TAC might find offensive, but said decisions would be made in consultation with the whole community. Mr Brown added that aboriginal leaders believed the samples should eventually be buried. The TAC objects to testing because it desecrates the beliefs of its community. The dead are said to be "souls in torment" until properly buried, according to aboriginal custom. The Tasmanian materials were largely collected in the 19th Century by George Augustus Robinson, who had been contracted by the colonial government of the day to clear lands by force for European settlers. On his death, the remains were passed into the possession of other individuals and eventually deposited in UK institutions, and then gradually brought under the keeping of the Natural History Museum. Scientists in the UK say the Tasmanian remains could shed light on human evolution, and particularly on the colonisation of Australia. Tasmanian populations appear to have been isolated from mainland aboriginal Australians for 10,000 years until the arrival of Europeans in the 19th Century. According to the TAC, there were around 8,000 Aboriginals in Tasmania when the British settled the island in 1802, but by 1850 there were just 47 left, after thousands were killed in massacres and or by disease brought in by the colonists.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6616307.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Climate action 'needs devolution' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 4 May 2007, 08:23 GMT 09:23 UK E-mail this to a friend Climate action 'needs devolution' "Think global, act local" is the well-worn catchphrase to encourage people to cut their carbon emissions. But, as Matthew Spencer argues in this week's Green Room, there is little sign of local communities being given the powers they need in the battle against climate change. We can only tackle this global problem if we make climate change a very local issue Send us your comments It is a truism that all global climate change is local. Global carbon emission levels reflect the billions of small decisions taken on energy everyday in every town, village and city around the world. It's therefore strange that so little attention has been paid to the role of local decision-making in tackling climate change. Our politicians invest increasing amounts of political capital on international climate negotiations, and occasionally pay for national campaigns telling us "to do our bit", but they show little interest in supporting local decision-making on energy. This is because most of them don't believe it is necessary. The dominant view, expressed clearly by the Stern Report, is that a combination of international diplomacy, carbon pricing and incentives for technology investment will save us. But this approach misses one vital element: the personal motivation to act. You simply cannot regulate or innovate enough to tackle the problem without first stimulating a genuine desire to take action. The new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on mitigation confirms that social and behavioral issues are a major constraint on action to reduce carbon emissions. The Scottish Executive has been successful in implementing ambitious policies to support renewable energy There is powerful evidence of this from the last 10 years of UK climate policy, which demonstrates that many of us do not respond to pricing signals on energy efficiency, and that investment in renewable energy often does not translate into projects on the ground. The reasons are well known: individual motivations and local concerns come into play, and often block low carbon behaviour on energy. As a result, millions of pounds are wasted every year by consumers who are too busy to take up energy saving measures. It's also why the government's renewable targets will not be met as councils turn down many green energy schemes in favour of "local interests". We can only tackle this global problem if we make climate change a very local issue. At the moment it is seen as a distant and conceptual problem that is frequently trumped by short-term local and individual interests when it comes to the small decisions we all make on travel, heating and electric power. It is no coincidence that some of the strongest action on climate change has come from the places where the most power has been devolved to local decision makers. The Scottish Executive has been successful in implementing ambitious policies to support renewable energy and is now leading the UK on wind power, with strong public backing. The Mayor of London has used his planning power to shake up energy standards in new buildings, and is aiming for 60% cuts in carbon by 2025, 25 years ahead of the government's target. In Denmark, famous for its success in renewables, the political culture of strong local government has been critical to the development of energy service companies. A number of local councils in Britain use the powers they do have on planning to block renewable energy schemes The widespread use of high-efficiency heat networks in the major cities has been led by municipally owned energy supply companies. In the UK, the work of Woking and Merton councils on local energy is famous, but it is largely the result of strong-willed individuals with vision and determination who are prepared to work against the system to get things done. There is a huge gulf between this "best practice" and the rest. In fact, in the absence of clear responsibilities on climate change, a number of local councils in Britain use the powers they do have on planning to block renewable energy schemes. UK Communities Secretary Ruth Kelly has said she wants government to "get off the centralising tread mill", and wants climate change to be the first test of the new relationship between central and local government. In a recent speech on climate change, Mrs Kelly encouraged local councils to "step up to it" and "seize it", but it is not clear what she thinks "it" would look like if it was seized, and she provided no significant new powers or duties to local councils on carbon reduction. Ms Kelly should be working towards a major shift in responsibility from central to local government for tackling carbon emissions, rather than adopting a voluntary, incremental approach. Power to the people Councils need similar powers to the ones enjoyed by London's mayor In return for new powers, councils should have their funding directly linked to achieving challenging carbon reduction targets. The UK government's approach to climate change has been driven by outcomes, and largely ignores the services we need to live lower impact lives. Local authorities could change this by offering a new national climate service, providing free independent advice to householders and businesses on energy saving and renewable energy. The recent experience of DIY store B&Q's huge sales of micro-wind turbines suggests that some people's "willingness to pay" to tackle climate change is very high, and it is now the absence of clear authoritative advice, rather than financial incentives, that is often the biggest constraint to taking action. The Mayor of London is setting up a "Green Concierge" service to meet this need, and to negotiate favourable deals on energy technology for citizens. We need such a service in every local authority area in the UK. The UK government may not yet be convinced that supporting local decision-making is important in its own right, but if its renewed interest in devolution is translated into new powers and responsibilities for local government, we will greatly increase our capacity to respond to climate change. The competition we have seen for political leadership on climate change at a national level will be repeated in local government if councillors are given greater clout. Such leadership is essential if we are to close the gap between the gestures of big politics and what really happens on the ground.

They are now sending voice, images and other data over the Skynet 5A platform. The spacecraft, which was launched in March, is part of a £3.6bn project to upgrade the super-fast connections between command centres. "It's making a clear difference already," Brigadier Simon Shadbolt at the Ministry of Defence told BBC News. "In Afghanistan, where we've been using the system probably more than in Iraq, our troops have seen a noticeable increase in capability." Skynet 5A was launched from Kourou in French Guiana on 11 March. It is the first in what will eventually be a three-spacecraft constellation providing satcoms support to the Army, Royal Navy and RAF, wherever they might be operating across the globe. There was a huge sigh of relief when Skynet 5A went into orbit Malcolm Peto, Paradigm Secure Communications The spacecraft match the sophistication of the very latest civilian platforms used to pass TV, phone and internet traffic - but are "hardened" for military use. They incorporate novel antenna technology that will resist attempts to hijack or "jam" the platforms. Click here to see how the system will be deployed Skynet 5A together with its sister platforms, 5B and 5C (an in-orbit spare), provide two-and-a-half times the bandwidth capacity of the previous system. Over the course of the next few years, they will gradually take over the traffic currently passed through four Skynet 4 spacecraft. And it is expected Skynet 5 will experience heavy demand. Skynet 5A has been tested and pressed into service Information is now key to successful modern military operations. Good examples are the growth in the use of intelligence imagery and the rise of remote-controlled weapons. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) produce large volumes of still and moving pictures that need to be sent over networks for analysis and attack planning. Skynet will be particularly useful when the UK takes delivery of Predator B drones for use in Afghanistan. "Skynet gives us capacity - a two-and-a-half times capability enhancement; it's assured - commanders want to know they will get through each time they press the send button; and it's also resilient against computer-based threats," said Brigadier Shadbolt. The Ministry of Defence does not own the Skynet system; the military merely buys the services run over it from a company called Paradigm Secure Communications. This arrangement - the most expensive Private Finance Initiative (PFI) signed by the MoD - allows for spare bandwidth on the new satellites to be sold to "friendly" forces, earning money not just for Paradigm but for the defence department as well. Information is now key to successful modern military operations Paradigm is already providing services to Nato, France, Germany, Canada, Portugal and the Netherlands. It is actively seeking new business in the US, Australia and the Middle East. "There was a huge sigh of relief when Skynet 5A went into orbit because a huge lump of risk was retired. It was a job well done," said Malcolm Peto, managing director of Paradigm Secure Communications. "We're now looking forward to the launch of 5B towards the end of this year, and 5C around the middle of next year; full operational service will come in 2008."

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/scotland/south_of_scotland/6647545.stm	BBC NEWS | Scotland | South of Scotland | Red squirrel dies from deadly pox Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 16:58 GMT 17:58 UK E-mail this to a friend Red squirrel dies from deadly pox The squirrel was found displaying symptoms of the virus The first case of a red squirrel dying in Scotland as a result of the squirrel pox virus has been confirmed. The animal, which was displaying classic symptoms of the virus, was found near Lockerbie, Dumfries and Galloway, on Tuesday. The squirrel was euthanised following an examination at the South of Scotland Wildlife Hospital, Dumfries. Edinburgh vets then confirmed squirrel pox. The virus is carried by non-native grey squirrels. Conservationists have been working hard to try and stop the virus coming over the border into Scotland, and until now had been successful. We are very concerned about the spread of the virus into red squirrels in Scotland Intensive control measures have been in place since its presence in Scotland was first detected in invasive populations of grey squirrels in May 2005. Although the virus is fatal to red squirrels, greys remain unaffected by the disease. Scottish Natural Heritage currently has two grey squirrel control officers working in the south of Scotland. Professor Colin Galbraith, director of policy and advice at Scottish Natural Heritage, said: "SNH has been working with the Southern Upland Partnership to monitor the squirrel pox situation in grey squirrels in the south of Scotland for the past six months. "We were aware that the virus been found in a red squirrel less than a mile south of the border and had feared that, at some point, the disease would transfer to the red squirrels in Scotland. The red squirrels contract the virus from non-native grey squirrels "Targeted grey squirrel control in the area has undoubtedly delayed the progression of the disease to Scottish red squirrels and we will continue our intensive grey squirrel control in the affected areas to allow further time to investigate the development of a vaccine." He said the squirrel control officers would continue to monitor and test squirrels to minimise the spread of the disease. Local red squirrel conservation officer Ann-Marie MacMaster urged the public to report red or grey squirrels which appeared to be ill. "Once red squirrels develop lesions, they are extremely infectious," she said. "We would also ask people in the Lockerbie area especially not to encourage the two species of squirrel together through the use of feeders as this may facilitate the spread of the disease." Gordon Patterson, biodiversity policy adviser for the Forestry Commission Scotland, said: "We are very concerned about the spread of the virus into red squirrels in Scotland. "Our staff are already involved in the monitoring work and we will now look out with extra vigilance for any signs of diseased red squirrels in the area and report them to the project team." Tests on the squirrel's body were carried out at the Moredun Research Institute, Edinburgh. The red squirrel is one of the most threatened species of mammal in the UK with 75% (121,000 animals) of the population estimated to be found in Scotland. In February 2007, the Scottish Executive awarded a two-year contract to investigate the development of a vaccine against squirrel pox virus.

Supernovae occur when huge, mature stars effectively run out of fuel and collapse in on themselves. But scientists believe this one was obliterated in an explosion which blasted all its material into space. And astronomers say a star in our own galaxy could soon appear to blow apart with the same celestial fireworks. The supernova star, called SN 2006gy, was originally discovered in September last year. The explosion peaked for about 70 days, during which it is thought to have shone about five times more brightly than any supernova seen in the past. "Of all exploding stars ever observed, this was the king," Alex Filippenko, one of the Nasa-backed astronomers observing the phenomenon, said. Nathan Smith, who led a joint team from the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Texas in Austin, said it was a "truly monstrous explosion, a hundred times more energetic than a typical supernova". "That means the star that exploded might have been as massive as a star can get, about 150 times that of our Sun. We've never seen that before." Eta Carinae's explosion could be the best star-show in the history of modern civilization He said the explosion, which was located some 240 million light-years away, polluted the surrounding environment with metals and elements that are needed for life. Scientists say that the star which blew apart is similar to Eta Carinae, an enormous star in our own Milky Way, 7,500 light-years from Earth. They note that before SN 2006gy went supernova, it expelled a large amount of material. Telescopes now see something similar occurring at Eta Carinae, prompting speculation that this star could soon show up as a similar type of supernova. Dave Pooley, at the University of California at Berkeley, said if Eta Carinae were observed to explode "it would be so bright that you would see it during the day, and you could even read a book by its light at night". He added there had not been a supernova witnessed in the Earth's Milky Way galaxy for more than 400 years. Mario Livio, of the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, said that Eta Carinae could be seen to explode at any time. "We don't know for sure if Eta Carinae will explode soon, but we had better keep a close eye on it just in case," he was quoted by AFP as saying. "Eta Carinae's explosion could be the best star-show in the history of modern civilisation," he said. The latest SN 2006gy results will appear in the Astrophysical Journal. They incorporate observations from the Lick, Keck and Chandra observatories.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6645987.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Bandwidth leap for British forces Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 11 May 2007, 11:37 GMT 12:37 UK E-mail this to a friend Bandwidth leap for British forces Skynet 5 is already supporting operations in Afghanistan UK forces in Afghanistan and Iraq have started using a new satellite system that will see a dramatic improvement in their communications capability. They are now sending voice, images and other data over the Skynet 5A platform. The spacecraft, which was launched in March, is part of a £3.6bn project to upgrade the super-fast connections between command centres. "It's making a clear difference already," Brigadier Simon Shadbolt at the Ministry of Defence told BBC News. "In Afghanistan, where we've been using the system probably more than in Iraq, our troops have seen a noticeable increase in capability." Skynet 5A was launched from Kourou in French Guiana on 11 March. It is the first in what will eventually be a three-spacecraft constellation providing satcoms support to the Army, Royal Navy and RAF, wherever they might be operating across the globe. There was a huge sigh of relief when Skynet 5A went into orbit Malcolm Peto, Paradigm Secure Communications The spacecraft match the sophistication of the very latest civilian platforms used to pass TV, phone and internet traffic - but are "hardened" for military use. They incorporate novel antenna technology that will resist attempts to hijack or "jam" the platforms. Click here to see how the system will be deployed Skynet 5A together with its sister platforms, 5B and 5C (an in-orbit spare), provide two-and-a-half times the bandwidth capacity of the previous system. Over the course of the next few years, they will gradually take over the traffic currently passed through four Skynet 4 spacecraft. And it is expected Skynet 5 will experience heavy demand. Skynet 5A has been tested and pressed into service Information is now key to successful modern military operations. Good examples are the growth in the use of intelligence imagery and the rise of remote-controlled weapons. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) produce large volumes of still and moving pictures that need to be sent over networks for analysis and attack planning. Skynet will be particularly useful when the UK takes delivery of Predator B drones for use in Afghanistan. "Skynet gives us capacity - a two-and-a-half times capability enhancement; it's assured - commanders want to know they will get through each time they press the send button; and it's also resilient against computer-based threats," said Brigadier Shadbolt. The Ministry of Defence does not own the Skynet system; the military merely buys the services run over it from a company called Paradigm Secure Communications. This arrangement - the most expensive Private Finance Initiative (PFI) signed by the MoD - allows for spare bandwidth on the new satellites to be sold to "friendly" forces, earning money not just for Paradigm but for the defence department as well. Information is now key to successful modern military operations Paradigm is already providing services to Nato, France, Germany, Canada, Portugal and the Netherlands. It is actively seeking new business in the US, Australia and the Middle East. "There was a huge sigh of relief when Skynet 5A went into orbit because a huge lump of risk was retired. It was a job well done," said Malcolm Peto, managing director of Paradigm Secure Communications. "We're now looking forward to the launch of 5B towards the end of this year, and 5C around the middle of next year; full operational service will come in 2008." Ground control segments for the new system have been upgraded; and ships, planes and land vehicles are being equipped to make the best use of the upgraded Skynet.

But he says, in this week's Green Room, we also hold the key to solving these problems by attracting the brightest young minds into the world of science. It is easy in our day-to-day lives to believe we are detached from the wider environment, but that is an illusion Send us your comments Mankind has never had a greater need for science, and for the spark of human ingenuity to apply this to tackling today's great global challenges. Built on centuries of tradition and endeavour, the UK is second to none in the diversity and excellence of its scientific heritage. Our nation punches well above its weight in the quality and number of academic papers and citations, above Germany, France and Japan, and trailing only the far bigger economy of the US. It is vital therefore that we pay equal regard to ensuring that the UK's outstanding scientific outputs flow through to enhance the quality of life and prosperity for people in the UK, and beyond. The challenges facing science, and humanity, as we move through the 21st Century are manifold. I would place none higher than the test we face in our stewardship of planet Earth. Even with our best efforts, we must be prepared for further global temperature rise as a result of past emissions It is a stern test, as demonstrated by a few stark facts. From around three billion people on the planet in 1950, global population has risen to over six billion today. By the middle of this century, it will exceed nine billion. Most future population growth will be in the developing world, where people quite reasonably aspire to the living standards enjoyed today by "western societies", such as our own. Yet it is estimated that, even with today's population, we would need the resources of three planets for people across the world to imitate western lifestyles. I do not advocate a hairshirt future, but clearly we need to find new ways to develop both our lifestyles and the planet we share. Negative impacts will dominate in all regions, says Sir David It is easy in our day-to-day lives to believe we are detached from the wider environment, but that is an illusion. Climate change presents us with a particular stringent test, which unmitigated will magnify many of the existing scourges of mankind: famine, drought, flood, disease and conflict. The scientific evidence is compelling beyond any reasonable doubt that unless we very radically transform our economies to reduce greenhouse emissions to a fraction of current levels then future generations will reap a heavy price. Indeed, the signals are already with us of the sort of changes that we can expect to continue and accelerate, as land ice melts, sea levels rise and extreme weather events become more severe. Even with our best efforts, we must be prepared for further global temperature rise as a result of past emissions, and the climate impacts associated with this. The outcome will initially be mixed, with positive and negative effects depending where in the world you live and on other factors. But in time the negative impacts will dominate in all regions, and will fall earliest and heaviest on the poorest countries, which are least able to adapt and which have contributed least to the problem. Carbon levels in the atmosphere continue to rise It will take an unprecedented international effort if we are to avoid the most dangerous climate changes that are predicted, and for individual countries to adapt to those impacts it is already too late for us to avoid. From climate change I move to another linked challenge - energy. Since the industrial revolution, fossil fuels have powered our economies and brought new levels of prosperity. But by releasing into the atmosphere carbon, as carbon dioxide, that has been naturally sequestered underground over tens to hundreds of millions of years, we have raised concentration levels in the atmosphere in just 150 years beyond anything seen for at least one million years, and probably far longer. At the same time, world energy demand is expected to rise by half as much again by 2030. Even with a major push on energy efficiency, there is a critical need for step changes in the pace at which we deploy current low-carbon technologies in developed and developing countries alike; and we must quickly advance the more innovative technologies such as carbon capture and storage, wave and tidal power, and solar photovoltaics. There are no simple solutions and there is certainly no single "silver bullet" technological fix. The pathway for advancing new energy technologies to technical and economic viability at scale is complex, difficult and inevitably takes time, even with major efforts to accelerate progress. The £1bn public/private Energy Technology Institute, launched by the UK Government, is an important new initiative in this area, providing good starting levels of investment, focus and ambition, and I hope in time will develop as part of a global network of similar centres of excellence. There has never been a greater need for inquisitive and determined young minds to develop the solutions needed for the 21st Century Nor can we tackle the problem by focusing on one sector alone. It is not a question of whether we should reduce emissions from our vehicles, or our houses, or industry, or in aviation or shipping, or through curbing deforestation. The scale of the challenge is such that we must do all of these things, whilst using our actions as a stimulus to galvanise the wider international response. And we must continue to prosper, not just for our own sakes but because those we seek to influence will not follow our lead if they perceive that environmental sustainability means economic decline. It is a powerful demonstration that in the UK we have been able to grow our economy in real terms by around half since 1990, whilst greenhouse gas emissions have fallen by 15%. Action is affordable and is the pro-growth strategy. It is inaction that we cannot afford. Returning to where I began, science and technological innovation must be at the heart of the UK's approach as we tackle these and other of the great national and global challenges we face in the century ahead. But science does need to be redirected to meet these challenges. My message to any young person today mulling over their future career path is this: there has never been a better time to consider a future in scientific discovery; or in engineering to bring innovative technologies to real world application. And there has never been a greater need for inquisitive and determined young minds to develop the solutions needed for the 21st Century.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6616307.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Climate action 'needs devolution' Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Friday, 4 May 2007, 08:23 GMT 09:23 UK E-mail this to a friend Climate action 'needs devolution' "Think global, act local" is the well-worn catchphrase to encourage people to cut their carbon emissions. But, as Matthew Spencer argues in this week's Green Room, there is little sign of local communities being given the powers they need in the battle against climate change. We can only tackle this global problem if we make climate change a very local issue Send us your comments It is a truism that all global climate change is local. Global carbon emission levels reflect the billions of small decisions taken on energy everyday in every town, village and city around the world. It's therefore strange that so little attention has been paid to the role of local decision-making in tackling climate change. Our politicians invest increasing amounts of political capital on international climate negotiations, and occasionally pay for national campaigns telling us "to do our bit", but they show little interest in supporting local decision-making on energy. This is because most of them don't believe it is necessary. The dominant view, expressed clearly by the Stern Report, is that a combination of international diplomacy, carbon pricing and incentives for technology investment will save us. But this approach misses one vital element: the personal motivation to act. You simply cannot regulate or innovate enough to tackle the problem without first stimulating a genuine desire to take action. The new Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report on mitigation confirms that social and behavioral issues are a major constraint on action to reduce carbon emissions. The Scottish Executive has been successful in implementing ambitious policies to support renewable energy There is powerful evidence of this from the last 10 years of UK climate policy, which demonstrates that many of us do not respond to pricing signals on energy efficiency, and that investment in renewable energy often does not translate into projects on the ground. The reasons are well known: individual motivations and local concerns come into play, and often block low carbon behaviour on energy. As a result, millions of pounds are wasted every year by consumers who are too busy to take up energy saving measures. It's also why the government's renewable targets will not be met as councils turn down many green energy schemes in favour of "local interests". We can only tackle this global problem if we make climate change a very local issue. At the moment it is seen as a distant and conceptual problem that is frequently trumped by short-term local and individual interests when it comes to the small decisions we all make on travel, heating and electric power. It is no coincidence that some of the strongest action on climate change has come from the places where the most power has been devolved to local decision makers. The Scottish Executive has been successful in implementing ambitious policies to support renewable energy and is now leading the UK on wind power, with strong public backing. The Mayor of London has used his planning power to shake up energy standards in new buildings, and is aiming for 60% cuts in carbon by 2025, 25 years ahead of the government's target. In Denmark, famous for its success in renewables, the political culture of strong local government has been critical to the development of energy service companies. A number of local councils in Britain use the powers they do have on planning to block renewable energy schemes The widespread use of high-efficiency heat networks in the major cities has been led by municipally owned energy supply companies. In the UK, the work of Woking and Merton councils on local energy is famous, but it is largely the result of strong-willed individuals with vision and determination who are prepared to work against the system to get things done. There is a huge gulf between this "best practice" and the rest. In fact, in the absence of clear responsibilities on climate change, a number of local councils in Britain use the powers they do have on planning to block renewable energy schemes. UK Communities Secretary Ruth Kelly has said she wants government to "get off the centralising tread mill", and wants climate change to be the first test of the new relationship between central and local government. In a recent speech on climate change, Mrs Kelly encouraged local councils to "step up to it" and "seize it", but it is not clear what she thinks "it" would look like if it was seized, and she provided no significant new powers or duties to local councils on carbon reduction. Ms Kelly should be working towards a major shift in responsibility from central to local government for tackling carbon emissions, rather than adopting a voluntary, incremental approach. Power to the people Councils need similar powers to the ones enjoyed by London's mayor In return for new powers, councils should have their funding directly linked to achieving challenging carbon reduction targets. The UK government's approach to climate change has been driven by outcomes, and largely ignores the services we need to live lower impact lives. Local authorities could change this by offering a new national climate service, providing free independent advice to householders and businesses on energy saving and renewable energy. The recent experience of DIY store B&Q's huge sales of micro-wind turbines suggests that some people's "willingness to pay" to tackle climate change is very high, and it is now the absence of clear authoritative advice, rather than financial incentives, that is often the biggest constraint to taking action. The Mayor of London is setting up a "Green Concierge" service to meet this need, and to negotiate favourable deals on energy technology for citizens. We need such a service in every local authority area in the UK. The UK government may not yet be convinced that supporting local decision-making is important in its own right, but if its renewed interest in devolution is translated into new powers and responsibilities for local government, we will greatly increase our capacity to respond to climate change. The competition we have seen for political leadership on climate change at a national level will be repeated in local government if councillors are given greater clout. Such leadership is essential if we are to close the gap between the gestures of big politics and what really happens on the ground.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6632179.stm	BBC NEWS | Magazine | Portrait of a perfect murder Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Monday, 7 May 2007, 11:58 GMT 12:58 UK E-mail this to a friend Portrait of a perfect murder Most murderers are unaware of even the simplest clues that might give them away. But by thinking like a forensic scientist, is the "perfect" murder possible? The so-called perfect murder - an undetectable crime where the killer gets away scot free - has long been the stuff of mystery fiction. From the icicle to the leg of lamb, authors have strived to come up with more imaginative weapons and crimes than their predecessors. But would any of these ingenious methods work? Staging a death to look like an accident is one of the first things an aspiring murderer might try. But when a pathologist examines the body of the victim they're not just looking for the cause of death. Other minor injuries - like bruising from a struggle, or scratch marks where a body has been dragged - can reveal a murder. If you're dumping a body, of course you don't think where's the hypostasis, you just dump the body and run Another important clue is hypostasis. When someone dies their blood pressure falls, and gravity makes the blood pool in those regions of the body closest to the ground. This red staining is clearly visible, and can reveal the position of the body at death. If a body is found lying on its right-hand side, but the red staining due to hypostasis is down the left-hand side, then the body has clearly been moved. "It gives us a very important clue," says pathologist Dr Richard Shepherd. "If you're dumping a body, of course you don't think where's the hypostasis, you just dump the body and run." The body can reveal a lot of secrets, so a number of killers have tried to get rid of their victim's body altogether. In the 1940s the "acid bath murderer" John Haigh attempted to dissolve the bodies of six victims in sulphuric acid. This destroys bones and tissue but it can't digest fats - or plastic. This is how John Haigh was caught. A pair of dentures, a red plastic handbag, and three human gallstones - covered in a layer of fat - were retrieved from the acid sludge found at his workshop. One mistake and a killer is caught Another method of body disposal comes from forensic scientists themselves. DNA expert Eleanor Graham at the University of Leicester says: "It was developed for situations like the mass graves in Bosnia Herzegovina, where you find mostly skeletonised remains, but a bit of soft tissue adhering. "You need to clean these bones up and to preserve the DNA for identification purposes. The old systems included boiling at high temperatures which was extremely destructive to the DNA." What these scientists now do is simply heat the remains gently with biological washing powder. The biological enzymes eat away at the flesh, leaving just the bones behind. This would certainly make a murder more difficult to investigate but not impossible. Some people are more likely to deposit their DNA than other people Gunshot and knife wounds may still be visible on the bones, and any blow with a blunt instrument is likely to have shattered or cracked them. But there is a weapon that wouldn't leave visible evidence behind. It's the one professional assassins favour - poison. The victim may not even realise what's happened until the murderer is many miles away. The most recent example is Alexander Litvinenko's poisoning with polonium late last year. It took the investigators weeks to identify the poison, because polonium-210 had never been used in this way before. But what Litvinenko's poisoner may not have realised is that this ingenious poison might also give them away. The alpha radiation given out by polonium-210 can be detected in incredibly small quantities. As the poisoner escaped they were leaving behind a radioactive trail that may yet lead to their capture. This type of trace evidence is the final piece of the perfect murder puzzle. Modern crime scene investigators can spot much more than just fingerprints. The CSI team can pick up tiny fibres of clothing, shoeprints from a carpet, and of course DNA. The world's best detectives are one step ahead And Ms Graham says our DNA may actually make some of us better criminals than others. "Some people are more likely to deposit their DNA than other people. One person could pick up a bottle of water, put it down, you get a full profile. "Another one could drink from it and you wouldn't pick up very much. No one knows exactly why this is but there does seem to be a very big difference." So if someone sheds less DNA, that would reduce the risk of leaving tell-tale evidence. But that's also why the real-life "perfect" murder is likely to fail. It relies too heavily on chance. Every single element must come together perfectly. The forensic scientists need just one mistake and the criminal could be caught. If someone wants to get away with murder their best hope is to be very, very lucky. Horizon: How to commit the perfect murder is on BBC Two at 2100 BST on Tuesday 8 May A selection of your comments appears below. One of the American Mafia bosses had sign above his desk saying something like "the best secret is known by three men, and two of them are dead". The only way to commit a "perfect" murder is by conspiracy and to have bent cops on your side....there is always a mistake, or a link to the killer otherwise. The other way to do a perfect murder would be in a totally random way-like some kind of psycho, killing a stranger then leaving the country. Phil Harrington, Newport S Wales If you want to kill someone and get away with it; run them over. Many car-related crimes are unsolved and killing someone with a car is seen, in our society, as far less serious than doing so with a gun. Has anyone found the white Fiat that was in the underpass with Diana's Merc? The perfect murder was the execution of Charles I. The man had a mask on, there were no forensics then, and despite scores of witnesses, the killer was never even questioned. Nigel Macarthur, London, England Of course there may be thousands of perfect murders a year - the point being that if they are perfect murders then no-one will recognise them as such, they will be suicides, accidents or natural deaths. We therefore have no way of knowing quite how good current forensics are. Perfect Murder? Elvis Presley. Perfect murders happen all the time. Every unsolved murder, every missing person, perhaps. The greatest perfect murders have probably already happened because the police defined them suicides or accidents. So the perfect murder is one that one even thinks is a murder. If people think that shows like Quincy or CSI show how to commit a perfect murder then they are very much mistaken. Both shows are riddled with scientific errors even an A level student would see through. Regardless of forensic evidence, it's still possible to be convicted of murder even without a body being found. John Airey, Peterborough, UK I think that there is the "perfect" murder, but probably just by accident. JonBenet Ramsey is one example. Kara Tyson, Mobile, AL USA This is all very interesting, but is it really responsible journalism? Programs like CSI have already been accused of the "CSI effect" - and they're really just entertainment programs, so the details aren't always realistic or accurate. Even if people don't use your information to get away with crimes, they may think they'll be able to get away with crimes. Therefore, people might commit crimes they'd otherwise have not committed, because of fear of getting caught. There is some information that should be closely guarded - here, the benefit of the information is limited, whilst the potential cost is high. Ankush, get a grip. This article reveals very little, and probably nothing that couldn't be found in an introductory pathology text book. I think that this article is irresponsible. Isn't there enough crime and murders in the world without giving hints on how to create the perfect crime and avoid being caught?! Some people may read this article and find it interesting. However, what about the people who aren't of sound mind? Surely this puts ideas into their head. While I see merit in comments relating to copy-cat style happenings, if someone is willing to commit a murder, they will do it regardless of whether they read/saw something that would 'help' them. There is way too much finger-pointing going on in today's society, what is wrong with portraying an informative subject on a darker matter? It's much better than another show about driving decorated cars too fast or making way for another fickle reality show.

A Californian company has created software that can layer relevant recorded sounds over locations in Google Earth, New Scientist reports. Wild Sanctuary has over 3,500 hours of soundscapes from all over the world. The firm is in talks with Google, although no official agreement has yet been made. Its director, Bernie Krause said: "A picture tells a thousand words, but a sound tells a thousand pictures." Dr Krause has spent the last 40 years collecting sounds, and his recordings include more than 15,000 animal noises, and sounds from a huge array of habitats, including cities, deserts, mountains and the marine environment. It is the largest library in existence of natural sound, he said. He said the idea would be to zoom-in on a particular area and then have the option to listen to the accompanying sound. "It could be a real beneficial add-on," he said. The software is to be presented at the Where 2.0 conference in San Jose, California on 29 May. Mr Krause said up to two dozen sounds would be show-cased at first, but many more would be added later. If the project is successful, he would also like to use Google Earth show how sounds change with time. He said: "People will be able to get a sense of before and after. "For example, people are talking about how selective logging is an appropriate way of not harming the environment. "But we have evidence that from the sound perspective, selective logging has a profound effect on the natural world. The pictures of before and after look exactly the same, but the sound is completely different."

The immense, 50m-long vehicle powered away from Kourou in French Guiana at 1929 local time (2229 GMT). The Astra 1L and Galaxy 17 platforms it put in space will deliver TV and other services to Europe and North America. Friday's mission represented the second launch of the year for the Ariane 5 and its 32nd flight overall. The launch was delayed by a day because of poor weather over the spaceport on Thursday. The rocket is the workhorse of Europe's commercial launch service, operated by the French-based Arianespace company. In its heavy-lift, or ECA, configuration, the vehicle produces 13,000 kilonewtons of thrust at launch - equivalent to 20 Concorde jets at take-off. Watching the launch in Kourou was US space agency (Nasa) Administrator Dr Mike Griffin. The Nasa chief came to see the rocket that will begin to supply the International Space Station later this year. Europe is preparing a new cargo ship called the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), which will carry 7.5 tonnes of experimental equipment, spare parts, food, air and water to astronauts working on the orbiting outpost. The ATV is designed to ride into space on top of an Ariane 5.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6644697.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Galileo firms miss key deadline Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Thursday, 10 May 2007, 22:25 GMT 23:25 UK E-mail this to a friend Galileo firms miss key deadline The Galileo spacecraft would be launched in batches The private consortium asked to run Europe's satellite navigation system, Galileo, has missed a key EU deadline for moving the project forward. The European Commission (EC) said the companies had made "insufficient progress", resulting in unacceptable delays and risks for public finances. This is likely to mean European taxpayers stepping in to cover an advance payment for construction costs. The EC is expected to present new plans to overhaul the project on 16 May. These will be sent for approval by the EU's transport ministers in June. The consortium comprises leading aerospace and telecom concerns: EADS, Thales, Inmarsat, Alcatel-Lucent, Finmeccanica, AENA, Hispasat, and TeleOp. The Commission set a 10 May deadline for them to come forward with a single company structure to run Galileo, a chief executive and common position from which to negotiate with EU representatives over the future of the project. On Thursday, the Commission announced that the target had not been met to its satisfaction. Michele Cercone, spokesman for the EC's directorate general for transport, said the Commission now intended to propose "different scenarios to put Galileo on the right track again". Galileo's planned network of 30 satellites will beam radio signals to receiving devices on the ground, helping users pinpoint their locations. The system's technologies are designed to bring greater accuracy and reliability to navigation and timing signals delivered from space. A European Commission and European Space Agency project 30 satellites to be launched in batches by end of 2011-12 Will work alongside US GPS and Russian Glonass systems Promises real-time positioning down to less than a metre Guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances Suitable for safety-critical roles where lives depend on service Europe lofts Galileo satellite Q&A: Europe's Galileo project Galileo puts UK on map The original intention behind Galileo was that taxpayers in the EU would inject more than one billion euros (£0.7bn) into the early development of the project. The deployment phase - the launch of the satellites and the construction of ground stations - was expected to cost at least two billion more, with two-thirds of the investment being borne by the private sector. The latter was also expected to pick up all the running costs in the long term. The first demonstrator spacecraft, Giove-A, is already in orbit. A second, Giove-B, which has had some technical problems, should be in orbit by the year's end. The contract for the first four satellites proper in the final constellation was awarded at the end of 2004, but the time has now come to order the remaining 26. It should be the private concession making this spacecraft order - but with no progress on its formal establishment, it seems certain that European taxpayers will now have to shoulder a greater burden of the construction costs if Galileo is to stay on track. Mr Cercone said this option would be better for Europe's taxpayers in the long run. He likened the alternative options to the difference between leasing a car and buying one. "When you lease a car you pay less at the start, but it turns out more expensive in the end. When you buy a car for cash, you have to come up with the money sooner, but overall the car will cost less," he told a press briefing in Brussels. "If you apply this example to Galileo, it is less expensive to take on the entire construction of the infrastructure than it would be to guarantee for 100% a private loan at market value, as is the plan of the consortium." Under consortium proposals, public money would be used to guarantee the risks and debts of the project. But Mr Cercone said using public money to cover construction costs offered the best value for money and would protect taxpayers. Galileo was supposed to have started launching its 30 satellites by 2008. However, that date was postponed to 2011/12 due to previous disagreements between EU governments on how to pay for the system.

The US space agency Nasa has unveiled a model of a space telescope that scientists say will be able to see to the farthest reaches of the Universe. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is intended to replace the ageing Hubble telescope. It will be larger than its predecessor, sit farther from Earth and have a giant mirror to enable it to see more. Officials said the JWST - named after a former Nasa administrator - was on course for launch in June 2013. The full-scale model is being displayed outside the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in the US capital, Washington DC. It was recently shown off in Seattle at the American Astronomical Society meeting. The $4.5bn (£2.3bn) telescope will take up a position some 1.5 million km (930,000 miles) from Earth. It will measure 24m (80ft) long by 12m (40ft) high and incorporate a hexagonal mirror 6.5m (21.3ft) in diameter, almost three times the size of Hubble's. Hubble, launched in 1990, has sent back pictures of our solar system, distant stars, and remote fledgling galaxies formed not long after the Big Bang. But scientists say the JWST will enable them to look deeper into space and even further back at the origins of the Universe. "Clearly we need a much bigger telescope to go back much further in time to see the very birth of the Universe," said Edward Weiler, director of Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Centre. Martin Mohan of Northrop Grumman, the contractor building the telescope, said that the team was making excellent progress. "There's engineering to do, but invention is done, more than six years ahead of launch," he said. When ready, the JWST will be launched by a European Ariane 5 rocket. It is expected to have a 10-year lifespan. Until then, the 17-year-old Hubble telescope will continue to do its work. Nasa plans to send astronauts on the space shuttle to service it in 2008. THE JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE JWST is named after James E Webb, Nasa Administrator during the Apollo lunar exploration era; he served from 1961 to 1968 It will be placed 1.5m km from Earth, at Lagrange Point 2, an area of gravitational balance that keeps it in a Sun-Earth line The telescope will be shaded from sunlight by a shield, enabling it to stay cold, increasing its sensitivity to infrared radiation Three principal instruments will gather images of the Universe in the infrared region of the spectrum These will yield new information about how stars and galaxies first formed a few hundred million years after the Big Bang E-mail this to a friend Telescope mirror nears completion 08 Feb 07 | Science/Nature First stars in telescope's sights 12 Jan 07 | Science/Nature Large camera delights astronomers 10 Nov 03 | Science/Nature The BBC is not responsible for the content of external internet sites Pope creates Brazil's first saint UK police face no action on shooting Nasa unveils Hubble's successor MOST POPULAR STORIES NOW Google searches web's dark side Confused penguin strays 5,000km Vultures pick off human body farm Nasa unveils Hubble's successor Floyd play at Barrett tribute gig Most popular now, in detail Confused penguin strays 5,000km Madeleine parents 'won't give up' Google searches web's dark side Two dead children were murdered Brown makes pitch to lead Britain Most popular now, in detail Locals believe police are doing all they can to find Madeleine Historic visit to the Boyne points way to the future How will history judge Tony Blair's war record?

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6636467.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | UN warns on impacts of biofuels Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Wednesday, 9 May 2007, 08:16 GMT 09:16 UK E-mail this to a friend UN warns on impacts of biofuels Plantations for biofuels may threaten forests and wildlife A UN report warns that a hasty switch to biofuels could have major impacts on livelihoods and the environment. Produced by a cross-agency body, UN Energy, the report says that biofuels can bring real benefits. But there can be serious consequences if forests are razed for plantations, if food prices rise and if communities are excluded from ownership, it says. And it concludes that biofuels are more effective when used for heat and power rather than in transport. "Current research concludes that using biomass for combined heat and power (CHP), rather than for transport fuels or other uses, is the best option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the next decade - and also one of the cheapest," it says. The European Union and the US have recently set major targets for the expansion of biofuels in road vehicles, for which ethanol and biodiesel are seen as the only currently viable alternative to petroleum fuels. The UN report, Sustainable Bioenergy: A Framework for Decision Makers, suggests that biofuels can be a force for good if they are planned well, but can bring adverse consequences if not. "The development of new bioenergy industries could provide clean energy services to millions of people who currently lack them," it concludes, "while generating income and creating jobs in poorer areas of the world." Intensive farming of energy crops demands water and resources But the prices of food, land and agricultural commodities could be driven up, it warns, with major impacts in poorer countries where people spend a much greater share of their incomes on food than in developed nations. On the environmental side, it notes that demand for biofuels has accelerated the clearing of primary forest for palm plantations, particularly in southeast Asia. This destruction of ecosystems which remove carbon from the atmosphere can lead to a net increase in emissions. The report warns too of the impacts on nature: "Use of large-scale mono-cropping could lead to significant biodiversity loss, soil erosion and nutrient leaching." This has been avoided, the report says, in the Brazilian state of Sao Paulo where sugar cane farmers are obliged to leave a percentage of their land as natural reserves. Water is also a concern. The expanding world population and the on-going switch towards consumption of meat and dairy produce as incomes rise are already putting pressure on freshwater supplies, which increased growing of biofuel crops could exacerbate. In conclusion, UN Energy suggests policymakers should take a holistic look before embarking on drives to boost biofuel use. "Only through a convergence of biodiversity, greenhouse gas emissions and water-use policies can bioenergy find its proper environmental context and agricultural scale," the report concludes.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/go/rss/-/1/hi/sci/tech/6640271.stm	BBC NEWS | Science/Nature | Tiny marsupial records DNA first Skip to bbc.co.uk navigation Your news when you want it Wednesday, 9 May 2007, 18:00 GMT 19:00 UK E-mail this to a friend Tiny marsupial records DNA first The small creature is normally found in the trees of South America The grey, short-tailed opossum has become the first marsupial to have its DNA read through by scientists. The creature is commonly used in labs as an experimental "model" in which to study the causes of human disease, such as cancer and neurological problems. Knowing its genome will boost those efforts, and give new insight into the different evolutionary paths taken by marsupial and placental mammals. Details of the work appear in the journals Nature and Genome Research. The study is part of a grand scheme to compare the biochemistry of a range of animals with that of , to understand better how the human body is built and maintained, and how all species differ from one another. "The idea is to obtain genome sequence information from organisms that are appropriately spaced relative to us on the tree of life," explained Adam Felsenfeld, from the US National Human Genome Research Institute. "For example, by lining up the sequences it is possible to detect regions of the genome that have not changed, so are conserved and perhaps important; or, alternatively, regions that are changing very rapidly." In the wild, the opossum is found in the trees of South America. It was chosen as a subject to have its full complement of DNA (its genome) decoded because of its current importance to science. Its small size, ease of breeding and large litters have made the creature the predominant marsupial for laboratory study worldwide. The double-stranded DNA molecule is held together by four chemical components scientists refer to as bases Adenine (A) bonds with thymine (T); cytosine(C) bonds with guanine (G) Groupings of these "letters" form the "code of life"; there are about 3.4 billion base-pairs in the opossum genome Written in this DNA sequence are about 18-20,000 genes Genes are starting templates used by cells to make proteins; the sophisticated molecules that build and maintain the body Marsupial mammals (kangaroos, wallabies, etc) are closely related to the placental mammals (humans, mice, etc) - but not that close. They last shared a common ancestor about 180 million years ago and have arrived at very different reproductive solutions - with marsupials rearing their young externally, sometimes in a pouch. "This marsupial is a bit different in that the young are not kept in a pouch; they just dangle off the teats," observed Jenny Graves from the Australian National University. This open arrangement makes the study of early developmental processes much simpler, and should give scientists clues as to how they perform a number of very clever biological tricks. For example, when newborns crawl to their mother's teats, they are little more than a mouth and gut. They have no functioning immune system but are still able to survive in an open, "dirty" environment. Looking at the genes should help scientists work out how this is possible. Research has also shown that newborns can regrow their spinal cords, even if they are completely severed. "The genome hasn't told us exactly how they do that but the genome provides us with a blueprint for further study and for being able to apply some of that knowledge to humans," commented Chris Gunter, a senior biology editor at Nature. The decoding work, led by the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard in Cambridge, Massachusetts, reveals the opossum to have between 18,000 and 20,000 protein-coding genes. The number is a little short of what is seen in a placental mammal like a human - but broadly similar. The big difference, scientists say, is in the DNA sequences that are responsible for regulation of the genes - controlling when and where in cell processes they become active. "Twenty percent of all the regulatory instructions in the human genome were invented after we parted ways with the marsupial," explained Eric Lander, the director of the Broad Institute. "Evolution is tinkering much more with the controls than with the genes themselves." Many of these innovative DNA instructions were derived from so-called "jumping genes", or transposons - small pieces of genetic code that hop around the genome and were previously thought to have no function. "Transposons have a restless lifestyle, often shuttling themselves from one chromosome to another," said Broad researcher Tarjei Mikkelsen. "It is now clear that in their travels, they are disseminating crucial genetic innovations around the genome."
