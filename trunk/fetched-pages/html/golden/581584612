Deputies gave few details early Friday, but neighbors said a distraught man had wounded his estranged wife, killed her parents and committed suicide Thursday evening in a small wooden house a few hundred yards from the nearest dwellings. Sheriff's Sgt. Derek Dofelmire told The Associated Press the survivor was Rose Turner and one of the dead was Ricky Turner. He would not identify the elderly man and woman. Rose Turner was "very lucky" to be alive and was flown to Sacred Heart Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., where "she has been able to provide information to our investigators," Dofelmire said. More than one gun was recovered at the scene, he added. Shoshone and Benewah deputies closed a road off U.S. Forest Service Road 50, the St. Joe River Road, in the Idaho Panhandle about two miles east of Calder and 65 miles east-southeast of Spokane. Neighbors told The Spokesman-Review of Spokane and KXLY and KREM Television that Ricky Turner is Rose Turner's estranged husband and committed suicide after shooting her and her parents. The Turners had three children, Ricky Turner was disabled, Rose Turner worked at a nursing home and her parents lived with her at the house, one neighbor, Julie "Tiny" Codoni, told the newspaper. She said Ricky Turner was despondent over their divorce, which was scheduled to take effect Thursday. When she talked to him Wednesday, "he was in really bad shape. He was hurting," Codoni said. "He loved her. She was his life." &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(AP) -- A Pierce County jury has acquitted a man accused of having sex with the family dog. Michael Patrick McPhail, 26, of Spanaway, was found not guilty Wednesday in Pierce County Superior Court of first-degree animal cruelty. Assistant Pierce County Prosecutor Karen Watson said last fall that McPhail was the first person charged in the county under a new state law that made bestiality a felony. "I'm glad that justice was able to see it wasn't an action of my doing," McPhail said as he left the court building. He said he believes his wife made up the story because she is seeking to end their marriage. It was Jesika McPhail who contacted police and told them she'd caught her husband engaged in sexual intercourse with their pit bull, Sara, last October. Jesika McPhail was not immediately available for comment about the verdict. The case generated outrage among animal welfare advocates across the globe, many of whom called for McPhail to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Deputy Prosecutor Brian Leech, who tried the case, said he was disappointed. "Obviously, I thought the facts were more than sufficient to merit a conviction," Leech said. "The defense was able to introduce some evidence about strife in the marriage. I don't think that was supported, but apparently the jury gave it some weight." The new law, which took effect last June, was prompted by a case in which a Seattle man died after having sex with a horse. Before the law was enacted, Washington was among roughly a dozen states where bestiality had not been explicitly prohibited. Information from: The News Tribune, &copy; 2007 The Associated Press.

But he said he doesn't know if that's why McKay was placed on a list of U.S. attorneys to be fired in March 2005. Testifying before the House Judiciary Committee in the nation's capital, Gonzales also said he didn't know if McKay might have been fired because he pushed for appropriate resources to investigate the slaying of Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Wales. Kyle Sampson, Gonzales' former chief of staff and the person who compiled the list of prosecutors to be fired, raised the possibility in a closed-door interview with congressional investigators last month that McKay made the list for pushing too hard on the Wales investigation, from which his office is recused. McKay has called that suggestion "mind-numbing." Wales was shot to death as he worked in his basement the night of Oct. 11, 2001. "If that was a reason why he was included as part of the recommended group, that's something you'd have to ask others involved in this process," Gonzales said in response to questioning from Rep. Mel Watt, D-N.C. "I'm not aware the department, however, is using that as a reason or excuse." Gonzales said he learned about concerns related to the Wales case "very, very recently." "Yeah, he wasn't aware of it until Kyle Sampson made it up," McKay said after learning of the attorney general's comments. Watt pressed Gonzales on whether the real reason McKay made the list were allegations that he should have brought claims of election fraud in the 2004 election, won after two recounts by Democrat Chris Gregoire, to a grand jury. Gonzales said he doesn't recall such concerns being in his mind when he agreed to fire McKay. "I don't recall that when I accepted the recommendation that that was a reason for it, was his efforts with respect to voter fraud," Gonzales said. "But clearly, going back and looking at the documents, there was a great deal of concern with his efforts with respect to voter fraud because I received a number of letters from groups and outside parties ...." Watt interrupted: "So you didn't fire him for that reason, but somebody might have put him on the list for that reason. That's really what you're saying, Mr. Attorney General." "I'm assuming that this committee has spoken with everyone who provided input, and of course the person who was compiling the information, Mr. Sampson, would know better than I," Gonzales replied. Watt started his questioning by noting that in testimony on April 19, Gonzales said McKay was fired for the way he pursued an information-sharing project and for comments he made to the Seattle Post-Intelligencer citing his concerns about budget cuts and unfilled positions in his office. In reality, McKay's appearance on the March 2005 hit list long predated those issues, which didn't arise until last summer. "Are you aware of any legitimate reason that John McKay should have been forced out as a United States attorney in March 2005, as opposed to the things you talked about that occurred in 2006?" Watt asked. "I would have to go back and look at that, U.S. Rep.," Gonzales said. Gonzales agreed that it would be improper if McKay were pressured to bring an unwarranted election fraud investigation, but also suggested there might have been some legitimacy to the claims raised by GOP groups in the state. He said his office did receive several letters complaining about McKay. At a Seattle University Law School forum on Wednesday, McKay said he himself had concerns about the state's conduct of the 2004 election. But there was absolutely no actual evidence of fraud, he said. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

(AP) -- Energy Northwest has asked the state to delay its permitting review of a proposed $1.5 billion power plant in Kalama following passage of a new climate change bill. Gov. Chris Gregoire last week signed the bill into law, barring Washington utilities from signing long-term contracts with coal-fired power plants that produce excessive greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane and other gases, essentially trap energy from the sun, which warms the Earth's surface and lower atmosphere. Many scientists believe human activity that increases those gases is contributing to global warming. Energy Northwest, a public power consortium based in Richland, Wash., asked the state Energy Facility Site Evaluation Council in a letter Tuesday to delay its permitting process. The consortium said it wants to wait and see how regulators plan to limit heat-trapping gases. "We don't mean to signal in any way we're walking away from the project," Energy Northwest spokesman Brad Peck said. "We're as committed to this project as the day it started." The new law directs state and federal agencies, electric utilities and "public interest representatives" to write regulations limiting emissions such as carbon dioxide. The state must adopt the rules by June 30, 2008. Energy Northwest urged state regulators to try to adopt the rules by midsummer so it can decide whether to forge ahead or abandon its proposed 680-megawatt coal gasification plant. The project would use coal or petcoke, the waste product from oil refineries, that would be turned into a gas to be burned to generate power. The plant could also burn natural gas. The new law allowed projects like the proposed plant five years to "sequester" carbon dioxide emissions underground. Otherwise, emissions would have to be offset through drastic measures, such as buying a dirty power plant and shutting it down. Energy Northwest has been participating in a study to inject emissions into basalt, which is common in the region. But the utility said it isn't sure five years will be enough time to determine the feasibility of that technique. Moreover, either option for curbing greenhouse gas emissions could significantly increase the cost of power from the project. Energy Northwest wants to know how the law will be implemented before it takes the project to potential customers for financial commitments. Given the uncertainty surrounding implementation of the law and the time required to build major power generation plants, "we must immediately begin looking at alternative options for regional power supplies," Energy Northwest Vice President Jack Baker wrote in the letter. Environmentalists say the delay request could be the beginning of the end for the project. "I think it's a prudent move on their part," said Marc Krasnowsky, a spokesman for the Northwest Energy Coalition. "I think they've concluded their public utility customers are likely to be spending a lot more for the power from the proposed plant than they had expected to." Energy Northwest, which includes 20 public utilities and municipalities, operates a nuclear power plant near Richland and a hydropower project, as well as wind, solar and biomass power projects. The state energy council is in the midst of a year-plus review of the application for the proposed plant. The council then makes a recommendation to the governor, who has the final say on whether large power plants are approved. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

(AP) -- Heritage University celebrates its 25th graduating class Saturday, a milestone for the Yakima Valley's first four-year college - created by three women to improve educational opportunities for the region's multicultural population. Kathleen Ross, the school's president since it began offering undergraduate and graduate degrees in 1982, called the silver anniversary "a glorious milestone" that represents a wave of graduates who have ventured out to build the future. She also said the milestone signifies that "we can think even more creatively and expansively for the next 25 years." Originally known as Heritage College, the school was founded in 1981 by Ross, a Catholic nun, and two Yakama Nation tribal members as a successor to Spokane's Fort Wright College. The school began offering degrees a year later as an independent, nonprofit college with only a handful of students and staff and a few modest buildings and trailers surrounded by hops fields about 20 miles southeast of Yakima. The school became Heritage University in August 2004. Enrollment has grown to more than 1,500 students, and the school has regional sites in several cities, including Yakima, Omak, Wenatchee and Moses Lake. From the beginning, the mission has been to bring a quality liberal arts education to a multicultural population. Some 6,000 degrees have been conferred since the school's founding. At Saturday's commencement, 374 degrees will be awarded. "This is celebrating 25 years of support and generosity from the community and bringing education to people who couldn't ordinarily afford it," said Bill Rich, a retired Yakima businessman and member of the university board of directors. "Heritage has been an outstanding success, and the best is yet to come," he said. Heritage extends undergraduate degrees in business, the humanities, computer science, scientific disciplines, nursing, education, psychology, math and social work. Graduate degrees are also available. At the conclusion of commencement Saturday, the Class of 2007 will release white doves to commemorate the anniversary. Graduates say it's a fitting metaphor for a school that has risen above all expectations. Special events also have been planned throughout the year to highlight the anniversary.

Fourth St. • Joplin, MO 64801 • (417) 623-3480 • (800) 444-8514 • Fax [417] 623-8450 9 Days in Haiti Advertise with The Globe May 11, 8:50 AM EDT Marriage and divorce rates at two-decade low in Washington state SEATTLE (AP) -- Marriage and divorce rates are at a two-decade low in Washington state, and experts are divided on the reason. The state recorded fewer divorces in 2004 than in 1986 despite a 1.7 million population increase, and that's in line with a national trend. The nation's divorce rate, which shot upward following the widespread adoption of state no-fault divorce laws starting in the 1960s to a peak of 5.3 divorces per 1,000 people in 1981, has since fallen to 3.6. In Washington the decline from 1986 to 2004 was from 5.9 to 4.2. "If you have fewer marriages, you are going to have fewer divorces.," said Pepper Schwartz, a University of Washington sociologist. More couples now live together without getting married, and "you can't get divorced unless you are married," Schwartz said. Others note that many couples wait longer to get married, so they have more time to mature and get to know each other. The result, some say, is more durable marriages. Other marriage experts cite a "divorce divide," saying divorce rates are falling substantively among college-educated couples but not among less affluent and less educated couples. "Families with two earners with good jobs have seen an improvement in their standard of living, which leads to less tension at home and lower probability of divorce," said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy at Johns Hopkins University. "People are getting married later now than they ever have, and cohabitation is on the rise," said Les Parrott, co-founder of the Center for Relationship Development at Seattle Pacific University. "So many (young couples) are feeling unprepared for it. They've seen plenty of examples of how marriage doesn't work, so they put it off." With a long engagement, "the couple gets along better," said Heather Edy, owner of Wedding Bell Bliss Bridal Consultation in Seattle. "I truly believe they're more compatible for marriage." Edy, 28, is a fair example. In August she plans to marry Clint Sharpe, 30, whom she has dated for four years and to whom she got engaged on Valentine's Day last year. Nikelle Rosier, a marriage educator and couples therapist in Seattle, said her clients are displaying "more intentionality" in marriage decisions. "What's interesting is that a lot of clients met through Match.com," she said. "They're picking a mate more out of compatibility than just coming across someone and falling in love." Shifting gender roles and expectations also are involved, said Stephanie Coontz, who teaches history and family studies at The Evergreen State College in Olympia. Marriages in the 1950s and '60s were typically based on "pre-assigned" roles of the husband as provider and the wife as mother, she said. "In the last 20 years, people are marrying now as peers with more options outside marriage," Coontz said. "It's more necessary than it used to be to have a very deep friendship and to have good negotiating skills." The "big irony," she said, is that "the very fact that people have options outside marriage in many ways makes them think more carefully about commitment before they do get married." And then there's the aging of baby boomers. "As you're getting older, the less likelier you are of getting divorced," Schwartz said. "You're less likely to run off in your 60s than in your 40s."

(AP) -- A preschooler called 911 and said, "mom and daddy go bye bye," helping to lead authorities to the discovery of three young children alone in a trash-strewn house with drug paraphernalia. Jennifer K. Rigutto, 34, the mother of two of the children, was arrested when she showed up Thursday after a gambling trip, police Officer William Hager said. She was held for investigation of three counts of child endangerment and one of possession of methamphetamine with intent to deliver, Hager said. The children were taken into custody by state Child Protective Services workers after being alone for as long as four hours. The case arose after child protection workers called the house for a welfare check about 8:45 a.m. Thursday and one of the children answered the phone, Police Lt. Darrell Toombs said. As CPS workers headed to the home, one of the children called 911 and said, "mom and daddy go bye-bye," Hager said. Officers dispatched to the scene were retrieving baby clothes from the master bedroom when they found methamphetamine and requested a search warrant, police said. Rigutto told authorities she left the two boys and a girl, ages 4, 3 and 2, with her ex-husband, William "Shad" Smith, 35, about 5 a.m. to go gambling with her boyfriend. "I would never, never leave my children alone," Rigutto said. Smith was arrested Thursday evening as he was boarding a transit bus and was jailed for investigation of three counts of second-degree child abandonment, Hager said. Police were seeking Rigutto's boyfriend, Michael S. Perry, 30, who also lives at the home and recently was granted custody of his 3-year-old son, who was one of the children in the house, Hager said. The house reeked of unwashed laundry, and the floors apparently had not been swept in weeks with trash thick enough to hinder walking from room to room, Toombs said. Detective John Willard, who specializes in cases involving drug-endangered children, said he had seen worse. "I've been in houses where you come out every five to 10 minutes so you can breathe," Willard said. "It was filthy, not terrible."

The money, which will be distributed by Oxfam America, is intended to help the people whose homes were destroyed by hurricanes Katrina and Rita and those who have been employed to work on the cleanup. "During the past year and a half, we have seen how many of the Gulf Coast's neediest residents have been denied the resources they need to rebuild their lives - and how the low-wage workers who are making the rebuilding effort possible have been exploited," Raymond C. Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, said in a statement. He said Oxfam works with local community leaders who are advocating for change in Louisiana and Mississippi. "Inequities that existed before the devastating hurricanes of 2005 have become even more pronounced and new ones have arisen," said Hilary Pennington, director of special initiatives for the Gates Foundation. "This investment, although outside the scope of our usual giving, reflects the enormity of the crisis and our desire to support local organizations so they can grow in expertise and influence." Since 2005, the Gates Foundation has also given money to help displaced students, and refurbish and rebuild libraries on the Gulf Coast. The foundation gives a majority of its grants in the areas of world health, global development and education. &copy; 2007 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
