The advertisements, conceived by the promotional arm of the dairy industry and overseen by the Agriculture Department, feature slogans like &#8220;Milk your . Lose weight!&#8221; and suggest that three servings of dairy products a day can help people be slim. The effort includes a campaign called &#8220;Body by Milk&#8221; that is aimed at teenagers. It features Alex Rodriguez, the third baseman for the New York Yankees, and Carrie Underwood, an &#8220;American Idol&#8221; winner. The assertion that there is a link between weight loss and dairy consumption has long been contested by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy and research group that promotes a diet free of animal products. The group petitioned the F.T.C. in 2005 to argue that the advertisements were misleading. In a May 3 letter to the group, Lydia Parnes, director of the agency&#8217;s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Agriculture Department representatives and milk producers and processors had agreed to change the advertisements and related marketing materials &#8220;until further research provides stronger, more conclusive evidence of an association between dairy consumption and weight loss.&#8221; As of Thursday, the National Dairy Council still had a section of its Web site devoted to the weight-loss claim. But the site, along with some of the advertisements, will be changed, said Greg Miller, who is executive vice president of the council and has a doctorate in nutrition. &#8220;Like any other marketing campaign, after time you want to freshen them up and give the consumers what&#8217;s new,&#8221; Mr. Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.&#8221; Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the group that brought the matter to the F.T.C., said it would continue to press the dairy industry on other claims, which include the assertion that calcium helps prevent bone fractures in older women. &#8220;I think people will start to recognize that the dairy industry, which used to have a mom-and-pop image, is a huge commercial entity that will exaggerate to sell its products,&#8221; Dr. Barnard said. Mr. Miller said most medical professionals agreed that dairy contributed to overall bone health and could help people maintain a healthy weight. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a minority of people out there that just have very loud voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a vegan group that doesn&#8217;t want anyone to eat dairy.&#8221; Dairy products were upgraded in the 2005 revision of federal dietary guidelines, which recommended that people consume more low-fat milk and dairy products. An advisory committee that helped set the guidelines cited a report, partly financed by the dairy industry, which found that low-fat dairy products did not necessarily add to weight gain and that dairy products have certain nutrients that can help consumers meet dietary recommendations. The guidelines increased the amount of low-fat or fat-free dairy products to three cups a day, up from two cups. The dairy council is allowed to continue to use wording from those guidelines that says adults and children should not avoid milk and milk products because of concerns that they may lead to weight gain, the letter from the F.T.C. said. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at , said the agreement to modify the advertisements was groundbreaking. In her book, &#8220;What to Eat,&#8221; she argued that lobbying by the $50 billion dairy industry could sometimes cloud policy on nutrition. Though Ms. Nestle said she ate dairy products regularly and did not dispute their nutritional value, she said people could have a healthy diet without them. &#8220;Those ads were ridiculously misleading,&#8221; she said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/health/10psyche.html	Psychiatrists, Children and Drug Industry&#8217;s Role - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior Psychiatrists, Children and Drug Industry’s Role Fabrizio Costantini for The New York Times Anya Bailey is among a growing number of children given antipsychotic drugs by doctors who are paid by the makers of those drugs. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This By GARDINER HARRIS, BENEDICT CAREY and JANET ROBERTS Published: May 10, 2007 When Anya Bailey developed an after her 12th birthday, her mother took her to a psychiatrist at the who prescribed a powerful antipsychotic drug called Risperdal. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times , Risperdal is not approved to treat eating disorders, but increased appetite is a common side effect and doctors may prescribe drugs as they see fit. Anya gained weight but within two years developed a crippling knot in her back. She now receives regular injections of Botox to unclench her back muscles. She often awakens crying in pain. Isabella Bailey, Anya’s mother, said she had no idea that children might be especially susceptible to Risperdal’s side effects. Nor did she know that Risperdal and similar medicines were not approved at the time to treat children, or that medical trials often cited to justify the use of such drugs had as few as eight children taking the drug by the end. Just as surprising, Ms. Bailey said, was learning that the university psychiatrist who supervised Anya’s care received more than $7,000 from 2003 to 2004 from Johnson & Johnson, Risperdal’s maker, in return for lectures about one of the company’s drugs. Doctors, including Anya Bailey’s, maintain that payments from drug companies do not influence what they prescribe for patients. But the intersection of money and medicine, and its effect on the well-being of patients, has become one of the most contentious issues in health care. Nowhere is that more true than in psychiatry, where increasing payments to doctors have coincided with the growing use in children of a relatively new class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics. These best-selling drugs, including Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Abilify and Geodon, are now being prescribed to more than half a million children in the United States to help parents deal with behavior problems despite profound risks and almost no approved uses for minors. A New York Times analysis of records in Minnesota, the only state that requires public reports of all drug company marketing payments to doctors, provides rare documentation of how financial relationships between doctors and drug makers correspond to the growing use of atypicals in children. From 2000 to 2005, drug maker payments to Minnesota psychiatrists rose more than sixfold, to $1.6 million. During those same years, prescriptions of antipsychotics for children in Minnesota’s Medicaid program rose more than ninefold. Those who took the most money from makers of atypicals tended to prescribe the drugs to children the most often, the data suggest. On average, Minnesota psychiatrists who received at least $5,000 from atypical makers from 2000 to 2005 appear to have written three times as many atypical prescriptions for children as psychiatrists who received less or no money. The Times analysis focused on prescriptions written for about one-third of Minnesota’s Medicaid population, almost all of whom are disabled. Some doctors were misidentified by pharmacists, but the information provides a rough guide to prescribing patterns in the state. Drug makers underwrite decision makers at every level of care. They pay doctors who prescribe and recommend drugs, teach about the underlying diseases, perform studies and write guidelines that other doctors often feel bound to follow. But studies present strong evidence that financial interests can affect decisions, often without people knowing it. In Minnesota, psychiatrists collected more money from drug makers from 2000 to 2005 than doctors in any other specialty. Total payments to individual psychiatrists ranged from $51 to more than $689,000, with a median of $1,750. Since the records are incomplete, these figures probably underestimate doctors’ actual incomes. Such payments could encourage psychiatrists to use drugs in ways that endanger patients’ physical health, said Dr. Steven E. Hyman, the provost of and former director of the National Institute of Mental Health. The growing use of atypicals in children is the most troubling example of this, Dr. Hyman said. “There’s an irony that psychiatrists ask patients to have insights into themselves, but we don’t connect the wires in our own lives about how money is affecting our profession and putting our patients at risk,” he said. Anya Bailey is a 15-year-old high school freshman from East Grand Forks, Minn., with pictures of the actor Chad Michael Murray on her bedroom wall. She has constant discomfort in her neck that leads her to twist it in a birdlike fashion. Last year, a boy mimicked her in the lunch room. “The first time, I laughed it off,” Anya said. “I said: ‘That’s so funny. I think I’ll laugh with you.’ Then it got annoying, and I decided to hide it. I don’t want to be made fun of.” Now she slumps when seated at school to pressure her clenched muscles, she said. It all began in 2003 when Anya became dangerously thin. “Nothing tasted good to her,” Ms. Bailey said. This article is by Gardiner Harris, Benedict Carey and Janet Roberts.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/health/11heartweb.html	Electric Pulses, Instead of Shocks, Can Help Heart Patients - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior Electric Pulses, Instead of Shocks, Can Help Heart Patients Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 DENVER, May 10 — Many heart patients who believe that their lives have been saved by shocks from implanted could have survived without a jolt from the devices, according to research presented here today at a meeting of heart specialists. The devices can safely be programmed instead to rely on pacemaking features, which deliver a stream of electric pulses that patients do not feel, in many situations where they currently deliver the shocks, the study concluded. In fact, the data suggested that programming the devices to ignore some irregularities in a patient’s heartbeat and thus to deliver shocks less frequently might actually save lives. The study comes on top of well-known data that 80 percent or more of the patients who receive the defibrillators as protection against a seizure never need a shock. Now, with the new study concluding that even when the devices are thought to be saving lives they might be doing so in an unnecessarily harsh way, doctors are likely to be more worried than ever about their inability to figure out when patients truly need the devices and how best to use them. “A lot of these shocks should be classified as inappropriate,” said Dr. Bruce L. Wilkoff, a defibrillator expert from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who was the lead investigator and who presented the study results. Commenting on the lower death rate in the group of 700 patients whose devices were programmed to give shocks in fewer situations, Dr. Wilkoff said the difference was not statistically significant enough to ensure that the study’s approach was safer. But the trends in the data raised questions about whether unnecessary shocks weaken hearts in ways that raise the risks of death or hospitalization, he said. The new study was sponsored by Medtronic, the leading manufacturer of implanted defibrillators. It reflected the struggle among doctors to figure out the best uses of the expensive defibrillators. Other studies presented at the meeting explored specialized stress tests and minute differences in the behavior of hearts that might pinpoint which patients are most at risk of sudden cardiac arrest if they do not get defibrillators. The devices, which consist of a pocket-watch-size generator implanted in the chest and one to three leads inserted into the heart, cost as much as $50,000 to implant. Major clinical trials have shown that hundreds of thousands of Americans annually suffer from heart conditions — mainly a sharply reduced capacity to pump blood — that put them at risk for the kinds of breakdowns the defibrillators are designed to manage. Doctors believe that thousands of lives have been saved by the devices and that they should be more widely used. But the inability to figure out which patients are most at risk has slowed growth in the market, which was also hit in 2005 by news of malfunctions linked to a handful of deaths. Guidant, the manufacturer of the deadly devices, compounded the negative reaction by failing to disclose the problems promptly. Not all of the research reported here was weighty. The Heart Rhythm Society, the medical group that runs the annual meeting, also highlighted a small study by a Michigan high school student demonstrating that iPods can disrupt some functions of standard pacemakers when they are placed in a shirt pocket. The biggest impact among the 100 patients tested was a case in which the iPod caused the pacemaker to skip a few beats. Jay Thaker, the 17 year-old student who came up with the idea for the study, worked at with Dr. Krit Jongnarangsin, who has since moved to the The study was the first to focus on portable music players but did not surprise anyone at the meeting because of numerous studies in the past showing that other devices like cell phones have similar effects. Patients who get implants are routinely warned about exposure to a wide range of consumer electronics, airport screening machines and other devices that generate electromagnetic fields.

Traces of tetrachloroethylene were found there last week. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 The area in Queens where city officials found an industrial chemical in the drinking water last week has had problems with contamination by the same chemical for several years. The chemical — tetrachloroethylene, which is commonly used by dry cleaners and auto repair shops — has been detected sporadically in the water in Cambria Heights, Hollis and St. Albans every year since at least 2003, according to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection’s annual reports of drinking water quality. Anne Canty, the department’s deputy commissioner, said that testing yesterday detected continuing contamination, though at somewhat lower concentrations. Ten of 26 recent samples still contained traces of the colorless chemical, which has a sharp, sweet odor and is also known as perc. According to the federal , people who drink water containing tetrachloroethylene over many years can develop liver problems and may have an increased risk of . In New York City, the chemical is also considered an airborne hazard because many dry cleaners are inside residential buildings where fumes can seep through ceilings and walls. The city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene does not consider the amount of tetrachloroethylene in the water a serious health problem. People who remain concerned have been told to use bottled water for cooking and drinking and to take shorter showers. The contamination was detected last week during routine water testing. The city is required to notify water users if the average level of the chemical detected in water exceeds 5 parts per billion. As testing continued this week, some readings were as high as 13 parts per billion, more than double the maximum safe level. But as of late yesterday, the average level of the chemical had dropped to 3.7 parts per billion. Most of New York City gets drinking water from reservoirs 100 or more miles away and has not had a problem with the dry cleaning chemicals. But a five-and-a-half-mile section of southeastern Queens, which includes the area where the contamination was found, is sometimes served by a system of wells that are 100 to 360 feet deep. The wells belonged to a private water company until they were taken over by the city in 1996. Many have become contaminated with a variety of pollutants, including tetrachloroethylene, and can no longer be used. In 2005, five wells were in use, providing the neighborhood’s 100,000 residents with 2.2 million gallons of water a day, about 1 percent of the total used citywide every day. The wells had to be shut in February after pumps failed. The city plans to build a treatment plant for the wells, but construction is not scheduled to begin before 2009. Officials said that despite the recurring problem, they believed that the contaminated water found this week did not come from wells. An analysis of the chemical content of water indicated that it came from the main water system, officials said. Ms. Canty said water quality experts suspected that the current problem began with a faulty valve that failed to keep a small amount of chemical discharge from backing up into the drinking water system. Inspectors had checked about 300 dry cleaners and auto repair shops by midday yesterday, but the source of contamination was not discovered. In the meantime, Ms. Canty said, hydrants in the area were being flushed and the city expected the problem to be cleared up in a few days. In 2003, at least one sample of the well water in Queens exceeded 17 parts per billion. In both 2004 and 2005, tetrachloroethylene was detected in several samples and sometimes exceeded the safe level. But advisories were not issued in either year because the average of at least two consecutive readings fell below 5 parts per billion.

The bill would increase the fees paid by drug makers to help finance the work of the Food and Drug Administration and would give the agency new power to police company conduct. Industry lobbyists and executives said they supported the bill for one overriding reason: pink slips. Sometime this summer, if a bill has not passed, medical officers at the F.D.A. will start getting notices that they are in danger of being laid off by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Some of those officers are likely to be in the midst of reviewing new drug applications crucial to the future of drug makers. If those medical officers leave, drug approvals may be delayed &#151; a terrifying prospect for many companies. &#8220;The last thing we want is for F.D.A. employees to start thinking they may not have a job and start leaving,&#8221; said Alan R. Goldhammer, deputy vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for brand-name drug companies. In addition, many in the drug industry said they supported the bill because they believed that it would help restore public confidence in the nation&#8217;s drug supply. &#8220;There has been a loss of confidence in the F.D.A., and we can&#8217;t afford to have that,&#8221; said Dr. Joseph M. Feczko, Pfizer&#8217;s chief medical officer. &#8220;When our medicines come out, we want people to understand they have gone through a rigorous review process.&#8221; Under the bill, the F.D.A. could impose civil fines on companies that violated a drug safety plan or ran false or misleading advertisements. But major drug makers said they would comply with federal requirements, so the agency would not have reason to impose penalties on them. , Democrat of Massachusetts, was chief sponsor of the legislation, but Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, was equally responsible for its contents. In an unusual display of bipartisanship, they worked together to fend off amendments that would have made the bill unacceptable to the White House, raised the ire of the pharmaceutical industry or jeopardized chances for passage. &#8220;Kennedy and I have developed a trust,&#8221; Mr. Enzi said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t try to run over each other. We have a history of passing bills &#151; 27 signed by the president in the last two years.&#8221; An earlier version of the legislation was introduced by Mr. Enzi last August, when controlled Congress and he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. When Democrats took control this year and Mr. Kennedy became chairman of the committee, he kept his compact with Mr. Enzi. Working together, they steered the legislation through the committee and the full Senate. Along the way, they accepted dozens of changes proposed by lawmakers of both parties. Mr. Enzi, an accountant and former owner of a shoe store, was mayor of Gillette, Wyo., and served 10 years in the State Legislature. His quiet manner could hardly differ more from that of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Enzi is as conservative as Mr. Kennedy is liberal. But both are pragmatic legislative craftsmen. Mr. Enzi was recruited into politics by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, another Wyoming Republican who collaborated with Mr. Kennedy on many issues, including In an interview, Mr. Simpson said: &#8220;Mike is a legislator. He&#8217;s calm. He&#8217;s steady. He&#8217;s not a partisan kook or anything of that nature.&#8221; Mr. Simpson said Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy had &#8220;a mutual admiration society, built on trust, respect and friendship, with none of the savage partisanship&#8221; found elsewhere in American politics. Mr. Enzi holds the Senate seat once held by Mr. Simpson and his father, Milward L. Simpson, who entered the Senate on the same day as Mr. Kennedy, Nov. 7, 1962. &#8220;Teddy loved my dad,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, who nurtured the relationship between Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy. , Republican of New Hampshire, voted against the drug safety bill in the committee, but worked with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi to make changes that won his support for the legislation on the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a Ted Kennedy who is quite flamboyant and partisan in the theater of the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Gregg said in an interview. &#8220;And there is a Ted Kennedy who is extremely bipartisan and willing to work with people in the back rooms of the Senate.&#8221; Industry officials breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, that would effectively maintain the current ban on imported drugs. Drug makers fiercely oppose efforts to legalize imports of lower-cost medicines from Canada and other countries. Having won that fight, drug company executives said, they decided not to fight other provisions that they saw as less threatening. &#8220;They need to pick their battles,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. &#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t interfere with pricing and approvals is not going to hurt them seriously.&#8221; Still, many advocates, including some who support the bill&#8217;s passage, said the legislation was not the answer to the nation&#8217;s drug safety problems. &#8220;We have horrible leadership at the F.D.A., and they don&#8217;t even use the authorities they already have,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This By GARDINER HARRIS, BENEDICT CAREY and JANET ROBERTS Published: May 10, 2007 When Anya Bailey developed an after her 12th birthday, her mother took her to a psychiatrist at the who prescribed a powerful antipsychotic drug called Risperdal. Skip to next paragraph The New York Times , Risperdal is not approved to treat eating disorders, but increased appetite is a common side effect and doctors may prescribe drugs as they see fit. Anya gained weight but within two years developed a crippling knot in her back. She now receives regular injections of Botox to unclench her back muscles. She often awakens crying in pain. Isabella Bailey, Anya’s mother, said she had no idea that children might be especially susceptible to Risperdal’s side effects. Nor did she know that Risperdal and similar medicines were not approved at the time to treat children, or that medical trials often cited to justify the use of such drugs had as few as eight children taking the drug by the end. Just as surprising, Ms. Bailey said, was learning that the university psychiatrist who supervised Anya’s care received more than $7,000 from 2003 to 2004 from Johnson & Johnson, Risperdal’s maker, in return for lectures about one of the company’s drugs. Doctors, including Anya Bailey’s, maintain that payments from drug companies do not influence what they prescribe for patients. But the intersection of money and medicine, and its effect on the well-being of patients, has become one of the most contentious issues in health care. Nowhere is that more true than in psychiatry, where increasing payments to doctors have coincided with the growing use in children of a relatively new class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics. These best-selling drugs, including Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Abilify and Geodon, are now being prescribed to more than half a million children in the United States to help parents deal with behavior problems despite profound risks and almost no approved uses for minors. A New York Times analysis of records in Minnesota, the only state that requires public reports of all drug company marketing payments to doctors, provides rare documentation of how financial relationships between doctors and drug makers correspond to the growing use of atypicals in children. From 2000 to 2005, drug maker payments to Minnesota psychiatrists rose more than sixfold, to $1.6 million. During those same years, prescriptions of antipsychotics for children in Minnesota’s Medicaid program rose more than ninefold. Those who took the most money from makers of atypicals tended to prescribe the drugs to children the most often, the data suggest. On average, Minnesota psychiatrists who received at least $5,000 from atypical makers from 2000 to 2005 appear to have written three times as many atypical prescriptions for children as psychiatrists who received less or no money. The Times analysis focused on prescriptions written for about one-third of Minnesota’s Medicaid population, almost all of whom are disabled. Some doctors were misidentified by pharmacists, but the information provides a rough guide to prescribing patterns in the state. Drug makers underwrite decision makers at every level of care. They pay doctors who prescribe and recommend drugs, teach about the underlying diseases, perform studies and write guidelines that other doctors often feel bound to follow. But studies present strong evidence that financial interests can affect decisions, often without people knowing it. In Minnesota, psychiatrists collected more money from drug makers from 2000 to 2005 than doctors in any other specialty. Total payments to individual psychiatrists ranged from $51 to more than $689,000, with a median of $1,750. Since the records are incomplete, these figures probably underestimate doctors’ actual incomes. Such payments could encourage psychiatrists to use drugs in ways that endanger patients’ physical health, said Dr. Steven E. Hyman, the provost of and former director of the National Institute of Mental Health. The growing use of atypicals in children is the most troubling example of this, Dr. Hyman said. “There’s an irony that psychiatrists ask patients to have insights into themselves, but we don’t connect the wires in our own lives about how money is affecting our profession and putting our patients at risk,” he said. Anya Bailey is a 15-year-old high school freshman from East Grand Forks, Minn., with pictures of the actor Chad Michael Murray on her bedroom wall. She has constant discomfort in her neck that leads her to twist it in a birdlike fashion. Last year, a boy mimicked her in the lunch room. “The first time, I laughed it off,” Anya said. “I said: ‘That’s so funny. I think I’ll laugh with you.’ Then it got annoying, and I decided to hide it. I don’t want to be made fun of.” Now she slumps when seated at school to pressure her clenched muscles, she said. It all began in 2003 when Anya became dangerously thin. “Nothing tasted good to her,” Ms. Bailey said. This article is by Gardiner Harris, Benedict Carey and Janet Roberts.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/health/11heartweb.html?ex=1336536000&en=a6d34bf9f04bd9e0&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss	Electric Pulses, Instead of Shocks, Can Help Heart Patients - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior Electric Pulses, Instead of Shocks, Can Help Heart Patients Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 DENVER, May 10 — Many heart patients who believe that their lives have been saved by shocks from implanted could have survived without a jolt from the devices, according to research presented here today at a meeting of heart specialists. The devices can safely be programmed instead to rely on pacemaking features, which deliver a stream of electric pulses that patients do not feel, in many situations where they currently deliver the shocks, the study concluded. In fact, the data suggested that programming the devices to ignore some irregularities in a patient’s heartbeat and thus to deliver shocks less frequently might actually save lives. The study comes on top of well-known data that 80 percent or more of the patients who receive the defibrillators as protection against a seizure never need a shock. Now, with the new study concluding that even when the devices are thought to be saving lives they might be doing so in an unnecessarily harsh way, doctors are likely to be more worried than ever about their inability to figure out when patients truly need the devices and how best to use them. “A lot of these shocks should be classified as inappropriate,” said Dr. Bruce L. Wilkoff, a defibrillator expert from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who was the lead investigator and who presented the study results. Commenting on the lower death rate in the group of 700 patients whose devices were programmed to give shocks in fewer situations, Dr. Wilkoff said the difference was not statistically significant enough to ensure that the study’s approach was safer. But the trends in the data raised questions about whether unnecessary shocks weaken hearts in ways that raise the risks of death or hospitalization, he said. The new study was sponsored by Medtronic, the leading manufacturer of implanted defibrillators. It reflected the struggle among doctors to figure out the best uses of the expensive defibrillators. Other studies presented at the meeting explored specialized stress tests and minute differences in the behavior of hearts that might pinpoint which patients are most at risk of sudden cardiac arrest if they do not get defibrillators. The devices, which consist of a pocket-watch-size generator implanted in the chest and one to three leads inserted into the heart, cost as much as $50,000 to implant. Major clinical trials have shown that hundreds of thousands of Americans annually suffer from heart conditions — mainly a sharply reduced capacity to pump blood — that put them at risk for the kinds of breakdowns the defibrillators are designed to manage. Doctors believe that thousands of lives have been saved by the devices and that they should be more widely used. But the inability to figure out which patients are most at risk has slowed growth in the market, which was also hit in 2005 by news of malfunctions linked to a handful of deaths. Guidant, the manufacturer of the deadly devices, compounded the negative reaction by failing to disclose the problems promptly. Not all of the research reported here was weighty. The Heart Rhythm Society, the medical group that runs the annual meeting, also highlighted a small study by a Michigan high school student demonstrating that iPods can disrupt some functions of standard pacemakers when they are placed in a shirt pocket. The biggest impact among the 100 patients tested was a case in which the iPod caused the pacemaker to skip a few beats. Jay Thaker, the 17 year-old student who came up with the idea for the study, worked at with Dr. Krit Jongnarangsin, who has since moved to the The study was the first to focus on portable music players but did not surprise anyone at the meeting because of numerous studies in the past showing that other devices like cell phones have similar effects. Patients who get implants are routinely warned about exposure to a wide range of consumer electronics, airport screening machines and other devices that generate electromagnetic fields.

Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior F.D.A. Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 SILVER SPRING, Md., May 10 &#151; Bowing to safety concerns, government medical advisers urged on Thursday that additional restrictions be put on the use of drugs that treat The recommendations by an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration followed a flurry of studies suggesting that the drugs, meant to help patients cope with , might actually be making their cancer worse or hastening their deaths. The drugs &#151; Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &#38; Johnson &#151; are used by about a half-million American cancer patients a year and have billions of dollars in annual sales. Some members of the committee expressed shock that even though Procrit was first approved 14 years ago, it was still not clear if the drugs were safe at the doses typically used. &#8220;Yes, we have a burning question,&#8221; one panel member, Dr. Silvana Martino, an oncologist in Santa Monica, Calif., said at the meeting here. &#8220;Do these things kill people?&#8221; Most of the studies showing a risk involved use of the drugs at doses higher than doctors typically give them. That left the committee with the question of what to do about use of the drugs at the usual doses until more data become available. The F.D.A. has already clamped down on the drugs. In March it put strict new warnings on the labels, saying the products should be used at the smallest dosage that lets anemic patients avoid blood transfusions. But the panel&#8217;s votes Thursday portend even further restrictions. The committee voted 12 to 5, for instance, that the drugs should be barred from use by patients with certain types of cancer until more is known about their safety. While the committee did not specify which types, several members mentioned , non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. The committee voted 15 to 2 that there should be more restrictions in general if the drugs remain on the market, and 17 to 0 that more studies were needed. And it voted 16 to 1 that anemia therapy should be stopped when chemotherapy is finished. But in one victory for the drug makers, the committee voted 11 to 6 against lowering the ceiling on how much the anemia should be corrected. The labels now say that a patient&#8217;s hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells, should not be raised to more than 12 grams per deciliter of blood. The F.D.A. usually follows the recommendations of such panels. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the agency&#8217;s cancer drug division, said Thursday he could not say yet when or how the agency would act. The two drugs, along with another Amgen drug, Epogen, are also used to treat anemia caused by kidney disease, but yesterday&#8217;s meeting concerned only cancer treatment. Another hearing dealing with kidney disease will be held early in the fall. The panel&#8217;s recommendations were a particular blow to Amgen, which last year took in nearly half its $14.3 billion in revenue from the anemia drugs. Johnson &#38; Johnson is far larger and more diversified than Amgen, and so is less dependent on Procrit sales. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s worse than what investors expected,&#8221; Michael Aberman, an analyst who follows Amgen for Credit Suisse, said after the meeting. Amgen&#8217;s stock fell $5.77, or more than 9 percent, to close at $57.33. Trish Hawkins, an Amgen spokeswoman, said in a statement, &#8220;We will be working with the F.D.A. as they consider the committee&#8217;s recommendations.&#8221; The drugs, known generically as darbepoetin and epoetin, were approved to reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with anemia from chemotherapy. Many doctors and patients believe the drugs fight fatigue and improve patients&#8217; daily lives, although the F.D.A. said it did not find studies with persuasive evidence of such benefits. A panel member from , Dr. Otis Brawley, said some doctors overprescribed the drugs because they made money from doing so. Doctors can sometimes receive more from insurers than they pay for the drugs, especially if they receive rebates from the manufacturers. Dr. Brawley said the drug companies had not done proper studies, and at one point asked them, &#8220;What data do you have to assure me that this is not Miracle-Gro for cancer?&#8221; The staff of the F.D.A. was also critical of the companies, saying they had not provided data they had promised when a similar advisory panel meeting was held in 2004. The companies and their advocates argued that ample data showed the drugs were safe when used properly, except for a long-known risk of increased blood clots. They also argued that the drugs had significant benefits. Forcing cancer patients to go back to transfusions, they said, would expose the patients to risks and inconvenience and further strain the nation&#8217;s already taxed blood supply. That sentiment was also voiced by some committee members. &#8220;I think the idea of going back to the dark ages in regards to supportive care is a step backward,&#8221; said Dr. S. Gail Eckhardt of the , the panel&#8217;s chairman. Advisory panel meetings often feature eloquent pleas from patients that a drug be approved or kept on the market. But there was not a big outpouring of support for the anemia drugs. In fact, some patients expressed dismay at how the drugs were used. &#8220;How is it possible that what was meant to help me might actually have made things worse?&#8221; said Lilla Romeo, who has had breast cancer since 1995.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/us/11milk.html	Dairy Council to End Ad Campaign That Linked Drinking Milk With Weight Loss - New York Times Dairy Council to End Ad Campaign That Linked Drinking Milk With Weight Loss Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 A national advertising campaign that associates dairy products with weight loss will be curtailed because research does not support the claim, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The advertisements, conceived by the promotional arm of the dairy industry and overseen by the Agriculture Department, feature slogans like &#8220;Milk your . Lose weight!&#8221; and suggest that three servings of dairy products a day can help people be slim. The effort includes a campaign called &#8220;Body by Milk&#8221; that is aimed at teenagers. It features Alex Rodriguez, the third baseman for the New York Yankees, and Carrie Underwood, an &#8220;American Idol&#8221; winner. The assertion that there is a link between weight loss and dairy consumption has long been contested by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy and research group that promotes a diet free of animal products. The group petitioned the F.T.C. in 2005 to argue that the advertisements were misleading. In a May 3 letter to the group, Lydia Parnes, director of the agency&#8217;s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Agriculture Department representatives and milk producers and processors had agreed to change the advertisements and related marketing materials &#8220;until further research provides stronger, more conclusive evidence of an association between dairy consumption and weight loss.&#8221; As of Thursday, the National Dairy Council still had a section of its Web site devoted to the weight-loss claim. But the site, along with some of the advertisements, will be changed, said Greg Miller, who is executive vice president of the council and has a doctorate in nutrition. &#8220;Like any other marketing campaign, after time you want to freshen them up and give the consumers what&#8217;s new,&#8221; Mr. Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.&#8221; Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the group that brought the matter to the F.T.C., said it would continue to press the dairy industry on other claims, which include the assertion that calcium helps prevent bone fractures in older women. &#8220;I think people will start to recognize that the dairy industry, which used to have a mom-and-pop image, is a huge commercial entity that will exaggerate to sell its products,&#8221; Dr. Barnard said. Mr. Miller said most medical professionals agreed that dairy contributed to overall bone health and could help people maintain a healthy weight. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a minority of people out there that just have very loud voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a vegan group that doesn&#8217;t want anyone to eat dairy.&#8221; Dairy products were upgraded in the 2005 revision of federal dietary guidelines, which recommended that people consume more low-fat milk and dairy products. An advisory committee that helped set the guidelines cited a report, partly financed by the dairy industry, which found that low-fat dairy products did not necessarily add to weight gain and that dairy products have certain nutrients that can help consumers meet dietary recommendations. The guidelines increased the amount of low-fat or fat-free dairy products to three cups a day, up from two cups. The dairy council is allowed to continue to use wording from those guidelines that says adults and children should not avoid milk and milk products because of concerns that they may lead to weight gain, the letter from the F.T.C. said. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at , said the agreement to modify the advertisements was groundbreaking.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/health/11anemia.html	F.D.A. Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior F.D.A. Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 SILVER SPRING, Md., May 10 &#151; Bowing to safety concerns, government medical advisers urged on Thursday that additional restrictions be put on the use of drugs that treat The recommendations by an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration followed a flurry of studies suggesting that the drugs, meant to help patients cope with , might actually be making their cancer worse or hastening their deaths. The drugs &#151; Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &#38; Johnson &#151; are used by about a half-million American cancer patients a year and have billions of dollars in annual sales. Some members of the committee expressed shock that even though Procrit was first approved 14 years ago, it was still not clear if the drugs were safe at the doses typically used. &#8220;Yes, we have a burning question,&#8221; one panel member, Dr. Silvana Martino, an oncologist in Santa Monica, Calif., said at the meeting here. &#8220;Do these things kill people?&#8221; Most of the studies showing a risk involved use of the drugs at doses higher than doctors typically give them. That left the committee with the question of what to do about use of the drugs at the usual doses until more data become available. The F.D.A. has already clamped down on the drugs. In March it put strict new warnings on the labels, saying the products should be used at the smallest dosage that lets anemic patients avoid blood transfusions. But the panel&#8217;s votes Thursday portend even further restrictions. The committee voted 12 to 5, for instance, that the drugs should be barred from use by patients with certain types of cancer until more is known about their safety. While the committee did not specify which types, several members mentioned , non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. The committee voted 15 to 2 that there should be more restrictions in general if the drugs remain on the market, and 17 to 0 that more studies were needed. And it voted 16 to 1 that anemia therapy should be stopped when chemotherapy is finished. But in one victory for the drug makers, the committee voted 11 to 6 against lowering the ceiling on how much the anemia should be corrected. The labels now say that a patient&#8217;s hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells, should not be raised to more than 12 grams per deciliter of blood. The F.D.A. usually follows the recommendations of such panels. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the agency&#8217;s cancer drug division, said Thursday he could not say yet when or how the agency would act. The two drugs, along with another Amgen drug, Epogen, are also used to treat anemia caused by kidney disease, but yesterday&#8217;s meeting concerned only cancer treatment. Another hearing dealing with kidney disease will be held early in the fall. The panel&#8217;s recommendations were a particular blow to Amgen, which last year took in nearly half its $14.3 billion in revenue from the anemia drugs. Johnson &#38; Johnson is far larger and more diversified than Amgen, and so is less dependent on Procrit sales. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s worse than what investors expected,&#8221; Michael Aberman, an analyst who follows Amgen for Credit Suisse, said after the meeting. Amgen&#8217;s stock fell $5.77, or more than 9 percent, to close at $57.33. Trish Hawkins, an Amgen spokeswoman, said in a statement, &#8220;We will be working with the F.D.A. as they consider the committee&#8217;s recommendations.&#8221; The drugs, known generically as darbepoetin and epoetin, were approved to reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with anemia from chemotherapy. Many doctors and patients believe the drugs fight fatigue and improve patients&#8217; daily lives, although the F.D.A. said it did not find studies with persuasive evidence of such benefits. A panel member from , Dr. Otis Brawley, said some doctors overprescribed the drugs because they made money from doing so. Doctors can sometimes receive more from insurers than they pay for the drugs, especially if they receive rebates from the manufacturers. Dr. Brawley said the drug companies had not done proper studies, and at one point asked them, &#8220;What data do you have to assure me that this is not Miracle-Gro for cancer?&#8221; The staff of the F.D.A. was also critical of the companies, saying they had not provided data they had promised when a similar advisory panel meeting was held in 2004. The companies and their advocates argued that ample data showed the drugs were safe when used properly, except for a long-known risk of increased blood clots. They also argued that the drugs had significant benefits. Forcing cancer patients to go back to transfusions, they said, would expose the patients to risks and inconvenience and further strain the nation&#8217;s already taxed blood supply. That sentiment was also voiced by some committee members. &#8220;I think the idea of going back to the dark ages in regards to supportive care is a step backward,&#8221; said Dr. S. Gail Eckhardt of the , the panel&#8217;s chairman. Advisory panel meetings often feature eloquent pleas from patients that a drug be approved or kept on the market. But there was not a big outpouring of support for the anemia drugs. In fact, some patients expressed dismay at how the drugs were used. &#8220;How is it possible that what was meant to help me might actually have made things worse?&#8221; said Lilla Romeo, who has had breast cancer since 1995.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/washington/11fda.html	Passage of Drug Safety Bill Was Common Goal for Two Very Different Senators - New York Times Passage of Drug Safety Bill Was Common Goal for Two Very Different Senators Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 &#151; Legislation to beef up drug safety, passed by the Senate this week with only one dissenting vote, grew out of an extraordinary pact between two senators and a frantic effort by the pharmaceutical industry to avoid any disruption in the approval of new drugs. The bill would increase the fees paid by drug makers to help finance the work of the Food and Drug Administration and would give the agency new power to police company conduct. Industry lobbyists and executives said they supported the bill for one overriding reason: pink slips. Sometime this summer, if a bill has not passed, medical officers at the F.D.A. will start getting notices that they are in danger of being laid off by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Some of those officers are likely to be in the midst of reviewing new drug applications crucial to the future of drug makers. If those medical officers leave, drug approvals may be delayed &#151; a terrifying prospect for many companies. &#8220;The last thing we want is for F.D.A. employees to start thinking they may not have a job and start leaving,&#8221; said Alan R. Goldhammer, deputy vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for brand-name drug companies. In addition, many in the drug industry said they supported the bill because they believed that it would help restore public confidence in the nation&#8217;s drug supply. &#8220;There has been a loss of confidence in the F.D.A., and we can&#8217;t afford to have that,&#8221; said Dr. Joseph M. Feczko, Pfizer&#8217;s chief medical officer. &#8220;When our medicines come out, we want people to understand they have gone through a rigorous review process.&#8221; Under the bill, the F.D.A. could impose civil fines on companies that violated a drug safety plan or ran false or misleading advertisements. But major drug makers said they would comply with federal requirements, so the agency would not have reason to impose penalties on them. , Democrat of Massachusetts, was chief sponsor of the legislation, but Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, was equally responsible for its contents. In an unusual display of bipartisanship, they worked together to fend off amendments that would have made the bill unacceptable to the White House, raised the ire of the pharmaceutical industry or jeopardized chances for passage. &#8220;Kennedy and I have developed a trust,&#8221; Mr. Enzi said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t try to run over each other. We have a history of passing bills &#151; 27 signed by the president in the last two years.&#8221; An earlier version of the legislation was introduced by Mr. Enzi last August, when controlled Congress and he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. When Democrats took control this year and Mr. Kennedy became chairman of the committee, he kept his compact with Mr. Enzi. Working together, they steered the legislation through the committee and the full Senate. Along the way, they accepted dozens of changes proposed by lawmakers of both parties. Mr. Enzi, an accountant and former owner of a shoe store, was mayor of Gillette, Wyo., and served 10 years in the State Legislature. His quiet manner could hardly differ more from that of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Enzi is as conservative as Mr. Kennedy is liberal. But both are pragmatic legislative craftsmen. Mr. Enzi was recruited into politics by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, another Wyoming Republican who collaborated with Mr. Kennedy on many issues, including In an interview, Mr. Simpson said: &#8220;Mike is a legislator. He&#8217;s calm. He&#8217;s steady. He&#8217;s not a partisan kook or anything of that nature.&#8221; Mr. Simpson said Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy had &#8220;a mutual admiration society, built on trust, respect and friendship, with none of the savage partisanship&#8221; found elsewhere in American politics. Mr. Enzi holds the Senate seat once held by Mr. Simpson and his father, Milward L. Simpson, who entered the Senate on the same day as Mr. Kennedy, Nov. 7, 1962. &#8220;Teddy loved my dad,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, who nurtured the relationship between Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy. , Republican of New Hampshire, voted against the drug safety bill in the committee, but worked with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi to make changes that won his support for the legislation on the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a Ted Kennedy who is quite flamboyant and partisan in the theater of the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Gregg said in an interview. &#8220;And there is a Ted Kennedy who is extremely bipartisan and willing to work with people in the back rooms of the Senate.&#8221; Industry officials breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, that would effectively maintain the current ban on imported drugs. Drug makers fiercely oppose efforts to legalize imports of lower-cost medicines from Canada and other countries. Having won that fight, drug company executives said, they decided not to fight other provisions that they saw as less threatening. &#8220;They need to pick their battles,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. &#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t interfere with pricing and approvals is not going to hurt them seriously.&#8221; Still, many advocates, including some who support the bill&#8217;s passage, said the legislation was not the answer to the nation&#8217;s drug safety problems. &#8220;We have horrible leadership at the F.D.A., and they don&#8217;t even use the authorities they already have,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/us/11milk.html?ex=1336536000&en=579284b9d162b729&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss	Dairy Council to End Ad Campaign That Linked Drinking Milk With Weight Loss - New York Times Dairy Council to End Ad Campaign That Linked Drinking Milk With Weight Loss Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 A national advertising campaign that associates dairy products with weight loss will be curtailed because research does not support the claim, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The advertisements, conceived by the promotional arm of the dairy industry and overseen by the Agriculture Department, feature slogans like &#8220;Milk your . Lose weight!&#8221; and suggest that three servings of dairy products a day can help people be slim. The effort includes a campaign called &#8220;Body by Milk&#8221; that is aimed at teenagers. It features Alex Rodriguez, the third baseman for the New York Yankees, and Carrie Underwood, an &#8220;American Idol&#8221; winner. The assertion that there is a link between weight loss and dairy consumption has long been contested by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy and research group that promotes a diet free of animal products. The group petitioned the F.T.C. in 2005 to argue that the advertisements were misleading. In a May 3 letter to the group, Lydia Parnes, director of the agency&#8217;s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Agriculture Department representatives and milk producers and processors had agreed to change the advertisements and related marketing materials &#8220;until further research provides stronger, more conclusive evidence of an association between dairy consumption and weight loss.&#8221; As of Thursday, the National Dairy Council still had a section of its Web site devoted to the weight-loss claim. But the site, along with some of the advertisements, will be changed, said Greg Miller, who is executive vice president of the council and has a doctorate in nutrition. &#8220;Like any other marketing campaign, after time you want to freshen them up and give the consumers what&#8217;s new,&#8221; Mr. Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.&#8221; Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the group that brought the matter to the F.T.C., said it would continue to press the dairy industry on other claims, which include the assertion that calcium helps prevent bone fractures in older women. &#8220;I think people will start to recognize that the dairy industry, which used to have a mom-and-pop image, is a huge commercial entity that will exaggerate to sell its products,&#8221; Dr. Barnard said. Mr. Miller said most medical professionals agreed that dairy contributed to overall bone health and could help people maintain a healthy weight. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a minority of people out there that just have very loud voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a vegan group that doesn&#8217;t want anyone to eat dairy.&#8221; Dairy products were upgraded in the 2005 revision of federal dietary guidelines, which recommended that people consume more low-fat milk and dairy products. An advisory committee that helped set the guidelines cited a report, partly financed by the dairy industry, which found that low-fat dairy products did not necessarily add to weight gain and that dairy products have certain nutrients that can help consumers meet dietary recommendations. The guidelines increased the amount of low-fat or fat-free dairy products to three cups a day, up from two cups. The dairy council is allowed to continue to use wording from those guidelines that says adults and children should not avoid milk and milk products because of concerns that they may lead to weight gain, the letter from the F.T.C. said. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at , said the agreement to modify the advertisements was groundbreaking. In her book, &#8220;What to Eat,&#8221; she argued that lobbying by the $50 billion dairy industry could sometimes cloud policy on nutrition. Though Ms. Nestle said she ate dairy products regularly and did not dispute their nutritional value, she said people could have a healthy diet without them. &#8220;Those ads were ridiculously misleading,&#8221; she said.

Anya gained weight but within two years developed a crippling knot in her back. She now receives regular injections of Botox to unclench her back muscles. She often awakens crying in pain. Isabella Bailey, Anya’s mother, said she had no idea that children might be especially susceptible to Risperdal’s side effects. Nor did she know that Risperdal and similar medicines were not approved at the time to treat children, or that medical trials often cited to justify the use of such drugs had as few as eight children taking the drug by the end. Just as surprising, Ms. Bailey said, was learning that the university psychiatrist who supervised Anya’s care received more than $7,000 from 2003 to 2004 from Johnson & Johnson, Risperdal’s maker, in return for lectures about one of the company’s drugs. Doctors, including Anya Bailey’s, maintain that payments from drug companies do not influence what they prescribe for patients. But the intersection of money and medicine, and its effect on the well-being of patients, has become one of the most contentious issues in health care. Nowhere is that more true than in psychiatry, where increasing payments to doctors have coincided with the growing use in children of a relatively new class of drugs known as atypical antipsychotics. These best-selling drugs, including Risperdal, Seroquel, Zyprexa, Abilify and Geodon, are now being prescribed to more than half a million children in the United States to help parents deal with behavior problems despite profound risks and almost no approved uses for minors. A New York Times analysis of records in Minnesota, the only state that requires public reports of all drug company marketing payments to doctors, provides rare documentation of how financial relationships between doctors and drug makers correspond to the growing use of atypicals in children. From 2000 to 2005, drug maker payments to Minnesota psychiatrists rose more than sixfold, to $1.6 million. During those same years, prescriptions of antipsychotics for children in Minnesota’s Medicaid program rose more than ninefold. Those who took the most money from makers of atypicals tended to prescribe the drugs to children the most often, the data suggest. On average, Minnesota psychiatrists who received at least $5,000 from atypical makers from 2000 to 2005 appear to have written three times as many atypical prescriptions for children as psychiatrists who received less or no money. The Times analysis focused on prescriptions written for about one-third of Minnesota’s Medicaid population, almost all of whom are disabled. Some doctors were misidentified by pharmacists, but the information provides a rough guide to prescribing patterns in the state. Drug makers underwrite decision makers at every level of care. They pay doctors who prescribe and recommend drugs, teach about the underlying diseases, perform studies and write guidelines that other doctors often feel bound to follow. But studies present strong evidence that financial interests can affect decisions, often without people knowing it. In Minnesota, psychiatrists collected more money from drug makers from 2000 to 2005 than doctors in any other specialty. Total payments to individual psychiatrists ranged from $51 to more than $689,000, with a median of $1,750. Since the records are incomplete, these figures probably underestimate doctors’ actual incomes. Such payments could encourage psychiatrists to use drugs in ways that endanger patients’ physical health, said Dr. Steven E. Hyman, the provost of and former director of the National Institute of Mental Health. The growing use of atypicals in children is the most troubling example of this, Dr. Hyman said. “There’s an irony that psychiatrists ask patients to have insights into themselves, but we don’t connect the wires in our own lives about how money is affecting our profession and putting our patients at risk,” he said. Anya Bailey is a 15-year-old high school freshman from East Grand Forks, Minn., with pictures of the actor Chad Michael Murray on her bedroom wall. She has constant discomfort in her neck that leads her to twist it in a birdlike fashion. Last year, a boy mimicked her in the lunch room. “The first time, I laughed it off,” Anya said. “I said: ‘That’s so funny. I think I’ll laugh with you.’ Then it got annoying, and I decided to hide it. I don’t want to be made fun of.” Now she slumps when seated at school to pressure her clenched muscles, she said. It all began in 2003 when Anya became dangerously thin. “Nothing tasted good to her,” Ms. Bailey said. This article is by Gardiner Harris, Benedict Carey and Janet Roberts.

The devices can safely be programmed instead to rely on pacemaking features, which deliver a stream of electric pulses that patients do not feel, in many situations where they currently deliver the shocks, the study concluded. In fact, the data suggested that programming the devices to ignore some irregularities in a patient’s heartbeat and thus to deliver shocks less frequently might actually save lives. The study comes on top of well-known data that 80 percent or more of the patients who receive the defibrillators as protection against a seizure never need a shock. Now, with the new study concluding that even when the devices are thought to be saving lives they might be doing so in an unnecessarily harsh way, doctors are likely to be more worried than ever about their inability to figure out when patients truly need the devices and how best to use them. “A lot of these shocks should be classified as inappropriate,” said Dr. Bruce L. Wilkoff, a defibrillator expert from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who was the lead investigator and who presented the study results. Commenting on the lower death rate in the group of 700 patients whose devices were programmed to give shocks in fewer situations, Dr. Wilkoff said the difference was not statistically significant enough to ensure that the study’s approach was safer. But the trends in the data raised questions about whether unnecessary shocks weaken hearts in ways that raise the risks of death or hospitalization, he said. The new study was sponsored by Medtronic, the leading manufacturer of implanted defibrillators. It reflected the struggle among doctors to figure out the best uses of the expensive defibrillators. Other studies presented at the meeting explored specialized stress tests and minute differences in the behavior of hearts that might pinpoint which patients are most at risk of sudden cardiac arrest if they do not get defibrillators. The devices, which consist of a pocket-watch-size generator implanted in the chest and one to three leads inserted into the heart, cost as much as $50,000 to implant. Major clinical trials have shown that hundreds of thousands of Americans annually suffer from heart conditions — mainly a sharply reduced capacity to pump blood — that put them at risk for the kinds of breakdowns the defibrillators are designed to manage. Doctors believe that thousands of lives have been saved by the devices and that they should be more widely used. But the inability to figure out which patients are most at risk has slowed growth in the market, which was also hit in 2005 by news of malfunctions linked to a handful of deaths. Guidant, the manufacturer of the deadly devices, compounded the negative reaction by failing to disclose the problems promptly. Not all of the research reported here was weighty. The Heart Rhythm Society, the medical group that runs the annual meeting, also highlighted a small study by a Michigan high school student demonstrating that iPods can disrupt some functions of standard pacemakers when they are placed in a shirt pocket. The biggest impact among the 100 patients tested was a case in which the iPod caused the pacemaker to skip a few beats. Jay Thaker, the 17 year-old student who came up with the idea for the study, worked at with Dr. Krit Jongnarangsin, who has since moved to the The study was the first to focus on portable music players but did not surprise anyone at the meeting because of numerous studies in the past showing that other devices like cell phones have similar effects. Patients who get implants are routinely warned about exposure to a wide range of consumer electronics, airport screening machines and other devices that generate electromagnetic fields.

Traces of tetrachloroethylene were found there last week. Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 The area in Queens where city officials found an industrial chemical in the drinking water last week has had problems with contamination by the same chemical for several years. The chemical — tetrachloroethylene, which is commonly used by dry cleaners and auto repair shops — has been detected sporadically in the water in Cambria Heights, Hollis and St. Albans every year since at least 2003, according to the New York City Department of Environmental Protection’s annual reports of drinking water quality. Anne Canty, the department’s deputy commissioner, said that testing yesterday detected continuing contamination, though at somewhat lower concentrations. Ten of 26 recent samples still contained traces of the colorless chemical, which has a sharp, sweet odor and is also known as perc. According to the federal , people who drink water containing tetrachloroethylene over many years can develop liver problems and may have an increased risk of . In New York City, the chemical is also considered an airborne hazard because many dry cleaners are inside residential buildings where fumes can seep through ceilings and walls. The city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene does not consider the amount of tetrachloroethylene in the water a serious health problem. People who remain concerned have been told to use bottled water for cooking and drinking and to take shorter showers. The contamination was detected last week during routine water testing. The city is required to notify water users if the average level of the chemical detected in water exceeds 5 parts per billion. As testing continued this week, some readings were as high as 13 parts per billion, more than double the maximum safe level. But as of late yesterday, the average level of the chemical had dropped to 3.7 parts per billion. Most of New York City gets drinking water from reservoirs 100 or more miles away and has not had a problem with the dry cleaning chemicals. But a five-and-a-half-mile section of southeastern Queens, which includes the area where the contamination was found, is sometimes served by a system of wells that are 100 to 360 feet deep. The wells belonged to a private water company until they were taken over by the city in 1996. Many have become contaminated with a variety of pollutants, including tetrachloroethylene, and can no longer be used. In 2005, five wells were in use, providing the neighborhood’s 100,000 residents with 2.2 million gallons of water a day, about 1 percent of the total used citywide every day. The wells had to be shut in February after pumps failed. The city plans to build a treatment plant for the wells, but construction is not scheduled to begin before 2009. Officials said that despite the recurring problem, they believed that the contaminated water found this week did not come from wells. An analysis of the chemical content of water indicated that it came from the main water system, officials said. Ms. Canty said water quality experts suspected that the current problem began with a faulty valve that failed to keep a small amount of chemical discharge from backing up into the drinking water system. Inspectors had checked about 300 dry cleaners and auto repair shops by midday yesterday, but the source of contamination was not discovered. In the meantime, Ms. Canty said, hydrants in the area were being flushed and the city expected the problem to be cleared up in a few days. In 2003, at least one sample of the well water in Queens exceeded 17 parts per billion. In both 2004 and 2005, tetrachloroethylene was detected in several samples and sometimes exceeded the safe level. But advisories were not issued in either year because the average of at least two consecutive readings fell below 5 parts per billion.

The bill would increase the fees paid by drug makers to help finance the work of the Food and Drug Administration and would give the agency new power to police company conduct. Industry lobbyists and executives said they supported the bill for one overriding reason: pink slips. Sometime this summer, if a bill has not passed, medical officers at the F.D.A. will start getting notices that they are in danger of being laid off by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Some of those officers are likely to be in the midst of reviewing new drug applications crucial to the future of drug makers. If those medical officers leave, drug approvals may be delayed &#151; a terrifying prospect for many companies. &#8220;The last thing we want is for F.D.A. employees to start thinking they may not have a job and start leaving,&#8221; said Alan R. Goldhammer, deputy vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for brand-name drug companies. In addition, many in the drug industry said they supported the bill because they believed that it would help restore public confidence in the nation&#8217;s drug supply. &#8220;There has been a loss of confidence in the F.D.A., and we can&#8217;t afford to have that,&#8221; said Dr. Joseph M. Feczko, Pfizer&#8217;s chief medical officer. &#8220;When our medicines come out, we want people to understand they have gone through a rigorous review process.&#8221; Under the bill, the F.D.A. could impose civil fines on companies that violated a drug safety plan or ran false or misleading advertisements. But major drug makers said they would comply with federal requirements, so the agency would not have reason to impose penalties on them. , Democrat of Massachusetts, was chief sponsor of the legislation, but Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, was equally responsible for its contents. In an unusual display of bipartisanship, they worked together to fend off amendments that would have made the bill unacceptable to the White House, raised the ire of the pharmaceutical industry or jeopardized chances for passage. &#8220;Kennedy and I have developed a trust,&#8221; Mr. Enzi said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t try to run over each other. We have a history of passing bills &#151; 27 signed by the president in the last two years.&#8221; An earlier version of the legislation was introduced by Mr. Enzi last August, when controlled Congress and he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. When Democrats took control this year and Mr. Kennedy became chairman of the committee, he kept his compact with Mr. Enzi. Working together, they steered the legislation through the committee and the full Senate. Along the way, they accepted dozens of changes proposed by lawmakers of both parties. Mr. Enzi, an accountant and former owner of a shoe store, was mayor of Gillette, Wyo., and served 10 years in the State Legislature. His quiet manner could hardly differ more from that of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Enzi is as conservative as Mr. Kennedy is liberal. But both are pragmatic legislative craftsmen. Mr. Enzi was recruited into politics by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, another Wyoming Republican who collaborated with Mr. Kennedy on many issues, including In an interview, Mr. Simpson said: &#8220;Mike is a legislator. He&#8217;s calm. He&#8217;s steady. He&#8217;s not a partisan kook or anything of that nature.&#8221; Mr. Simpson said Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy had &#8220;a mutual admiration society, built on trust, respect and friendship, with none of the savage partisanship&#8221; found elsewhere in American politics. Mr. Enzi holds the Senate seat once held by Mr. Simpson and his father, Milward L. Simpson, who entered the Senate on the same day as Mr. Kennedy, Nov. 7, 1962. &#8220;Teddy loved my dad,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, who nurtured the relationship between Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy. , Republican of New Hampshire, voted against the drug safety bill in the committee, but worked with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi to make changes that won his support for the legislation on the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a Ted Kennedy who is quite flamboyant and partisan in the theater of the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Gregg said in an interview. &#8220;And there is a Ted Kennedy who is extremely bipartisan and willing to work with people in the back rooms of the Senate.&#8221; Industry officials breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, that would effectively maintain the current ban on imported drugs. Drug makers fiercely oppose efforts to legalize imports of lower-cost medicines from Canada and other countries. Having won that fight, drug company executives said, they decided not to fight other provisions that they saw as less threatening. &#8220;They need to pick their battles,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. &#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t interfere with pricing and approvals is not going to hurt them seriously.&#8221; Still, many advocates, including some who support the bill&#8217;s passage, said the legislation was not the answer to the nation&#8217;s drug safety problems. &#8220;We have horrible leadership at the F.D.A., and they don&#8217;t even use the authorities they already have,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

She has constant discomfort in her neck that leads her to twist it in a birdlike fashion. Last year, a boy mimicked her in the lunch room. “The first time, I laughed it off,” Anya said. “I said: ‘That’s so funny. I think I’ll laugh with you.’ Then it got annoying, and I decided to hide it. I don’t want to be made fun of.” Now she slumps when seated at school to pressure her clenched muscles, she said. It all began in 2003 when Anya became dangerously thin. “Nothing tasted good to her,” Ms. Bailey said. This article is by Gardiner Harris, Benedict Carey and Janet Roberts.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/health/11heartweb.html?ex=1336536000&en=a6d34bf9f04bd9e0&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss	Electric Pulses, Instead of Shocks, Can Help Heart Patients - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior Electric Pulses, Instead of Shocks, Can Help Heart Patients Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 DENVER, May 10 — Many heart patients who believe that their lives have been saved by shocks from implanted could have survived without a jolt from the devices, according to research presented here today at a meeting of heart specialists. The devices can safely be programmed instead to rely on pacemaking features, which deliver a stream of electric pulses that patients do not feel, in many situations where they currently deliver the shocks, the study concluded. In fact, the data suggested that programming the devices to ignore some irregularities in a patient’s heartbeat and thus to deliver shocks less frequently might actually save lives. The study comes on top of well-known data that 80 percent or more of the patients who receive the defibrillators as protection against a seizure never need a shock. Now, with the new study concluding that even when the devices are thought to be saving lives they might be doing so in an unnecessarily harsh way, doctors are likely to be more worried than ever about their inability to figure out when patients truly need the devices and how best to use them. “A lot of these shocks should be classified as inappropriate,” said Dr. Bruce L. Wilkoff, a defibrillator expert from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who was the lead investigator and who presented the study results. Commenting on the lower death rate in the group of 700 patients whose devices were programmed to give shocks in fewer situations, Dr. Wilkoff said the difference was not statistically significant enough to ensure that the study’s approach was safer. But the trends in the data raised questions about whether unnecessary shocks weaken hearts in ways that raise the risks of death or hospitalization, he said. The new study was sponsored by Medtronic, the leading manufacturer of implanted defibrillators. It reflected the struggle among doctors to figure out the best uses of the expensive defibrillators. Other studies presented at the meeting explored specialized stress tests and minute differences in the behavior of hearts that might pinpoint which patients are most at risk of sudden cardiac arrest if they do not get defibrillators. The devices, which consist of a pocket-watch-size generator implanted in the chest and one to three leads inserted into the heart, cost as much as $50,000 to implant. Major clinical trials have shown that hundreds of thousands of Americans annually suffer from heart conditions — mainly a sharply reduced capacity to pump blood — that put them at risk for the kinds of breakdowns the defibrillators are designed to manage. Doctors believe that thousands of lives have been saved by the devices and that they should be more widely used. But the inability to figure out which patients are most at risk has slowed growth in the market, which was also hit in 2005 by news of malfunctions linked to a handful of deaths. Guidant, the manufacturer of the deadly devices, compounded the negative reaction by failing to disclose the problems promptly. Not all of the research reported here was weighty. The Heart Rhythm Society, the medical group that runs the annual meeting, also highlighted a small study by a Michigan high school student demonstrating that iPods can disrupt some functions of standard pacemakers when they are placed in a shirt pocket. The biggest impact among the 100 patients tested was a case in which the iPod caused the pacemaker to skip a few beats. Jay Thaker, the 17 year-old student who came up with the idea for the study, worked at with Dr. Krit Jongnarangsin, who has since moved to the The study was the first to focus on portable music players but did not surprise anyone at the meeting because of numerous studies in the past showing that other devices like cell phones have similar effects. Patients who get implants are routinely warned about exposure to a wide range of consumer electronics, airport screening machines and other devices that generate electromagnetic fields.

Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior F.D.A. Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 SILVER SPRING, Md., May 10 &#151; Bowing to safety concerns, government medical advisers urged on Thursday that additional restrictions be put on the use of drugs that treat The recommendations by an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration followed a flurry of studies suggesting that the drugs, meant to help patients cope with , might actually be making their cancer worse or hastening their deaths. The drugs &#151; Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &#38; Johnson &#151; are used by about a half-million American cancer patients a year and have billions of dollars in annual sales. Some members of the committee expressed shock that even though Procrit was first approved 14 years ago, it was still not clear if the drugs were safe at the doses typically used. &#8220;Yes, we have a burning question,&#8221; one panel member, Dr. Silvana Martino, an oncologist in Santa Monica, Calif., said at the meeting here. &#8220;Do these things kill people?&#8221; Most of the studies showing a risk involved use of the drugs at doses higher than doctors typically give them. That left the committee with the question of what to do about use of the drugs at the usual doses until more data become available. The F.D.A. has already clamped down on the drugs. In March it put strict new warnings on the labels, saying the products should be used at the smallest dosage that lets anemic patients avoid blood transfusions. But the panel&#8217;s votes Thursday portend even further restrictions. The committee voted 12 to 5, for instance, that the drugs should be barred from use by patients with certain types of cancer until more is known about their safety. While the committee did not specify which types, several members mentioned , non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. The committee voted 15 to 2 that there should be more restrictions in general if the drugs remain on the market, and 17 to 0 that more studies were needed. And it voted 16 to 1 that anemia therapy should be stopped when chemotherapy is finished. But in one victory for the drug makers, the committee voted 11 to 6 against lowering the ceiling on how much the anemia should be corrected. The labels now say that a patient&#8217;s hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells, should not be raised to more than 12 grams per deciliter of blood. The F.D.A. usually follows the recommendations of such panels. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the agency&#8217;s cancer drug division, said Thursday he could not say yet when or how the agency would act. The two drugs, along with another Amgen drug, Epogen, are also used to treat anemia caused by kidney disease, but yesterday&#8217;s meeting concerned only cancer treatment. Another hearing dealing with kidney disease will be held early in the fall. The panel&#8217;s recommendations were a particular blow to Amgen, which last year took in nearly half its $14.3 billion in revenue from the anemia drugs. Johnson &#38; Johnson is far larger and more diversified than Amgen, and so is less dependent on Procrit sales. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s worse than what investors expected,&#8221; Michael Aberman, an analyst who follows Amgen for Credit Suisse, said after the meeting. Amgen&#8217;s stock fell $5.77, or more than 9 percent, to close at $57.33. Trish Hawkins, an Amgen spokeswoman, said in a statement, &#8220;We will be working with the F.D.A. as they consider the committee&#8217;s recommendations.&#8221; The drugs, known generically as darbepoetin and epoetin, were approved to reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with anemia from chemotherapy. Many doctors and patients believe the drugs fight fatigue and improve patients&#8217; daily lives, although the F.D.A. said it did not find studies with persuasive evidence of such benefits. A panel member from , Dr. Otis Brawley, said some doctors overprescribed the drugs because they made money from doing so. Doctors can sometimes receive more from insurers than they pay for the drugs, especially if they receive rebates from the manufacturers. Dr. Brawley said the drug companies had not done proper studies, and at one point asked them, &#8220;What data do you have to assure me that this is not Miracle-Gro for cancer?&#8221; The staff of the F.D.A. was also critical of the companies, saying they had not provided data they had promised when a similar advisory panel meeting was held in 2004. The companies and their advocates argued that ample data showed the drugs were safe when used properly, except for a long-known risk of increased blood clots. They also argued that the drugs had significant benefits. Forcing cancer patients to go back to transfusions, they said, would expose the patients to risks and inconvenience and further strain the nation&#8217;s already taxed blood supply. That sentiment was also voiced by some committee members. &#8220;I think the idea of going back to the dark ages in regards to supportive care is a step backward,&#8221; said Dr. S. Gail Eckhardt of the , the panel&#8217;s chairman. Advisory panel meetings often feature eloquent pleas from patients that a drug be approved or kept on the market. But there was not a big outpouring of support for the anemia drugs. In fact, some patients expressed dismay at how the drugs were used. &#8220;How is it possible that what was meant to help me might actually have made things worse?&#8221; said Lilla Romeo, who has had breast cancer since 1995.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/us/11milk.html	Dairy Council to End Ad Campaign That Linked Drinking Milk With Weight Loss - New York Times Dairy Council to End Ad Campaign That Linked Drinking Milk With Weight Loss Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 A national advertising campaign that associates dairy products with weight loss will be curtailed because research does not support the claim, according to the Federal Trade Commission. The advertisements, conceived by the promotional arm of the dairy industry and overseen by the Agriculture Department, feature slogans like &#8220;Milk your . Lose weight!&#8221; and suggest that three servings of dairy products a day can help people be slim. The effort includes a campaign called &#8220;Body by Milk&#8221; that is aimed at teenagers. It features Alex Rodriguez, the third baseman for the New York Yankees, and Carrie Underwood, an &#8220;American Idol&#8221; winner. The assertion that there is a link between weight loss and dairy consumption has long been contested by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy and research group that promotes a diet free of animal products. The group petitioned the F.T.C. in 2005 to argue that the advertisements were misleading. In a May 3 letter to the group, Lydia Parnes, director of the agency&#8217;s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Agriculture Department representatives and milk producers and processors had agreed to change the advertisements and related marketing materials &#8220;until further research provides stronger, more conclusive evidence of an association between dairy consumption and weight loss.&#8221; As of Thursday, the National Dairy Council still had a section of its Web site devoted to the weight-loss claim. But the site, along with some of the advertisements, will be changed, said Greg Miller, who is executive vice president of the council and has a doctorate in nutrition. &#8220;Like any other marketing campaign, after time you want to freshen them up and give the consumers what&#8217;s new,&#8221; Mr. Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.&#8221; Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the group that brought the matter to the F.T.C., said it would continue to press the dairy industry on other claims, which include the assertion that calcium helps prevent bone fractures in older women. &#8220;I think people will start to recognize that the dairy industry, which used to have a mom-and-pop image, is a huge commercial entity that will exaggerate to sell its products,&#8221; Dr. Barnard said. Mr. Miller said most medical professionals agreed that dairy contributed to overall bone health and could help people maintain a healthy weight. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a minority of people out there that just have very loud voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a vegan group that doesn&#8217;t want anyone to eat dairy.&#8221; Dairy products were upgraded in the 2005 revision of federal dietary guidelines, which recommended that people consume more low-fat milk and dairy products. An advisory committee that helped set the guidelines cited a report, partly financed by the dairy industry, which found that low-fat dairy products did not necessarily add to weight gain and that dairy products have certain nutrients that can help consumers meet dietary recommendations. The guidelines increased the amount of low-fat or fat-free dairy products to three cups a day, up from two cups. The dairy council is allowed to continue to use wording from those guidelines that says adults and children should not avoid milk and milk products because of concerns that they may lead to weight gain, the letter from the F.T.C. said. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at , said the agreement to modify the advertisements was groundbreaking. In her book, &#8220;What to Eat,&#8221; she argued that lobbying by the $50 billion dairy industry could sometimes cloud policy on nutrition. Though Ms. Nestle said she ate dairy products regularly and did not dispute their nutritional value, she said people could have a healthy diet without them. &#8220;Those ads were ridiculously misleading,&#8221; she said.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/washington/11fda.html	Passage of Drug Safety Bill Was Common Goal for Two Very Different Senators - New York Times Passage of Drug Safety Bill Was Common Goal for Two Very Different Senators Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 &#151; Legislation to beef up drug safety, passed by the Senate this week with only one dissenting vote, grew out of an extraordinary pact between two senators and a frantic effort by the pharmaceutical industry to avoid any disruption in the approval of new drugs. The bill would increase the fees paid by drug makers to help finance the work of the Food and Drug Administration and would give the agency new power to police company conduct. Industry lobbyists and executives said they supported the bill for one overriding reason: pink slips. Sometime this summer, if a bill has not passed, medical officers at the F.D.A. will start getting notices that they are in danger of being laid off by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Some of those officers are likely to be in the midst of reviewing new drug applications crucial to the future of drug makers. If those medical officers leave, drug approvals may be delayed &#151; a terrifying prospect for many companies. &#8220;The last thing we want is for F.D.A. employees to start thinking they may not have a job and start leaving,&#8221; said Alan R. Goldhammer, deputy vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for brand-name drug companies. In addition, many in the drug industry said they supported the bill because they believed that it would help restore public confidence in the nation&#8217;s drug supply. &#8220;There has been a loss of confidence in the F.D.A., and we can&#8217;t afford to have that,&#8221; said Dr. Joseph M. Feczko, Pfizer&#8217;s chief medical officer. &#8220;When our medicines come out, we want people to understand they have gone through a rigorous review process.&#8221; Under the bill, the F.D.A. could impose civil fines on companies that violated a drug safety plan or ran false or misleading advertisements. But major drug makers said they would comply with federal requirements, so the agency would not have reason to impose penalties on them. , Democrat of Massachusetts, was chief sponsor of the legislation, but Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, was equally responsible for its contents. In an unusual display of bipartisanship, they worked together to fend off amendments that would have made the bill unacceptable to the White House, raised the ire of the pharmaceutical industry or jeopardized chances for passage. &#8220;Kennedy and I have developed a trust,&#8221; Mr. Enzi said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t try to run over each other. We have a history of passing bills &#151; 27 signed by the president in the last two years.&#8221; An earlier version of the legislation was introduced by Mr. Enzi last August, when controlled Congress and he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. When Democrats took control this year and Mr. Kennedy became chairman of the committee, he kept his compact with Mr. Enzi. Working together, they steered the legislation through the committee and the full Senate. Along the way, they accepted dozens of changes proposed by lawmakers of both parties. Mr. Enzi, an accountant and former owner of a shoe store, was mayor of Gillette, Wyo., and served 10 years in the State Legislature. His quiet manner could hardly differ more from that of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Enzi is as conservative as Mr. Kennedy is liberal. But both are pragmatic legislative craftsmen. Mr. Enzi was recruited into politics by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, another Wyoming Republican who collaborated with Mr. Kennedy on many issues, including In an interview, Mr. Simpson said: &#8220;Mike is a legislator. He&#8217;s calm. He&#8217;s steady. He&#8217;s not a partisan kook or anything of that nature.&#8221; Mr. Simpson said Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy had &#8220;a mutual admiration society, built on trust, respect and friendship, with none of the savage partisanship&#8221; found elsewhere in American politics. Mr. Enzi holds the Senate seat once held by Mr. Simpson and his father, Milward L. Simpson, who entered the Senate on the same day as Mr. Kennedy, Nov. 7, 1962. &#8220;Teddy loved my dad,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, who nurtured the relationship between Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy. , Republican of New Hampshire, voted against the drug safety bill in the committee, but worked with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi to make changes that won his support for the legislation on the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a Ted Kennedy who is quite flamboyant and partisan in the theater of the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Gregg said in an interview. &#8220;And there is a Ted Kennedy who is extremely bipartisan and willing to work with people in the back rooms of the Senate.&#8221; Industry officials breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, that would effectively maintain the current ban on imported drugs. Drug makers fiercely oppose efforts to legalize imports of lower-cost medicines from Canada and other countries. Having won that fight, drug company executives said, they decided not to fight other provisions that they saw as less threatening. &#8220;They need to pick their battles,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. &#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t interfere with pricing and approvals is not going to hurt them seriously.&#8221; Still, many advocates, including some who support the bill&#8217;s passage, said the legislation was not the answer to the nation&#8217;s drug safety problems. &#8220;We have horrible leadership at the F.D.A., and they don&#8217;t even use the authorities they already have,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

The advertisements, conceived by the promotional arm of the dairy industry and overseen by the Agriculture Department, feature slogans like &#8220;Milk your . Lose weight!&#8221; and suggest that three servings of dairy products a day can help people be slim. The effort includes a campaign called &#8220;Body by Milk&#8221; that is aimed at teenagers. It features Alex Rodriguez, the third baseman for the New York Yankees, and Carrie Underwood, an &#8220;American Idol&#8221; winner. The assertion that there is a link between weight loss and dairy consumption has long been contested by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy and research group that promotes a diet free of animal products. The group petitioned the F.T.C. in 2005 to argue that the advertisements were misleading. In a May 3 letter to the group, Lydia Parnes, director of the agency&#8217;s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Agriculture Department representatives and milk producers and processors had agreed to change the advertisements and related marketing materials &#8220;until further research provides stronger, more conclusive evidence of an association between dairy consumption and weight loss.&#8221; As of Thursday, the National Dairy Council still had a section of its Web site devoted to the weight-loss claim. But the site, along with some of the advertisements, will be changed, said Greg Miller, who is executive vice president of the council and has a doctorate in nutrition. &#8220;Like any other marketing campaign, after time you want to freshen them up and give the consumers what&#8217;s new,&#8221; Mr. Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.&#8221; Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the group that brought the matter to the F.T.C., said it would continue to press the dairy industry on other claims, which include the assertion that calcium helps prevent bone fractures in older women. &#8220;I think people will start to recognize that the dairy industry, which used to have a mom-and-pop image, is a huge commercial entity that will exaggerate to sell its products,&#8221; Dr. Barnard said. Mr. Miller said most medical professionals agreed that dairy contributed to overall bone health and could help people maintain a healthy weight. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a minority of people out there that just have very loud voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a vegan group that doesn&#8217;t want anyone to eat dairy.&#8221; Dairy products were upgraded in the 2005 revision of federal dietary guidelines, which recommended that people consume more low-fat milk and dairy products. An advisory committee that helped set the guidelines cited a report, partly financed by the dairy industry, which found that low-fat dairy products did not necessarily add to weight gain and that dairy products have certain nutrients that can help consumers meet dietary recommendations. The guidelines increased the amount of low-fat or fat-free dairy products to three cups a day, up from two cups. The dairy council is allowed to continue to use wording from those guidelines that says adults and children should not avoid milk and milk products because of concerns that they may lead to weight gain, the letter from the F.T.C. said. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at , said the agreement to modify the advertisements was groundbreaking. In her book, &#8220;What to Eat,&#8221; she argued that lobbying by the $50 billion dairy industry could sometimes cloud policy on nutrition. Though Ms. Nestle said she ate dairy products regularly and did not dispute their nutritional value, she said people could have a healthy diet without them. &#8220;Those ads were ridiculously misleading,&#8221; she said.

The doctor, Jos&#233; L. Covarrubias, was arrested at the Mexican border on Wednesday as he tried to enter the United Stated. He was indicted the same day in connection with a marijuana-dealing ring based here. The indictment says Dr. Covarrubias surgically removed the fingerprints of Marc George, a co-defendant named in the drug indictment. The doctor is believed to have performed the surgery for about four other people, said William Behe, an assistant United States attorney. &#8220;We heard those stories,&#8221; Mr. Behe said, &#8220;but we didn&#8217;t believe them when we heard them during the course of the investigation. We caught Marc George, and we all became believers.&#8221; Mr. Behe said Mr. George&#8217;s hands were still mangled from the procedure, which the authorities believe Dr. Covarrubias did in mid-2005. Dr. Covarrubias, 49, was charged with conspiring to distribute more than a ton of marijuana in central Pennsylvania and elsewhere and with being an accomplice and accessory after the fact to marijuana dealing. He is a Mexican citizen and lives in both Nogales, , and Nogales, Ariz. The charges are the result of an investigation into a drug ring based here. Thirty-four people have been charged, and 27 have pleaded guilty or are expected to plead guilty. Mr. George, 42, of Jamaica, was indicted on charges of money laundering and drug trafficking.

The doctor, Jos&#233; L. Covarrubias, was arrested at the Mexican border on Wednesday as he tried to enter the United Stated. He was indicted the same day in connection with a marijuana-dealing ring based here.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/health/11heartweb.html	Electric Pulses, Instead of Shocks, Can Help Heart Patients - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior Electric Pulses, Instead of Shocks, Can Help Heart Patients Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 DENVER, May 10 — Many heart patients who believe that their lives have been saved by shocks from implanted could have survived without a jolt from the devices, according to research presented here today at a meeting of heart specialists. The devices can safely be programmed instead to rely on pacemaking features, which deliver a stream of electric pulses that patients do not feel, in many situations where they currently deliver the shocks, the study concluded. In fact, the data suggested that programming the devices to ignore some irregularities in a patient’s heartbeat and thus to deliver shocks less frequently might actually save lives. The study comes on top of well-known data that 80 percent or more of the patients who receive the defibrillators as protection against a seizure never need a shock. Now, with the new study concluding that even when the devices are thought to be saving lives they might be doing so in an unnecessarily harsh way, doctors are likely to be more worried than ever about their inability to figure out when patients truly need the devices and how best to use them. “A lot of these shocks should be classified as inappropriate,” said Dr. Bruce L. Wilkoff, a defibrillator expert from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who was the lead investigator and who presented the study results. Commenting on the lower death rate in the group of 700 patients whose devices were programmed to give shocks in fewer situations, Dr. Wilkoff said the difference was not statistically significant enough to ensure that the study’s approach was safer. But the trends in the data raised questions about whether unnecessary shocks weaken hearts in ways that raise the risks of death or hospitalization, he said. The new study was sponsored by Medtronic, the leading manufacturer of implanted defibrillators. It reflected the struggle among doctors to figure out the best uses of the expensive defibrillators. Other studies presented at the meeting explored specialized stress tests and minute differences in the behavior of hearts that might pinpoint which patients are most at risk of sudden cardiac arrest if they do not get defibrillators. The devices, which consist of a pocket-watch-size generator implanted in the chest and one to three leads inserted into the heart, cost as much as $50,000 to implant. Major clinical trials have shown that hundreds of thousands of Americans annually suffer from heart conditions — mainly a sharply reduced capacity to pump blood — that put them at risk for the kinds of breakdowns the defibrillators are designed to manage. Doctors believe that thousands of lives have been saved by the devices and that they should be more widely used. But the inability to figure out which patients are most at risk has slowed growth in the market, which was also hit in 2005 by news of malfunctions linked to a handful of deaths. Guidant, the manufacturer of the deadly devices, compounded the negative reaction by failing to disclose the problems promptly. Not all of the research reported here was weighty. The Heart Rhythm Society, the medical group that runs the annual meeting, also highlighted a small study by a Michigan high school student demonstrating that iPods can disrupt some functions of standard pacemakers when they are placed in a shirt pocket. The biggest impact among the 100 patients tested was a case in which the iPod caused the pacemaker to skip a few beats. Jay Thaker, the 17 year-old student who came up with the idea for the study, worked at with Dr. Krit Jongnarangsin, who has since moved to the The study was the first to focus on portable music players but did not surprise anyone at the meeting because of numerous studies in the past showing that other devices like cell phones have similar effects.

The bill would increase the fees paid by drug makers to help finance the work of the Food and Drug Administration and would give the agency new power to police company conduct. Industry lobbyists and executives said they supported the bill for one overriding reason: pink slips. Sometime this summer, if a bill has not passed, medical officers at the F.D.A. will start getting notices that they are in danger of being laid off by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Some of those officers are likely to be in the midst of reviewing new drug applications crucial to the future of drug makers. If those medical officers leave, drug approvals may be delayed &#151; a terrifying prospect for many companies. &#8220;The last thing we want is for F.D.A. employees to start thinking they may not have a job and start leaving,&#8221; said Alan R. Goldhammer, deputy vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for brand-name drug companies. In addition, many in the drug industry said they supported the bill because they believed that it would help restore public confidence in the nation&#8217;s drug supply. &#8220;There has been a loss of confidence in the F.D.A., and we can&#8217;t afford to have that,&#8221; said Dr. Joseph M. Feczko, Pfizer&#8217;s chief medical officer. &#8220;When our medicines come out, we want people to understand they have gone through a rigorous review process.&#8221; Under the bill, the F.D.A. could impose civil fines on companies that violated a drug safety plan or ran false or misleading advertisements. But major drug makers said they would comply with federal requirements, so the agency would not have reason to impose penalties on them. , Democrat of Massachusetts, was chief sponsor of the legislation, but Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, was equally responsible for its contents. In an unusual display of bipartisanship, they worked together to fend off amendments that would have made the bill unacceptable to the White House, raised the ire of the pharmaceutical industry or jeopardized chances for passage. &#8220;Kennedy and I have developed a trust,&#8221; Mr. Enzi said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t try to run over each other. We have a history of passing bills &#151; 27 signed by the president in the last two years.&#8221; An earlier version of the legislation was introduced by Mr. Enzi last August, when controlled Congress and he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. When Democrats took control this year and Mr. Kennedy became chairman of the committee, he kept his compact with Mr. Enzi. Working together, they steered the legislation through the committee and the full Senate. Along the way, they accepted dozens of changes proposed by lawmakers of both parties. Mr. Enzi, an accountant and former owner of a shoe store, was mayor of Gillette, Wyo., and served 10 years in the State Legislature. His quiet manner could hardly differ more from that of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Enzi is as conservative as Mr. Kennedy is liberal. But both are pragmatic legislative craftsmen. Mr. Enzi was recruited into politics by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, another Wyoming Republican who collaborated with Mr. Kennedy on many issues, including In an interview, Mr. Simpson said: &#8220;Mike is a legislator. He&#8217;s calm. He&#8217;s steady. He&#8217;s not a partisan kook or anything of that nature.&#8221; Mr. Simpson said Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy had &#8220;a mutual admiration society, built on trust, respect and friendship, with none of the savage partisanship&#8221; found elsewhere in American politics. Mr. Enzi holds the Senate seat once held by Mr. Simpson and his father, Milward L. Simpson, who entered the Senate on the same day as Mr. Kennedy, Nov. 7, 1962. &#8220;Teddy loved my dad,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, who nurtured the relationship between Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy. , Republican of New Hampshire, voted against the drug safety bill in the committee, but worked with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi to make changes that won his support for the legislation on the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a Ted Kennedy who is quite flamboyant and partisan in the theater of the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Gregg said in an interview. &#8220;And there is a Ted Kennedy who is extremely bipartisan and willing to work with people in the back rooms of the Senate.&#8221; Industry officials breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, that would effectively maintain the current ban on imported drugs. Drug makers fiercely oppose efforts to legalize imports of lower-cost medicines from Canada and other countries. Having won that fight, drug company executives said, they decided not to fight other provisions that they saw as less threatening. &#8220;They need to pick their battles,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. &#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t interfere with pricing and approvals is not going to hurt them seriously.&#8221; Still, many advocates, including some who support the bill&#8217;s passage, said the legislation was not the answer to the nation&#8217;s drug safety problems. &#8220;We have horrible leadership at the F.D.A., and they don&#8217;t even use the authorities they already have,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

Feczko, Pfizer&#8217;s chief medical officer. &#8220;When our medicines come out, we want people to understand they have gone through a rigorous review process.&#8221; Under the bill, the F.D.A. could impose civil fines on companies that violated a drug safety plan or ran false or misleading advertisements. But major drug makers said they would comply with federal requirements, so the agency would not have reason to impose penalties on them. , Democrat of Massachusetts, was chief sponsor of the legislation, but Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, was equally responsible for its contents. In an unusual display of bipartisanship, they worked together to fend off amendments that would have made the bill unacceptable to the White House, raised the ire of the pharmaceutical industry or jeopardized chances for passage. &#8220;Kennedy and I have developed a trust,&#8221; Mr. Enzi said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t try to run over each other. We have a history of passing bills &#151; 27 signed by the president in the last two years.&#8221; An earlier version of the legislation was introduced by Mr. Enzi last August, when controlled Congress and he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. When Democrats took control this year and Mr. Kennedy became chairman of the committee, he kept his compact with Mr. Enzi. Working together, they steered the legislation through the committee and the full Senate. Along the way, they accepted dozens of changes proposed by lawmakers of both parties. Mr. Enzi, an accountant and former owner of a shoe store, was mayor of Gillette, Wyo., and served 10 years in the State Legislature. His quiet manner could hardly differ more from that of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Enzi is as conservative as Mr. Kennedy is liberal. But both are pragmatic legislative craftsmen. Mr. Enzi was recruited into politics by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, another Wyoming Republican who collaborated with Mr. Kennedy on many issues, including In an interview, Mr. Simpson said: &#8220;Mike is a legislator. He&#8217;s calm. He&#8217;s steady. He&#8217;s not a partisan kook or anything of that nature.&#8221; Mr. Simpson said Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy had &#8220;a mutual admiration society, built on trust, respect and friendship, with none of the savage partisanship&#8221; found elsewhere in American politics. Mr. Enzi holds the Senate seat once held by Mr. Simpson and his father, Milward L. Simpson, who entered the Senate on the same day as Mr. Kennedy, Nov. 7, 1962. &#8220;Teddy loved my dad,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, who nurtured the relationship between Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy. , Republican of New Hampshire, voted against the drug safety bill in the committee, but worked with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi to make changes that won his support for the legislation on the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a Ted Kennedy who is quite flamboyant and partisan in the theater of the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Gregg said in an interview. &#8220;And there is a Ted Kennedy who is extremely bipartisan and willing to work with people in the back rooms of the Senate.&#8221; Industry officials breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, that would effectively maintain the current ban on imported drugs. Drug makers fiercely oppose efforts to legalize imports of lower-cost medicines from Canada and other countries. Having won that fight, drug company executives said, they decided not to fight other provisions that they saw as less threatening. &#8220;They need to pick their battles,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. &#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t interfere with pricing and approvals is not going to hurt them seriously.&#8221; Still, many advocates, including some who support the bill&#8217;s passage, said the legislation was not the answer to the nation&#8217;s drug safety problems. &#8220;We have horrible leadership at the F.D.A., and they don&#8217;t even use the authorities they already have,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

The devices can safely be programmed instead to rely on pacemaking features, which deliver a stream of electric pulses that patients do not feel, in many situations where they currently deliver the shocks, the study concluded. In fact, the data suggested that programming the devices to ignore some irregularities in a patient’s heartbeat and thus to deliver shocks less frequently might actually save lives. The study comes on top of well-known data that 80 percent or more of the patients who receive the defibrillators as protection against a seizure never need a shock. Now, with the new study concluding that even when the devices are thought to be saving lives they might be doing so in an unnecessarily harsh way, doctors are likely to be more worried than ever about their inability to figure out when patients truly need the devices and how best to use them. “A lot of these shocks should be classified as inappropriate,” said Dr. Bruce L. Wilkoff, a defibrillator expert from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation who was the lead investigator and who presented the study results. Commenting on the lower death rate in the group of 700 patients whose devices were programmed to give shocks in fewer situations, Dr. Wilkoff said the difference was not statistically significant enough to ensure that the study’s approach was safer. But the trends in the data raised questions about whether unnecessary shocks weaken hearts in ways that raise the risks of death or hospitalization, he said. The new study was sponsored by Medtronic, the leading manufacturer of implanted defibrillators. It reflected the struggle among doctors to figure out the best uses of the expensive defibrillators. Other studies presented at the meeting explored specialized stress tests and minute differences in the behavior of hearts that might pinpoint which patients are most at risk of sudden cardiac arrest if they do not get defibrillators. The devices, which consist of a pocket-watch-size generator implanted in the chest and one to three leads inserted into the heart, cost as much as $50,000 to implant. Major clinical trials have shown that hundreds of thousands of Americans annually suffer from heart conditions — mainly a sharply reduced capacity to pump blood — that put them at risk for the kinds of breakdowns the defibrillators are designed to manage. Doctors believe that thousands of lives have been saved by the devices and that they should be more widely used. But the inability to figure out which patients are most at risk has slowed growth in the market, which was also hit in 2005 by news of malfunctions linked to a handful of deaths. Guidant, the manufacturer of the deadly devices, compounded the negative reaction by failing to disclose the problems promptly. Not all of the research reported here was weighty. The Heart Rhythm Society, the medical group that runs the annual meeting, also highlighted a small study by a Michigan high school student demonstrating that iPods can disrupt some functions of standard pacemakers when they are placed in a shirt pocket. The biggest impact among the 100 patients tested was a case in which the iPod caused the pacemaker to skip a few beats. Jay Thaker, the 17 year-old student who came up with the idea for the study, worked at with Dr. Krit Jongnarangsin, who has since moved to the The study was the first to focus on portable music players but did not surprise anyone at the meeting because of numerous studies in the past showing that other devices like cell phones have similar effects. Patients who get implants are routinely warned about exposure to a wide range of consumer electronics, airport screening machines and other devices that generate electromagnetic fields.

Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 12, 2007 CONCORD, N.H. — A vaccine for a sexually transmitted virus that causes cervical may be creating controversy across the country, but in physicians say so many people want it that they cannot satisfy the demand. Skip to next paragraph Cheryl Senter/The New York Times Gardasil, given in three doses over six months, costs $360. The New Hampshire experience contrasts sharply with that in many other states, where opponents have cited factors like the drug manufacturer’s profit motive and the fear that inoculating young girls will encourage them to be sexually active. New Hampshire has critics of the vaccine, too. But its health officials, wanting to encourage use of the vaccine, called Gardasil, say they have hit on an optimal method: making it voluntary and giving it free to girls ages 11 to 18. In many of the more than 20 states that are considering bills to require girls to be vaccinated, a backlash has developed. In , a lawmakers’ revolt overwhelmingly overturned Gov. ’s effort to mandate recently became the sole state with a law requiring the vaccine for girls entering the sixth grade but allowing parents to refuse shots for their children. In New Hampshire, where people wear their independent streaks with pride, “I suspect that we’re not seeing a significant controversy because there was a never a discussion about whether to make this mandatory,” said Greg Moore, a spokesman for the Health and Human Services Department “This is a different type of vaccine rollout than we have ever seen,” Mr. Moore said. “We usually have to bust our hump every September to convince people to get their Sanders Family Medicine in Concord has a four-month waiting list for the vaccine, which guards against four strains of the . Exeter Pediatric Associates, one of the state’s largest practices, has given out all 380 doses it was supplied by the state since January and has a long waiting list for the next month’s supply, Dr. Wendy Gladstone said. Penacook Family Physicians has devised an elaborate triage system. Ardell Currier, a nurse practitioner, said Penacook first vaccinated 18-year-olds and then younger girls who have been sexually active, take birth control and “have had an or have had health issues, particularly psychiatric conditions” that may make them more likely to have sex. “The ethical dilemma is whom do we give that vaccine to,” Ms. Currier said. New Hampshire is spending $4.9 million on Gardasil this year, said Dr. Jose Montero, the state epidemiologist. That is 28 percent of the state immunization budget, which obtains half its financing from federal money and half from private insurers, Dr. Montero said. The legislature does not have to vote on the program or appropriate money, he added. Money for other immunization programs was not reduced, he said. Since January, the state has distributed more than 14,000 doses and is trying to obtain more doses for physicians with waiting lists. Dr. Montero said he would evaluate whether to ask for more money to buy more vaccine. At least two other states, South Dakota and Washington, are echoing the program here. South Dakota began providing Gardasil free to the same age group in late January with $1.7 million approved by the Legislature and $7.5 million in federal money, Health Secretary Doneen Hollingsworth said. South Dakota is a relatively conservative state that tried last year to ban most abortions only to have the ban repealed in a referendum. Even so, when it came to the HPV vaccine, Ms. Hollingsworth said, “the naysayers, there weren’t a lot of them, and they weren’t terribly loud.” Ms. Hollingsworth said the state had provided almost 20,000 doses. “There’s been a tremendous amount of interest,” she added. “But I haven’t heard anything about anybody running out” of vaccine. In Washington, the Llegislature just approved $10 million for voluntary vaccination for 94,000 girls over the next two years. “We basically want to see as many people get this as possible,” said Tim Church, a spokesman for the Health Department who said Washington would primarily focus on 11- and 12-year-olds on the theory that it is best to be vaccinated before being sexually active. The cost of Gardasil, which is administered in three doses over six months, is normally $360. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend it for ages 9 to 26. In New Hampshire, girls outside the 11-to-18 range of the free pool have to pay out of pocket or through insurance. Some families of 11- to 18-year-olds have been doing that, rather than wait for the free vaccine. Physicians say the supply of vaccine for patients who are paying for it themselves or through insurance, produced by Merck, has been adequate. Exeter Pediatric Associates has given 480 doses of privately ordered vaccine since December, Dr. Gladstone said. Even women older than 26 are requesting it. Starting in July, the biggest insurer in the state, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, will not cover vaccines for HPV and other illnesses for 11- to 18-year-olds because they are eligible for the free pool, which receives money from Anthem, said a spokesman, Chris Dugan. Other insurers are expected to do the same, Mr. Dugan said. Doctors said that could increase the backlog for the free vaccine. Melissa Whitney of Hampstead has put her 13- and 11-year-olds on the waiting list at Exeter. “They said there were many people ahead of me, and, ‘As soon as we get some more vaccine in, we’ll give you a call,’ ” Ms. Whitney said. On Wednesday, Sophia Wheat, 16, received her second injection at Sanders Family Medicine, a few weeks later than the optimal time because of the limited supply, said Dr. Elizabeth Sanders, who is careful to inform patients that Gardasil is not effective against all strains of HPV or other “It sounded really important, so I thought it would be a good idea,” Sophia said as a medical assistant placed a yellow crayon-shaped bandage on her arm. To sort through waiting lists, some doctors give priority to older girls, some to younger ones and some to girls who have already received a dose. Yet, not everyone is rushing for the vaccine. Ms. Currier at Penacook Family Physicians said her practice had called all its 18-year-olds first, especially to recruit “the folks most at risk for HPV, because they are going to be not those most engaged in health care.” About half the 18-year-olds or their parents refused it, “most because they feel it’s too new,” Ms. Currier said. “Some parents of younger girls feel that they’re not sexually active, so they don’t need it,” she added. Maggie Theriault, a nurse from Merrimack, declined Gardasil for her 14-year-old, Samantha, because “I haven’t really investigated it all that much.” “When I did hear about it originally,” Ms. Theriault said, “I wanted her to have it. But I don’t want to be ignorant and I don’t want to rush. “She’s not sexually active yet . We have an agreement that she’s not going to be until, hopefully, she’s at least 18. I’m not saying that we won’t ever get it. It’s just that we’re going to wait a bit.” When Kimberly Barlow arranged for three of her daughters, ages 18, 15, and 13, to receive the inoculation, “my mom was actually against me getting it for them,” Ms. Barlow said. “She was saying it would lead to their promiscuity and stuff,” Ms. Barlow said. “I just thought that it was an option to do something that will likely prevent cervical cancer in my children.” Pauline Doucette put her daughter Olivia, 13, a volleyball player and karate fan, on her pediatrician’s list in October, three months before it was available. Olivia’s grandmother had cervical cancer, which is not hereditary, and Ms. Doucette had a precancerous condition, making Olivia aware of the illness. Ms. Doucette said she discussed the sexual transmission of the virus with Olivia, who has received two doses. “Most everybody in school,” Olivia said, “is getting the shot.” Next Article in Health (1 of 16) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

On Wednesday, Sophia Wheat, 16, received her second injection at Sanders Family Medicine, a few weeks later than the optimal time because of the limited supply, said Dr. Elizabeth Sanders, who is careful to inform patients that Gardasil is not effective against all strains of HPV or other “It sounded really important, so I thought it would be a good idea,” Sophia said as a medical assistant placed a yellow crayon-shaped bandage on her arm. To sort through waiting lists, some doctors give priority to older girls, some to younger ones and some to girls who have already received a dose. Yet, not everyone is rushing for the vaccine. Ms. Currier at Penacook Family Physicians said her practice had called all its 18-year-olds first, especially to recruit “the folks most at risk for HPV, because they are going to be not those most engaged in health care.” About half the 18-year-olds or their parents refused it, “most because they feel it’s too new,” Ms. Currier said. “Some parents of younger girls feel that they’re not sexually active, so they don’t need it,” she added. Maggie Theriault, a nurse from Merrimack, declined Gardasil for her 14-year-old, Samantha, because “I haven’t really investigated it all that much.” “When I did hear about it originally,” Ms. Theriault said, “I wanted her to have it. But I don’t want to be ignorant and I don’t want to rush. “She’s not sexually active yet . We have an agreement that she’s not going to be until, hopefully, she’s at least 18. I’m not saying that we won’t ever get it. It’s just that we’re going to wait a bit.” When Kimberly Barlow arranged for three of her daughters, ages 18, 15, and 13, to receive the inoculation, “my mom was actually against me getting it for them,” Ms. Barlow said. “She was saying it would lead to their promiscuity and stuff,” Ms. Barlow said. “I just thought that it was an option to do something that will likely prevent cervical cancer in my children.” Pauline Doucette put her daughter Olivia, 13, a volleyball player and karate fan, on her pediatrician’s list in October, three months before it was available. Olivia’s grandmother had cervical cancer, which is not hereditary, and Ms. Doucette had a precancerous condition, making Olivia aware of the illness. Ms. Doucette said she discussed the sexual transmission of the virus with Olivia, who has received two doses. “Most everybody in school,” Olivia said, “is getting the shot.” Next Article in Health (1 of 16) &#x00bb; Need to know more? 50% off home delivery of The Times.

The advertisements, conceived by the promotional arm of the dairy industry and overseen by the Agriculture Department, feature slogans like &#8220;Milk your . Lose weight!&#8221; and suggest that three servings of dairy products a day can help people be slim. The effort includes a campaign called &#8220;Body by Milk&#8221; that is aimed at teenagers. It features Alex Rodriguez, the third baseman for the New York Yankees, and Carrie Underwood, an &#8220;American Idol&#8221; winner. The assertion that there is a link between weight loss and dairy consumption has long been contested by the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, an advocacy and research group that promotes a diet free of animal products. The group petitioned the F.T.C. in 2005 to argue that the advertisements were misleading. In a May 3 letter to the group, Lydia Parnes, director of the agency&#8217;s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said Agriculture Department representatives and milk producers and processors had agreed to change the advertisements and related marketing materials &#8220;until further research provides stronger, more conclusive evidence of an association between dairy consumption and weight loss.&#8221; As of Thursday, the National Dairy Council still had a section of its Web site devoted to the weight-loss claim. But the site, along with some of the advertisements, will be changed, said Greg Miller, who is executive vice president of the council and has a doctorate in nutrition. &#8220;Like any other marketing campaign, after time you want to freshen them up and give the consumers what&#8217;s new,&#8221; Mr. Miller said. &#8220;That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening here.&#8221; Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the group that brought the matter to the F.T.C., said it would continue to press the dairy industry on other claims, which include the assertion that calcium helps prevent bone fractures in older women. &#8220;I think people will start to recognize that the dairy industry, which used to have a mom-and-pop image, is a huge commercial entity that will exaggerate to sell its products,&#8221; Dr. Barnard said. Mr. Miller said most medical professionals agreed that dairy contributed to overall bone health and could help people maintain a healthy weight. &#8220;I think there&#8217;s a minority of people out there that just have very loud voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This is a vegan group that doesn&#8217;t want anyone to eat dairy.&#8221; Dairy products were upgraded in the 2005 revision of federal dietary guidelines, which recommended that people consume more low-fat milk and dairy products. An advisory committee that helped set the guidelines cited a report, partly financed by the dairy industry, which found that low-fat dairy products did not necessarily add to weight gain and that dairy products have certain nutrients that can help consumers meet dietary recommendations. The guidelines increased the amount of low-fat or fat-free dairy products to three cups a day, up from two cups. The dairy council is allowed to continue to use wording from those guidelines that says adults and children should not avoid milk and milk products because of concerns that they may lead to weight gain, the letter from the F.T.C. said. Marion Nestle, a professor of nutrition at , said the agreement to modify the advertisements was groundbreaking. In her book, &#8220;What to Eat,&#8221; she argued that lobbying by the $50 billion dairy industry could sometimes cloud policy on nutrition. Though Ms. Nestle said she ate dairy products regularly and did not dispute their nutritional value, she said people could have a healthy diet without them. &#8220;Those ads were ridiculously misleading,&#8221; she said.

Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior F.D.A. Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 SILVER SPRING, Md., May 10 &#151; Bowing to safety concerns, government medical advisers urged on Thursday that additional restrictions be put on the use of drugs that treat The recommendations by an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration followed a flurry of studies suggesting that the drugs, meant to help patients cope with , might actually be making their cancer worse or hastening their deaths. The drugs &#151; Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &#38; Johnson &#151; are used by about a half-million American cancer patients a year and have billions of dollars in annual sales. Some members of the committee expressed shock that even though Procrit was first approved 14 years ago, it was still not clear if the drugs were safe at the doses typically used. &#8220;Yes, we have a burning question,&#8221; one panel member, Dr. Silvana Martino, an oncologist in Santa Monica, Calif., said at the meeting here. &#8220;Do these things kill people?&#8221; Most of the studies showing a risk involved use of the drugs at doses higher than doctors typically give them. That left the committee with the question of what to do about use of the drugs at the usual doses until more data become available. The F.D.A. has already clamped down on the drugs. In March it put strict new warnings on the labels, saying the products should be used at the smallest dosage that lets anemic patients avoid blood transfusions. But the panel&#8217;s votes Thursday portend even further restrictions. The committee voted 12 to 5, for instance, that the drugs should be barred from use by patients with certain types of cancer until more is known about their safety. While the committee did not specify which types, several members mentioned , non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. The committee voted 15 to 2 that there should be more restrictions in general if the drugs remain on the market, and 17 to 0 that more studies were needed. And it voted 16 to 1 that anemia therapy should be stopped when chemotherapy is finished. But in one victory for the drug makers, the committee voted 11 to 6 against lowering the ceiling on how much the anemia should be corrected. The labels now say that a patient&#8217;s hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells, should not be raised to more than 12 grams per deciliter of blood. The F.D.A. usually follows the recommendations of such panels. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the agency&#8217;s cancer drug division, said Thursday he could not say yet when or how the agency would act. The two drugs, along with another Amgen drug, Epogen, are also used to treat anemia caused by kidney disease, but yesterday&#8217;s meeting concerned only cancer treatment. Another hearing dealing with kidney disease will be held early in the fall. The panel&#8217;s recommendations were a particular blow to Amgen, which last year took in nearly half its $14.3 billion in revenue from the anemia drugs. Johnson &#38; Johnson is far larger and more diversified than Amgen, and so is less dependent on Procrit sales. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s worse than what investors expected,&#8221; Michael Aberman, an analyst who follows Amgen for Credit Suisse, said after the meeting. Amgen&#8217;s stock fell $5.77, or more than 9 percent, to close at $57.33. Trish Hawkins, an Amgen spokeswoman, said in a statement, &#8220;We will be working with the F.D.A. as they consider the committee&#8217;s recommendations.&#8221; The drugs, known generically as darbepoetin and epoetin, were approved to reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with anemia from chemotherapy. Many doctors and patients believe the drugs fight fatigue and improve patients&#8217; daily lives, although the F.D.A. said it did not find studies with persuasive evidence of such benefits. A panel member from , Dr. Otis Brawley, said some doctors overprescribed the drugs because they made money from doing so. Doctors can sometimes receive more from insurers than they pay for the drugs, especially if they receive rebates from the manufacturers. Dr. Brawley said the drug companies had not done proper studies, and at one point asked them, &#8220;What data do you have to assure me that this is not Miracle-Gro for cancer?&#8221; The staff of the F.D.A. was also critical of the companies, saying they had not provided data they had promised when a similar advisory panel meeting was held in 2004. The companies and their advocates argued that ample data showed the drugs were safe when used properly, except for a long-known risk of increased blood clots. They also argued that the drugs had significant benefits. Forcing cancer patients to go back to transfusions, they said, would expose the patients to risks and inconvenience and further strain the nation&#8217;s already taxed blood supply. That sentiment was also voiced by some committee members. &#8220;I think the idea of going back to the dark ages in regards to supportive care is a step backward,&#8221; said Dr. S. Gail Eckhardt of the , the panel&#8217;s chairman. Advisory panel meetings often feature eloquent pleas from patients that a drug be approved or kept on the market. But there was not a big outpouring of support for the anemia drugs. In fact, some patients expressed dismay at how the drugs were used. &#8220;How is it possible that what was meant to help me might actually have made things worse?&#8221; said Lilla Romeo, who has had breast cancer since 1995.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/health/11anemia.html	F.D.A. Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs - New York Times Mental Health & Behavior F.D.A. Panel Seeks Limits on Cancer Patient Drugs Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 SILVER SPRING, Md., May 10 &#151; Bowing to safety concerns, government medical advisers urged on Thursday that additional restrictions be put on the use of drugs that treat The recommendations by an advisory committee to the Food and Drug Administration followed a flurry of studies suggesting that the drugs, meant to help patients cope with , might actually be making their cancer worse or hastening their deaths. The drugs &#151; Aranesp from Amgen and Procrit from Johnson &#38; Johnson &#151; are used by about a half-million American cancer patients a year and have billions of dollars in annual sales. Some members of the committee expressed shock that even though Procrit was first approved 14 years ago, it was still not clear if the drugs were safe at the doses typically used. &#8220;Yes, we have a burning question,&#8221; one panel member, Dr. Silvana Martino, an oncologist in Santa Monica, Calif., said at the meeting here. &#8220;Do these things kill people?&#8221; Most of the studies showing a risk involved use of the drugs at doses higher than doctors typically give them. That left the committee with the question of what to do about use of the drugs at the usual doses until more data become available. The F.D.A. has already clamped down on the drugs. In March it put strict new warnings on the labels, saying the products should be used at the smallest dosage that lets anemic patients avoid blood transfusions. But the panel&#8217;s votes Thursday portend even further restrictions. The committee voted 12 to 5, for instance, that the drugs should be barred from use by patients with certain types of cancer until more is known about their safety. While the committee did not specify which types, several members mentioned , non-small cell lung cancer and head and neck cancer. The committee voted 15 to 2 that there should be more restrictions in general if the drugs remain on the market, and 17 to 0 that more studies were needed. And it voted 16 to 1 that anemia therapy should be stopped when chemotherapy is finished. But in one victory for the drug makers, the committee voted 11 to 6 against lowering the ceiling on how much the anemia should be corrected. The labels now say that a patient&#8217;s hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells, should not be raised to more than 12 grams per deciliter of blood. The F.D.A. usually follows the recommendations of such panels. Dr. Richard Pazdur, director of the agency&#8217;s cancer drug division, said Thursday he could not say yet when or how the agency would act. The two drugs, along with another Amgen drug, Epogen, are also used to treat anemia caused by kidney disease, but yesterday&#8217;s meeting concerned only cancer treatment. Another hearing dealing with kidney disease will be held early in the fall. The panel&#8217;s recommendations were a particular blow to Amgen, which last year took in nearly half its $14.3 billion in revenue from the anemia drugs. Johnson &#38; Johnson is far larger and more diversified than Amgen, and so is less dependent on Procrit sales. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s worse than what investors expected,&#8221; Michael Aberman, an analyst who follows Amgen for Credit Suisse, said after the meeting. Amgen&#8217;s stock fell $5.77, or more than 9 percent, to close at $57.33. Trish Hawkins, an Amgen spokeswoman, said in a statement, &#8220;We will be working with the F.D.A. as they consider the committee&#8217;s recommendations.&#8221; The drugs, known generically as darbepoetin and epoetin, were approved to reduce the need for blood transfusions in patients with anemia from chemotherapy. Many doctors and patients believe the drugs fight fatigue and improve patients&#8217; daily lives, although the F.D.A. said it did not find studies with persuasive evidence of such benefits. A panel member from , Dr. Otis Brawley, said some doctors overprescribed the drugs because they made money from doing so. Doctors can sometimes receive more from insurers than they pay for the drugs, especially if they receive rebates from the manufacturers. Dr. Brawley said the drug companies had not done proper studies, and at one point asked them, &#8220;What data do you have to assure me that this is not Miracle-Gro for cancer?&#8221; The staff of the F.D.A. was also critical of the companies, saying they had not provided data they had promised when a similar advisory panel meeting was held in 2004. The companies and their advocates argued that ample data showed the drugs were safe when used properly, except for a long-known risk of increased blood clots. They also argued that the drugs had significant benefits. Forcing cancer patients to go back to transfusions, they said, would expose the patients to risks and inconvenience and further strain the nation&#8217;s already taxed blood supply. That sentiment was also voiced by some committee members. &#8220;I think the idea of going back to the dark ages in regards to supportive care is a step backward,&#8221; said Dr. S. Gail Eckhardt of the , the panel&#8217;s chairman. Advisory panel meetings often feature eloquent pleas from patients that a drug be approved or kept on the market. But there was not a big outpouring of support for the anemia drugs. In fact, some patients expressed dismay at how the drugs were used. &#8220;How is it possible that what was meant to help me might actually have made things worse?&#8221; said Lilla Romeo, who has had breast cancer since 1995.

http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/11/washington/11fda.html	Passage of Drug Safety Bill Was Common Goal for Two Very Different Senators - New York Times Passage of Drug Safety Bill Was Common Goal for Two Very Different Senators Sign In to E-Mail or Save This Published: May 11, 2007 WASHINGTON, May 10 &#151; Legislation to beef up drug safety, passed by the Senate this week with only one dissenting vote, grew out of an extraordinary pact between two senators and a frantic effort by the pharmaceutical industry to avoid any disruption in the approval of new drugs. The bill would increase the fees paid by drug makers to help finance the work of the Food and Drug Administration and would give the agency new power to police company conduct. Industry lobbyists and executives said they supported the bill for one overriding reason: pink slips. Sometime this summer, if a bill has not passed, medical officers at the F.D.A. will start getting notices that they are in danger of being laid off by the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Some of those officers are likely to be in the midst of reviewing new drug applications crucial to the future of drug makers. If those medical officers leave, drug approvals may be delayed &#151; a terrifying prospect for many companies. &#8220;The last thing we want is for F.D.A. employees to start thinking they may not have a job and start leaving,&#8221; said Alan R. Goldhammer, deputy vice president of Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a trade group for brand-name drug companies. In addition, many in the drug industry said they supported the bill because they believed that it would help restore public confidence in the nation&#8217;s drug supply. &#8220;There has been a loss of confidence in the F.D.A., and we can&#8217;t afford to have that,&#8221; said Dr. Joseph M. Feczko, Pfizer&#8217;s chief medical officer. &#8220;When our medicines come out, we want people to understand they have gone through a rigorous review process.&#8221; Under the bill, the F.D.A. could impose civil fines on companies that violated a drug safety plan or ran false or misleading advertisements. But major drug makers said they would comply with federal requirements, so the agency would not have reason to impose penalties on them. , Democrat of Massachusetts, was chief sponsor of the legislation, but Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, was equally responsible for its contents. In an unusual display of bipartisanship, they worked together to fend off amendments that would have made the bill unacceptable to the White House, raised the ire of the pharmaceutical industry or jeopardized chances for passage. &#8220;Kennedy and I have developed a trust,&#8221; Mr. Enzi said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t try to run over each other. We have a history of passing bills &#151; 27 signed by the president in the last two years.&#8221; An earlier version of the legislation was introduced by Mr. Enzi last August, when controlled Congress and he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. When Democrats took control this year and Mr. Kennedy became chairman of the committee, he kept his compact with Mr. Enzi. Working together, they steered the legislation through the committee and the full Senate. Along the way, they accepted dozens of changes proposed by lawmakers of both parties. Mr. Enzi, an accountant and former owner of a shoe store, was mayor of Gillette, Wyo., and served 10 years in the State Legislature. His quiet manner could hardly differ more from that of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Enzi is as conservative as Mr. Kennedy is liberal. But both are pragmatic legislative craftsmen. Mr. Enzi was recruited into politics by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, another Wyoming Republican who collaborated with Mr. Kennedy on many issues, including In an interview, Mr. Simpson said: &#8220;Mike is a legislator. He&#8217;s calm. He&#8217;s steady. He&#8217;s not a partisan kook or anything of that nature.&#8221; Mr. Simpson said Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy had &#8220;a mutual admiration society, built on trust, respect and friendship, with none of the savage partisanship&#8221; found elsewhere in American politics. Mr. Enzi holds the Senate seat once held by Mr. Simpson and his father, Milward L. Simpson, who entered the Senate on the same day as Mr. Kennedy, Nov. 7, 1962. &#8220;Teddy loved my dad,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, who nurtured the relationship between Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy. , Republican of New Hampshire, voted against the drug safety bill in the committee, but worked with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi to make changes that won his support for the legislation on the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a Ted Kennedy who is quite flamboyant and partisan in the theater of the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Gregg said in an interview. &#8220;And there is a Ted Kennedy who is extremely bipartisan and willing to work with people in the back rooms of the Senate.&#8221; Industry officials breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, that would effectively maintain the current ban on imported drugs. Drug makers fiercely oppose efforts to legalize imports of lower-cost medicines from Canada and other countries. Having won that fight, drug company executives said, they decided not to fight other provisions that they saw as less threatening. &#8220;They need to pick their battles,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. &#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t interfere with pricing and approvals is not going to hurt them seriously.&#8221; Still, many advocates, including some who support the bill&#8217;s passage, said the legislation was not the answer to the nation&#8217;s drug safety problems. &#8220;We have horrible leadership at the F.D.A., and they don&#8217;t even use the authorities they already have,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.

Feczko, Pfizer&#8217;s chief medical officer. &#8220;When our medicines come out, we want people to understand they have gone through a rigorous review process.&#8221; Under the bill, the F.D.A. could impose civil fines on companies that violated a drug safety plan or ran false or misleading advertisements. But major drug makers said they would comply with federal requirements, so the agency would not have reason to impose penalties on them. , Democrat of Massachusetts, was chief sponsor of the legislation, but Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming, was equally responsible for its contents. In an unusual display of bipartisanship, they worked together to fend off amendments that would have made the bill unacceptable to the White House, raised the ire of the pharmaceutical industry or jeopardized chances for passage. &#8220;Kennedy and I have developed a trust,&#8221; Mr. Enzi said in an interview. &#8220;We don&#8217;t try to run over each other. We have a history of passing bills &#151; 27 signed by the president in the last two years.&#8221; An earlier version of the legislation was introduced by Mr. Enzi last August, when controlled Congress and he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. When Democrats took control this year and Mr. Kennedy became chairman of the committee, he kept his compact with Mr. Enzi. Working together, they steered the legislation through the committee and the full Senate. Along the way, they accepted dozens of changes proposed by lawmakers of both parties. Mr. Enzi, an accountant and former owner of a shoe store, was mayor of Gillette, Wyo., and served 10 years in the State Legislature. His quiet manner could hardly differ more from that of Mr. Kennedy. Mr. Enzi is as conservative as Mr. Kennedy is liberal. But both are pragmatic legislative craftsmen. Mr. Enzi was recruited into politics by former Senator Alan K. Simpson, another Wyoming Republican who collaborated with Mr. Kennedy on many issues, including In an interview, Mr. Simpson said: &#8220;Mike is a legislator. He&#8217;s calm. He&#8217;s steady. He&#8217;s not a partisan kook or anything of that nature.&#8221; Mr. Simpson said Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy had &#8220;a mutual admiration society, built on trust, respect and friendship, with none of the savage partisanship&#8221; found elsewhere in American politics. Mr. Enzi holds the Senate seat once held by Mr. Simpson and his father, Milward L. Simpson, who entered the Senate on the same day as Mr. Kennedy, Nov. 7, 1962. &#8220;Teddy loved my dad,&#8221; said Mr. Simpson, who nurtured the relationship between Mr. Enzi and Mr. Kennedy. , Republican of New Hampshire, voted against the drug safety bill in the committee, but worked with Mr. Kennedy and Mr. Enzi to make changes that won his support for the legislation on the floor. &#8220;There&#8217;s a Ted Kennedy who is quite flamboyant and partisan in the theater of the Senate,&#8221; Mr. Gregg said in an interview. &#8220;And there is a Ted Kennedy who is extremely bipartisan and willing to work with people in the back rooms of the Senate.&#8221; Industry officials breathed a huge sigh of relief when the Senate approved an amendment offered by Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi, that would effectively maintain the current ban on imported drugs. Drug makers fiercely oppose efforts to legalize imports of lower-cost medicines from Canada and other countries. Having won that fight, drug company executives said, they decided not to fight other provisions that they saw as less threatening. &#8220;They need to pick their battles,&#8221; said Barbara Ryan, a pharmaceutical industry analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. &#8220;Anything that doesn&#8217;t interfere with pricing and approvals is not going to hurt them seriously.&#8221; Still, many advocates, including some who support the bill&#8217;s passage, said the legislation was not the answer to the nation&#8217;s drug safety problems. &#8220;We have horrible leadership at the F.D.A., and they don&#8217;t even use the authorities they already have,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.
