It is used as follows: A content:item describes a single version of the content for its parent item. If the content is available on the Web at a specific address, content:item has an rdf:about attribute containg the URI of the content. A content:item can include the following sub-elements: An empty element with an rdf:resource attribute that points to a URI representing the format of the content:item. Suggested best practice is to use the list of RDDL natures Required if no URI is defined for the content:item. Includes the content of the content:item. This is encoded as specified by content:encoding. If the content is included as unencoded XML, then the attribute rdf:parseType="Literal" should be used as to not confuse RDF parsers. An empty element with an rdf:resource attribute that points to a URI representing the encoding of the content:item. An encoding is a reversable method of including content within the RSS file. If no encoding is specified, it should be assumed that the content is included as character data, like so: If the document is encoded as well-formed XML, the URI should be used.

Note that for quite a while this page has had a typo and erroneously referred to this element as 'commentRSS' as opposed to the correct 'commentRss'. Feed consumers should be aware that they may run into both spellings in the wild. Please see This is great! I&#8217;ve been waiting for something to stick. Looks like people are going to use the commentRSS element.

LL claims that 60 people were banned "in connection with the recent grid attacks," but many of them had not even logged in for months. As far as anyone can tell, LL simply banned everyone that didn't have the lowest role in the group. Many enemies of W-Hat were banned, but most of them did not deserve it. Only innocent people were hurt by this action. The true griefers were back in the game within minutes, while some of the most talented people in SL lost years of work with no warning and no explanation. Those people, their fans, and their friends are the only ones who will suffer. Though W-Hat was not affected, people generally name W-Hat instead of Voted 5 when referring to the event."

http://blog.holtz.com/index.php/weblog/comments/eric_rice_explains_it_all_for_you_chris_and_owen/	a shel of my former self: Comments You've found the blog of Shel Holtz, ABC, VP of New Marketing for . I've been in corporate communications since the mid-1970s, online since the mid 1980s and on the Net since 1990. I wrote "Public Relations on the Net," among other books, manuals and articles. I am available for speaking and training engagements. &sect; Search This Site &sect; Dealing with Spam In an effort to thrwart comment spammers, I'm using a utility that ensures a real person is entering a comment. I apologize for the extra step required to enter the word you see in the graphic, but it's better than cleaning out a few hundred poker ads. Eric Rice explains it all for you (Chris and Owen) of the new &#8220;Second Life Podcast&#8221; features an interview with new-media wizard that makes it easy to understand why is worth paying attention to. In Rice&#8217;s view, it&#8217;s not about a &#8220;second&#8221; life at all, but just an extension of this one, along the same lines as instant messaging. Chris Clarke and Owen Lystrup in particular ought to give this a serious listen. Meanwhile, Eric Kintz, VP of global marketing strategy and excellence for Hewlett Packard, has produced an excellent post on the need for marketers to understand the notion of &#8221; .&#8221; Avatars in Second Life-like environments (which Kintz appropriately identifies as a social network) are just part of the picture: In medical terms, âdissociative identityâ refers to the existence in an individual of two or more distinct identities, each with its own pattern of perceiving and interacting with the environment. âDissociative identity marketingâ would refer to the relationship a brand establishes with the various personas of a consumer, from the blogging persona, to the social network persona or the gaming persona. is recognizing Second Life as an opportunity for communicators (subscription required). More solid thinking about why communicators need to stop making excuses or simply dismissing these new environments where people and brands are interacting. If we can&#8217;t provide counsel on communicating with our audiences when they happen to be in these environments, somebody else will, and we will become that much less relevant to our employers and clients. Posted by on 09/11 at 12:48 PM of the new "Second Life Podcast" features an interview with new&#45;media wizard that makes it easy to understand why is worth paying attention to. In Rice&apos;s view, it&apos;s not about a "second" life at all, but just an extension of this one, along the same lines as instant messaging. Chris Clarke and Owen Lystrup in&#8230;" dc:creator="Shel" dc:date="2006-09-11 08:48:00 PM GMT" /> I had a listen. Nothing I haven&#8217;t heard before, Shel. I will say that the interviewer needs to brush up on his skills, though. &#8220;Um..... so......&#8221; at least three times before most of his questions. on 09/13 at 11:44 AM Yep, the interviewer/podcaster is new to all this, but I thought Eric was very articulate despite that. on 09/14 at 01:41 AM It&#8217;s never been the value, just the nature of the place. It&#8217;s like porn. I see the value. It&#8217;s largely lucrative for many people...I just opt to stay away. on 09/14 at 05:41 PM Sorry to say it, Owen, but you sound very much like the naysayers I encountered who dismissed the World Wide Web back in 1995 and 1996&#8212;with much the same rationale. Again, I don&#8217;t find SL particularly invigorating personally. I just find that, as a communicator and given mounting evidence, I would be foolish to ignore it. on 09/15 at 03:32 AM As I&#8217;m starting to say more and more, and pardon the arrogance of the statement--I have no problem if folks want to write it off--- more for the rest of us. After seeing how many PR folks showed up at the event yesterday in SL, I&#8217;m curious if naysayers worry that their peers will be more than happy to take away revenue streams. on 09/15 at 05:51 AM I&#8217;m going to say this again. I think it&#8217;s the fourth time now. You keep making the same point, as do I. I&#8217;ve never said I&#8217;ll ignore it. I recognize it for what it is. I understand there&#8217;s potential there. It&#8217;s just not for me. It&#8217;s too early. on 09/15 at 04:21 PM My apologies, Owen, if I gave you the impression that I didn&#8217;t understand your point the FIRST time! I did. My retorts are aimed at other readers, not you, since I believe they should not follow your example! As I said, I heard people 10 years ago say, &#8220;The Web is not for me, it&#8217;s too early.&#8221; I have no problem if that&#8217;s the aproach you want to take to SL (as Eric says, there are plenty of PR practitioners who will be happy to take work you don&#8217;t want), but I think others would be ill-advised to emulate it. It&#8217;s a point I&#8217;ll continue to make. on 09/16 at 09:30 AM I agree with the premise that it should be monitored. I just don&#8217;t happen to think it&#8217;ll make the cut. I have a hard time seeing how anyone could monetize Second Life in a business communications context. It&#8217;s too weird to play in and with...but we&#8217;ll see how it plays out. on 09/18 at 02:23 PM Remember my personal information Notify me of follow-up comments?

http://intopr.prblogs.org	Into PR | Owen Lystrup&#8217;s foray into a PR career and comments on the industry Weekly Grammaticalness: Analogy, Allegory, Metaphor and Simile Once again I&#8217;ll be piggybacking on I find it important, because we all use analogies, metaphors and similes every day. Most of them are small, and we likely don&#8217;t even think about them when we use them. However, they can be a very useful tool when trying to explain something to a reader, client or customer. Copyblogger does an excellent job of explaining the differences between analogies, metaphors and similes. Check out the A similar device Copyblogger left out was the allegory. Allegorical tales are less popular and not used very often. However, they are used in comedy quite frequently. is a one-to-one comparison or substitution of something figuritve for something literal. While this is extremely similar to a metaphor, allegories are usually more subtle and a lot more involved, taking up entire books and pieces of art. Perhaps the most famous allegorical tales are in literature, Sir Walter Raleigh&#8217;s are two famous examples I can think of. RSS Your Apartment Search As a tip for the day, look for other ways to use RSS other than receiving news. In this case, an apartment search. Searching for apartments is such a pain in my ass. Especially when it&#8217;s a place like San Francisco, which doesn&#8217;t obey the born in San Francisco , so everyone there uses it. It&#8217;s a helpful sight, easy to navigate, produces good results. But for someone new to The City, it can be a little daunting. I don&#8217;t know any of the neighborhoods, and I certainly don&#8217;t like the prices I&#8217;m seeing. Luckily the site has a &#8220;room/roommate&#8221; search to find people looking for roommates. Usually results through these searches are much better than searching for actual apartments. Since San Francisco is awesome, you won&#8217;t usually find a decent place in a decent neighborhood for any less than $1200 (that&#8217;s about 600 pounds sterling for those of you across the Atlantic). In my searches I&#8217;ve been checking more and more frequently to see what&#8217;s new. But I find I&#8217;ve been looking at so many apartments in so many locations, I don&#8217;t remember what I&#8217;ve already seen. This is where the lovely gift of RSS comes in. Craigslist (as I&#8217;m sure other apartment searching tools as well) allows users to subscribe to searches through RSS. This way, apartments are coming to me, and I can be more efficient about searching. Note to self about city living: Some people do without kitchens. Lewis PR Is Hiring For those of you looking for jobs, Lewis PR is still hiring. I&#8217;m good, but I can only be in one place at a time. If you&#8217;re at the account executive level or higher with tech experience and are looking to move to San Francisco or Boston, contact Wendy Brittain in HR. I&#8217;d also be happy to answer any questions I can. Job descriptions can be found at IntoPR Joins Lewis PR Things have been silent around here lately. I&#8217;ve been crazy busy with end-of-school business. Lots of things to wrap up. Like finding a job. So after much deliberation, and an incredibly lengthy interview process, I&#8217;ve decided to join Lewis PR&#8217;s office in San Francisco. I&#8217;m very much excited. Lewis is a terrific company experiencing a great amount of growth. With growth comes opportunity. It&#8217;s also a young bunch, which is a good thing to me. So after all my name incorrectly, I&#8217;ll be working with the company that holds Second Life as one its largest clients. Thanks are in order. First one goes to , for forwarding my resume and being such a great help along the way. The second goes to for being a great vice president and for doing his best to convince me to take the position. Big thank you&#8217;s to Arin Johnson and Wendy Brittain, the HR team at Lewis, for working with me. who did his best to steal me away from Lewis and get me over on the Fleishman-Hillard side. Also, thank you so much to everyone who provided me with advice and counsel and offers for help in the last few months. Here&#8217;s a short list, and if I missed you I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t forget about you; trust me. (nice to finally &#8220;meet you,&#8221; BTW) , (and for your hard work keeping the blog server going. I wouldn&#8217;t have been able to make all these connections without it), , James Barbour (though he no longer has a blog), , and everyone else I may have missed. Now the question of what to do with this blog. There are so many PR blogs out there and all of them have quite a bit to say, but also quite a bit of the same stuff to say at the same time. Does the world really need another? My intention from the beginning was to use this blog to get a job and quit it once I had one. So here I am. It&#8217;s been a journey. I&#8217;ve communicated with so many wonderful people over the past year (almost). I&#8217;ve learned a great deal. I&#8217;ve written quite a bit and gotten some great responses. But still, I don&#8217;t know how much value there is in me having a blog. So it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll have to consider and wonder about in the coming weeks. For now, I&#8217;ll keep writing. Jott: For Those of You With Absolutely No Time It&#8217;s basically a free way of sending yourself a note from your cell phone. If you have a cell phone that sends e-mail, no problem. For those of us not quite as fancy, can help you out. Record a message from your cell phone through a toll-free number, Jott will type it up and e-mail it to you. Simple enough.  The best part of it is that it&#8217;s free. For now. The Problem with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles I&#8217;ve always been a huge fan of . It came out when I was in the second grade, and I thought it was the coolest thing since sliced bread. Or pizza. I remember seeing a commercial countdown for it on TV and never missing a single episode once it aired. Back in the &#8217;90s, guy-valley talk was cool. It was funny. It was careless. . That&#8217;s why this movie probably will not have near the success of its predecessors. It&#8217;s dialog and plot line are both outdated. No one says &#8220;dude&#8221; or &#8220;bro&#8221; in the valley voice anymore. That being the case, it comes off as someone trying to be hip and cool when really he has no idea what&#8217;s in style anymore. Like a middle-aged uncle just now hearing about and bragging to his younger nephew about it. Because here&#8217;s the thing: TMNT is old. But it&#8217;s not yet vintage. I feel like the would have more success with a remake of than TMNT. Give TMNT another five to 10 years and let it rest for a while. for just the opposite reasons. It&#8217;s vintage reborn, which is something Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Create an Online Portfolio For all you students: create an online portfolio. If you&#8217;re here, and you&#8217;re reading this, chances are you already have one or are in the process of making one, which is great. If you don&#8217;t have one, get one. If you don&#8217;t know how to make one, here&#8217;s some more great advice: take your print portfolio and put it on a disc. I interviewed with a over the weekend and got some excellent advice from the wonderful person I interviewed with. I admiringly pet my leather portfolio folder and regaled with the tale of how expensive it was to purchase, then asked her how important it was that I have it. The short of it? Very. People want to see the quality of your writing and the previous experience you&#8217;ve had. However, not everyone is going to get to read very much during an interview, so you&#8217;re going to need to leave them with more. The great thing about a CD is you can organize your files, leave a note for them to read thanking them for the interview and you can include different/bigger files you wouldn&#8217;t be able to include in a normal portfolio. So thank you for the advice. I&#8217;ll be including CDs in my expensive portfolio folder next time. My Job Is Better Than Yours Usually people complain about crappy college jobs. I know I&#8217;ve certainly had my fair share. I&#8217;ve worked at a feed store, where I injured my hand severely with a bale hook on my first day. I worked at a cabinet shop and had to get six stitches in my shin from dropping a maple drawer on my leg. I&#8217;ve worked at Michael&#8217;s as a framer, Wal-Mart as a bike builder, Mervyn&#8217;s as a nobody and a few other equally unimportant jobs. , however, has been nothing short of rewarding. So I feel proud in promoting how well the traffic is doing . It&#8217;s building a great base of regular readers, and for those of you who don&#8217;t regularly visit: you should be. And you should be leaving comments. That&#8217;s what makes it more than a feed site by being a community. So check it out. It&#8217;ll keep you informed about all things marketing, PR, business communication, advertising, even celebrity. Create an account. Put up a funny picture of yourself. Submit some awesome links with a funny headline. Engage in a few comments. It&#8217;s fun. I promise. Spreading San Fran Love To be fair, I love San Francisco. Obviously from previous posts it appears as though San Francisco isn&#8217;t my first choice, but it has nothing to do with the city or the people or the companies there. So if you&#8217;re in HR and you&#8217;re reading this, I love your company. No worries. I applied for a reason. The reasons I am being much more selective in whom I apply to in San Francisco are twofold: - And this is the large number one. San Francisco has wonderful weather, diversity, art, nightlife and a number of other wonderful qualities that makes it a great city, not even to mention the beach. These reasons are also why there are so many people and so few places to live there. Obviously I can&#8217;t take an internship at $12 an hour, pay off student loans with $950 monthly rent with three roommates and expect to not end up in a financial hole. - This reason is actually very minor. I know many people who have never lived outside California and have loved every day of their life. However, I was looking for an opportunity to live in another region of the country just for the experience. Of course, there is absolutely no reason why this can&#8217;t come later down the line when I have a bit more experience and more open doors. Staying in the most beautiful state in the country in one of its greatest cities is by no means a bad thing. So don&#8217;t fret San Francisco companies. If you&#8217;re reading this and I&#8217;ve submitted an application and CV, it&#8217;s because I like your company and I love San Francisco. NBC Needs to Listen to Office Fans Seriously, what&#8217;s the point of having a comments section if you&#8217;re not going to read at least one of them? . Big fan. It&#8217;s probably the best show on TV, behind How I Met Your Mother of course. You can&#8217;t get better than and his broings-on about town. So since I usually can&#8217;t watch The Office on Thursdays, I watch the two-minute recaps on NBC&#8217;s Web site. Take a look at and read the comments below. The fans are for full episodes to be shown online. It&#8217;s good for the Web site; it&#8217;s good for the advertisers; and it&#8217;s good for the efforts in stopping YouTube piracy. For whatever reason, NBC isn&#8217;t listening. I am a huge fan of How I Met Your Mother. Love it. Can&#8217;t wait to see the newest episode. But I don&#8217;t have TV. I&#8217;m also a huge fan of . Love it. Can&#8217;t wait to see the newest episode. But I don&#8217;t have TV.

Young Sarah (Jennifer Connelly) is left home alone by her parents and she has to babysit her little brother Toby. But the baby keeps crying and Sarah, while telling him a story to make him sleep, inadvertently conjures from a fantasy world the Goblin King (David Bowie) who steals the child and brings him to his castle in the middle of a labyrinth.

She is about to discover that the time has come to leave her childhood behind. In real life she has to baby-sit her brother and contend with parents who don't understand her at all. Her petulance leads her to call the goblins to take the baby away, but when they actually do, she realizes her responsibility to rescue him. Sarah negotiates the Labyrinth to reach the City of the Goblins and the castle of their king. The king is the only other human in the film and is played by a glam-rocking David Bowie, who performs five of his songs. The rest of the cast are puppets, a wonderful array of Jim Henson's imaginative masterpieces. Henson gives credit to children's author and illustrator Maurice Sendak, and the creatures in the movie will remind Sendak fans of his drawings. The castle of the king is a living M.C. Escher set that adults will enjoy. The film combines the highest standards of art, costume, and set decoration. Like executive producer George Lucas's other fantasies, mixes adventure with lessons about growing up. Journey into the fantastical world of LABYRINTH, starring David Bowie, and Jennifer Connelly in one of her first lead roles, and a cast of incredible creatures created by Jim Henson and produced by the Master of Myth, George Lucas! The classic fantasy adventure film available in an all-new Collector&#146;s Edition. DVD will be re-mastered to add new bonus materials.

It's a wonderful tale, with marvellous tunes that linger on and on. From "It's Only Forever", "Underground" and "Chilly Down" but most especially "As the World Falls Down". Sigh, such a beautiful and deftly filmed Cinderella Ball for Adults. I don't know a woman that loves this film who does not say "I want that dress!". Sarah is an easy to relate to teen. She is part child - part woman, one foot in each world and truly not belonging to either. Added to this, her father has remarried and has little time to spend on his growing daughter. We are not told, but it's clear her mother is dead. Mom was an actress and lover of the magic and she passed this on to her lovely daughter. It's very hard to believe Jennifer Connelly is only 12 years old here!!! She is the perfect Sarah, the beautiful woman-child that has no sense of her place in the world. Too grown for childish things, too young for boys and dating. Her cherished childhood toys are giving carelessly to her new baby stepbrother, again emphasizing her feelings of alienation. Her new mother has little patience, and even when she tries, she meets with a hostile resentful woman-child. Sarah pain at feeling as if she is not wanted anywhere is so heartbreaking. Left with the crying baby, and feeling that her world is slowly crumbling around her (reflected in Bowie's "As the World Falls Down"), the child side takes control and spitefully wishes the baby to be taken away from the Goblins. In true Muppet fashion, they promptly and cheerful comply. Sarah faces the Goblin King Jareth - perfectly brought to life by Bowie - and demands he return her brother. When Jareth says he will only return her brother if she finds her way to the Goblin City, Sarah sucks in her courage and goes after him. Along the way she meets wonderful friends such as Hoggle and Sir Didymous, and finds out her own inner value and worth. Something we all have to do in growing up. A true faerytale for the little girl in us, wonderfully realized through the magic of the Muppets, Connelly and Bowie. This set is laced with all the wonderful goodies that will thrill all the many lovers of the film. Kudos for the super repackage. | Was this review helpful to you? 29 of 33 people found the following review helpful: Fantasy come to life , August 12, 2004 (Earth, or somewhere nearby) - See all my reviews I almost gave this movie four stars, until I realized how many times I've come back to it. It really is worth watching again and again. The story's opening should appeal to many kids: teenaged Sara rebels at the baby-sitting duties that interfere with her vivid fantasy life. She would never hurt the child, but creates a fairy tale around her frustration. In this story, the beautiful princess (Sara, of course) is set free when denizens of Fairy-land abduct the evil infant. Then, suddenly, the fairy tale becomes real. The story is Sara's quest to recover the lost child from Jared, played by David Bowie. He works well as the world's dark lord, even if his song scenes seemed gratuitous. Sara traverses the mythic Labyrinth guided, misguided, and befriended by beings from Jim Henson's wonderful imagination. This is the true magic of "Labyrinth," the sustained vision, comical and fantastical, of Brian Froud's world peopled by Henson's creatures. The whole world is simply amazing - and it goes on, in changing scenes and amazing detail, for the rest of the movie. This is a wonderful kids' movie, with no real violence or adult themes, and with a happy ending. It does have a dark edge, however, that may scare the very youngest. Although it's a kids' movie, the kids are optional. Feel free to enjoy it just for yourself. | Was this review helpful to you?

It was amazing the way it was planed to be. The late Jim Henson would be proud of an achievement that he thought that could not be done, it was and always be there as a movie that all would watch again and over again 1,00 times. The talent of the puppeteers, Bowie and Miss Connelly made it memorable because of Jim Henson's awesome conceptual design and story line. I saw it on television in 1990 because I was born in 1986 ( the year it made it to the show house. I bought the movie in March of 2005 and watched it once per day since then. My sister loved this movie as well. My dad thought I was a geek for loving the movie, oh well, we have our own hobbies.

Recalling the worlds of J.R.R. Tolkien, Henson tells the story of a race of grotesque birdlike lizards called the Skeksis, gnomish dragons who rule their fantastic planet with an iron claw. A prophecy tells of a Gelfling (a small elfin being) who will topple their empire, so in their reign of terror they have exterminated the race, or so they think. The orphan Jen, raised in solitude by a race of peace-loving wizards called the Mystics, embarks on a quest to find the missing shard of the Dark Crystal (which gives the Skeksis their power) and restore the balance of the universe. Henson and codirector Frank Oz have pushed puppetry into a new direction: traditional puppets, marionettes, giant bodysuits, and mechanical constructions are mixed seamlessly in a fantasy world of towering castles, simple huts, dank caves, a giant clockwork observatory, and a magnificent landscape that seem to have leaped off the pages of a storybook. Muppet fans will recognize many of the voice actors--a few characters sound awfully close to familiar comic creations--but otherwise it's a completely alien world made familiar by a mythic quest that resonates through stories over the ages.

However, I'm disappointed in the "features". Pretty much everything on the disc is the same as what's on the non-collector's edition. The few new things to me aren't worth it. Character Illustrations and storyboards are nice and all. I was excited about "The Mithra Treatment", which I thought was the original print of the movie...where the characters speak their own language and not English (you see some of this in the deleted scenes on the disc). It is not. It is simply screens and screens of Henson's original notes. Interesting yes... but I'd rather have that in a booklet, not in screens on my TV. Then again, the fact that it was only 1 disc should have tipped me off. The packaging is nice, the replica of Henson's notepad detailing the original ideas which would become the movie is very interesting... but in my opinion, not worth the $35 or whatever I just shelled out for this. I'm very disappointed in the amount of "exclusives" on this DVD. The original print of the film would have been *amazing* to see, to see how Henson and Co. originally viewed the film. Maybe some new interviews with some of the other players (Oz and Froud for sure) as they look back on the movie, its box office disappointment but almost cult success. Or even a nifty booklet with a lot of these extras in it. I hate sitting in front of my TV trying to read screens of information or look at drawings which I'd rather have on paper so I can see the detail better. So to make a long story short... if you like the movie, get the regular edition and not collector's. If you're a fanatic like me, bought the re-issued World of the Dark Crystal book and even considered shelling out a few hundred for the original pressing... and somehow MISSED buying the first DVD release of this movie, well then this is probably for you. But if you already own the DVD that came out a few years ago... I'd think very heavily on it, unless you are a fanatic. Even as a fanatic, you probably won't find any new material here (especially if you own the aforementioned book), and I'd save the $35. Or try to recoup some of your "loss" and sell your other DVD somewhere (like I'm going to try and do). I hope that if Henson and Co. decide to do a Collector's Edition of Labyrinth they put a little more work into it. I have to say, I'm disappointed with how the kids have carried on Jim's legend. | Was this review helpful to you? 31 of 41 people found the following review helpful: Great fantasy, great puppetry! , September 7, 2000 (Marseilles, Illinois, USA) - See all my reviews Jen is the last of the elf-like Gelflings. After the Garthim, servants of the evil Skeksis, slaughtered his people he was taken in and raised by the gentle Mystics. When his teacher dies, Jen set out into the world to fulfill a prophecy that a Gelfling will heal the Dark Crystal, and bring an end to the reign of the Skeksis. Jen's world is turned upside-down when he meets Kira, who also considered herself the last Gelfling, and discovers love. This movie was created by the incomparable Jim Henson, and includes some of the finest puppetry ever produced. The scenes are dramatic, and the action intense. This is one of the finest fantasy movies ever produced. As a bonus, the VHS includes a fifteen-minute documentary on the making of the movie. My children, ages 7 and 9, found the movie too frightening, but were greatly enlightened by the "making of" documentary at the end, that took the fright out of the Skeksis. This movie is rated PG, and is probably not a good movie for younger viewers. That said, though, this is a great movie and a thrilling fantasy! | Was this review helpful to you?

The film was digitally remastered both audio and Anamorphic video but picture quality was not restored. What a pity! I guess there will be an Ultimate Edition coming, some time in the future. The reason for saying this is, Orphanage Animation Studios is producing the sequel and the title is Power of the Dark Crystal which is scheduled to release in spring 2008. I am sure they will do something with picture quality of the current release of Dark Crystal DVD Editions as well as enhancing the CGIs and other special effects in the movie. So for those who want to buy or add this movie into his or her DVD library, I suggest that you wait till the sequel release next year. You might get better picture and technical quality, or perhaps other extra features, if/when they re-release the film in the DVD market. | Was this review helpful to you? 0 of 1 people found the following review helpful: One of a kind fantasy , April 17, 2007 Emmit W. Stewart "movie fan" (Canton, OH USA) - See all my reviews This movie stands alone. There had been other puppet movies before, Notably those of Bill Baird. But Jim Henson went as far beyond Bill Baird as Werner Von Braun had gone beyond Leonardo Da Vinci. The movie is basically a children's story, but like some of Tolkien's work, to which it could be compared, it has depths that make it enjoyable to adults as well. A real gem for the whole family. The "making Of" featurette is well worth watching for any fan of fantasy films and should be "must view" for any one wanting to produce or direct anything in that genre. | Was this review helpful to you? 0 of 1 people found the following review helpful: A work of art! , April 14, 2007 K.

If you have suggestions, ideas, needs, please discuss them or on the associated This format, when finalized, will be upward-compatible with , meaning that a 0.92 or 0.91 source will also be a valid 0.93 source. I expect a 60-day discussion period at which time, I will use my best judgement to decide which features are in. Without someone taking responsibility, there is never movement. We've learned this well in previous iterations of RSS. Forking is OK, but please use a different name. Thanks. I'll take notes here, let's work together, keep RSS simple, but add features that people need to express the content that flows through RSS. The 0.93 spec allows multiple . 0.92 allowed only a single enclosure.

http://interglacial.com/rss/about.html	RSS stands for Rich Site Summary (or Really Simple Syndication, take your pick). In a nutshell, RSS is a new way for people who publish content online to notify people interested in that content whenever fresh content is made available online. There's two ways of looking at RSS: from a user's perspective, and from a technical/publisher's perspective. RSS from a User's Perspective As I meander around the web, I see all sorts of interesting sites, and I bookmark them - and I never look at them again, because my bookmarks are mostly things I just might need to refer to later, and all these things drown out the interesting sites that I really mean to visit routinely. So basically I end up having just a mental bookmark list of URLs that I just type in when I have some time to kill. Theonion.com, booktv.org, use.perl.org, bookslut.com, but not many others, because I just don't remember things well. And even if I did, most of the time there's not much new content at any particular site, and I have to weed thru all the old stuff to find the new stuff. But with RSS, besides bookmarking a site, I also see its little RSS button (altho it may be labelled "XML" or "Syndicate"), and copy the URL of the RSS feed that it points to. I save that URL in my RSS reader (which is effectively built into my browser -- altho it may be implemented is a or as an applet or plugin that runs in my browser and saves data locally, and occasionally may actually be a separate program). From then on, when I have some time to kill and want to see something interesting, I just run my RSS reader, and it starts up and reads a dozen feeds (since they're all such small files, it happens quickly). It then shows me a list of what's new and where. But this works only if there's for sites I'm interested in. Sites without RSS feeds just fall out of my gnat-like attention span. Sites with RSS feeds draw me back many many times. RSS from a Content-Provider's Perspective , by Amy Gahran] From a technical perspective, an RSS feed is a small data file (typically under 10KB) that a site (or subsection of a site, whatever) makes available, which lists the most recent items at that site. The file is in a simple dialect of XML; the file is meant to be autogenerated from the rest of the site -- say, from the site's content-management system, or by having that just reads part of an HTML page (like the site's main page) and summarizes it in RSS. By notifying people interested in your content, as well as Web sites that collect and package content announcements (called ), you are "feeding" them your content &#150; hence the term Why RSS is Better Than E-mail Announcements Just about everyone who publishes content online has some sort of e-mail announcement list. I do, too. Still, RSS is a great complement to e-mail announcements because it doesn't clutter people's in-boxes, it's easier to manage for recipients who get a lot of news online, it's spam-proof, and it's easier to manage than an e-mail list. While not a lot of people know about RSS right now, it's getting popular quickly. I wouldn't be surprised if in the next couple of years RSS becomes as widely known and used as the Web and e-mail. You Need a Feed Reader In order to make use of RSS feeds, you can install special (also called a "news reader") to display RSS feeds in a format that the average human can read, understand, and use. It's just like how Web browsers interpret and display HTML and other types of code and files. My favorite feed reader is for first-timers (it doesn't need installation -- it's a web page), and for more experienced users. is also free and good. is also good (Windows and Mac, $40). is another great feed reader -- it integrates into MS Outlook, and allows you to simply right-click on the button or link to a feed to get a drop-down menu with a "subscribe in NewsGator" option (no need to ever see the raw XML code). And there are many, many other programs. is a free Web-based service through which you can set up your own personal feed reader account. It's an especially easy way to start using RSS feeds, and doesn't require that you install new software -- but there are you should be aware of before you start to use it. [Similarly, Livejournal users can just subscribe to "syndicated accounts" like When you subscribe to a feed, you tell your feed reader that you want it to periodically poll a certain site's RSS feed file. To do this, just click on the that says something like "XML" or "RSS" that you see on so many sites today. That will take you to the rather cryptic feed file. Then, simply grab the URL for that page and plug it into your feed reader. It's somewhat similar to bookmarking a page in your Web browser. Then, when you want to read the news, you tell your feed reader to go out to the feeds you've subscribed to and grab their latest information. Then, your feed reader displays that information in a way that's similar to what you see on Google News -- a list of the latest headlines from each source, sorted however you prefer, sometimes with brief descriptions of the content, and always with a link to the full content on the publisher's site. Again, this process is spam-proof! That's the main reason why I'm an RSS evangelist. Only the feed publisher can designate what information gets into the feed, and the only information the subscriber pulls down is what the publisher put there. When you subscribe to an RSS feed, you're not giving your e-mail address to anyone, they can't send you stuff you don't want. This is a huge deal, especially for people who currently publish or subscribe to e-mail announcement services. Spam has become so pervasive that up to 38% of all opt-in e-mail messages (stuff that people have specifically asked to receive) get blocked by spam filters. My colleague on this problem last August. There are now lots of programs available that automatically create and update RSS feeds . These are standalone or built into blogging or content-management software. Many people use RSS-generator plugins/templates for common blogging software like To learn more about publishing an RSS feed, here's a great RSS primer for publishers and content providers .

For example, if you updated your file twice an hour, updatePeriod would be "hourly" and updateFrequency would be "2". The syndication module borrows from Ian Davis's Open Content Syndication (OCS) directory format. It supercedes the RSS 0.91 skipDay and skipHour elements. Describes the period over which the channel format is updated. Acceptable values are: hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly. If omitted, daily is assumed. Used to describe the frequency of updates in relation to the update period. A positive integer indicates how many times in that period the channel is updated. For example, an updatePeriod of daily, and an updateFrequency of 2 indicates the channel format is updated twice daily. If omitted a value of 1 is assumed. Defines a base date to be used in concert with updatePeriod and updateFrequency to calculate the publishing schedule. The date format takes the form: yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm ( 'hourly' | 'daily' | 'weekly' | 'monthly' | 'yearly' ) ( a positive integer ) ( #PCDATA ) [ Meerkat: An Open Wire Service XML: A Disruptive Technology XML is placing increasingly heavy loads on the existing technical infrastructure of the Internet.
