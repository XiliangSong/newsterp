News British police make 4 terror arrests Thu May 10, 2:37 AM ET LONDON - British police arrested four people Wednesday in connection with the suicide bombings that killed 52 bus and subway passengers in London in 2005. Police refused to confirm reports that the wife of one of the bombers was detained. They said a woman and two men were arrested in West Yorkshire and a 22-year-old man was arrested in Birmingham. All were arrested on suspicion of the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism and were being taken to London for interrogation, police said. Searches were under way at two apartments in Birmingham, and at five addresses in West Yorkshire &#151; two houses in Dewsbury, two houses in the Beeston neighborhood of Leeds and one house in Batley, police said. Mohammed Sidique Khan, identified as one of the four London bombers, was a resident of Dewsbury and had grown up in Beeston. The British Broadcasting Corp. report that Khan's wife, Hasina Patel, 29, was among those arrested. "We never discuss the identity of people who have been arrested," a police spokeswoman said on condition of anonymity in line with force policy. The bombers struck on three subway trains and a double-decker bus on July 7, 2005 &#151; the worst terrorist attack in British history. In March, police arrested three people, all from the same West Yorkshire area as three of the four suicide bombers. They were charged on April 5 with conspiring with the attackers. Those charged were Mohammed Shakil, of Beeston; Sadeer Saleem, of Beeston; and Waheed Ali, who recently lived in London but was formerly from Beeston. London's Metropolitan Police said they were continuing a "painstaking investigation with a substantial amount of information being analyzed and investigated." "As we have said previously, we are determined to follow the evidence wherever it takes us to identify any other person who may have been involved, in any way, in the terrorist attacks," the department said. "We need to know who else, apart from the bombers, knew what they were planning. Did anyone encourage them? Did anyone help them with money, or accommodation?"

News Democrats, White House clash on homeland security Wed May 9, 7:26 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives defied a White House veto threat on Wednesday, voting to increase job protections at the Department of and provide the agency with &#36;2.1 billion more than President George W. Bush President George W. Bush On a vote of 296-126, the House topped the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override a presidential veto, and sent the measure to the Senate for consideration. "This bill sends a message to the president -- America&#39;s security cannot be done on the cheap," said Rep. Bennie Thompson ( ), a Mississippi Democrat and chief sponsor of the bill. Republicans voiced outrage that before approving the bill Democrats removed or weakened a dozen provisions which had been approved unanimously by the Homeland Security Committee in March. "They were good ideas, but we haven&#39;t had the benefit of giving these novel ideas the full consideration that they deserve," said Thompson, who chairs the committee. These provisions would toughen penalties for alien smuggling; prohibit homeland security grants to colleges that bar Coast Guard recruiters; provide funds to protect the food supply, and fund employee immigration checks at high-risk sites, such as airports and nuclear power plants. House Republicans leaders dubbed the measure, "Homeland Security bill, minus security." Yet 73 Republicans joined 223 Democrats in passing it. The bill would authorize &#36;39.8 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2008, &#36;2.1 billion more than requested by Bush. While designed to bolster emergency response efforts, the bill would give workers at the Department of Homeland Security the same protections as other federal employees. This, the administration contends, would reduce the flexibility it needs to assign workers to ever-changing threats. In addition, the bill would create what the White House called "burdensome and, in some cases, unworkable" acquisition policies. The administration also voiced concerns about a proposed Office of Health Affairs and new requirements for local, state and federal authorities to share information.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070509/pl_nm/usa_qaeda_dc	Doctor in NY terrorism case denies al Qaeda link - Yahoo! News Doctor in NY terrorism case denies al Qaeda link Wed May 9, 7:35 PM ET NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Florida doctor accused of swearing allegiance to al Qaeda and agreeing to treat wounded fighters testified on Wednesday that he supported neither the militant Islamist group nor its leader and was confused when he appeared to do so. Rafiq Sabir, 52, is on trial in federal court in Manhattan on charges of conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda. He faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted. Sabir testified that he misunderstood a May 2005 meeting in New York at which he was secretly recorded pledging allegiance to al Qaeda and "Sheikh Osama" by an agent posing as a recruiter. "Osama is a common name," Sabir said. He said he did not think "Osama" referred to Osama bin Laden and did not realize he was pledging allegiance to al Qaeda. "There is no way I am going to align myself with al Qaeda; that is just not me," he said, before condemning "all the nasty things they have done around the world, killing people, innocent people, the atrocities." He said he also was confused when he promised to help "mujahideen" and said he thought that meant Iraqis, not al Qaeda fighters. Sabir also said that, as a doctor, he had an obligation to help people. "What was on my mind was the people of ," he said. "I had no idea he was talking about al Qaeda." Prosecutors say Sabir knew he was agreeing to help al Qaeda, as did three other defendants who have already pleaded guilty. In April, New York jazz musician Tarik Shah and Mahmud Faruq Brent, a Maryland cab driver, pleaded guilty to related charges, but have not been sentenced. A fourth defendant, Brooklyn bookstore owner Abdulrahman Farhane, pleaded guilty and last month was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Prosecutors were expected to cross-examine Sabir on Thursday.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070509/wl_nm/germany_terrorism_raid_dc	Germany launches anti-militant raids before summit - Yahoo! News Germany launches anti-militant raids before summit Wed May 9, 7:01 PM ET BERLIN (Reuters) - German police used water cannon to disperse protesters in the northern city of Hamburg on Wednesday following a series of raids on anti-globalization organizations ahead of a June G8 summit on the Baltic coast. Police said three officers were injured as demonstrators protesting against the raids threw bottles and stones outside a Hamburg cultural center. Arrests were made but a police spokeswoman could not confirm how many. Earlier, some 900 security officials searched 40 sites in Berlin, Brandenburg, Hamburg, Bremen, Schleswig-Holstein and Lower Saxony as part of two separate probes into anti-globalization militants, the federal prosecutor&#39;s office said in a statement. "We suspect those targeted, who belong to the militant extreme-left scene, of founding a terrorist organization or being members of such an organization, that is planning arson attacks and other actions to severely disrupt or prevent the early summer G8 summit in Heiligendamm from taking place," the prosecutor&#39;s office said. German Chancellor Angela Merkel will host the leaders of Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Russia and the United States at the June 6-8 summit, which will focus on climate change, African poverty and economic cooperation. Separately on Wednesday, Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble announced a tightening of border controls ahead of the summit, action similar to that he took during last year&#39;s World Cup tournament to prevent an influx of soccer hooligans. "We are particularly focused on dangers arising from violent globalization opponents," the ministry said. The two investigations are aimed at 21 far-left activists whose names are known to German authorities, as well as other unidentified suspects. Police told Reuters no arrests had been made in Wednesday&#39;s raids. Prosecutors said they believed their targets were behind 20 or more arson attacks and other incidents in the Hamburg and Berlin area over the past two years. In December a car was set on fire in front of the home of Deputy Finance Minister Thomas Mirow and windows and walls of his house were splattered with paint. Anti-G8 group "Gipfelsoli" denounced the raids and accused authorities of a "wave of repression" to dismantle the movement&#39;s communication network. "In my opinion the goal of today&#39;s searches is to gain information about potential G8 summit actions and perhaps to scare those people who want to take part in the protests," Christoph Kliesing, a lawyer who represents left-wing groups, told a news conference in Berlin. Germany has not experienced major left-wing violence since the militant Red Army Faction (RAF), which waged a bloody two-decade long campaign of killings and kidnappings, announced in 1998 that it was disbanding. Authorities are taking no chances in their bid to ensure the summit goes as smoothly as the World Cup did. A 2.5-metre (8 foot) high steel fence, topped with razor wire, has been placed in a 14-km ring around Heiligendamm and police will control access through airport-style X-ray machines. Around 40 km down the coast from the Kempinski Hotel where the leaders will meet, a demonstration of up to 100,000 people is expected to take place the weekend before the event.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20070510/wl_afp/unworldsurvey	Large majorities favor giving UN more powers: global surveys - Yahoo! News Large majorities favor giving UN more powers: global surveys Thu May 10, 2:23 AM ET UNITED NATIONS (AFP) - Global surveys show large majorities favoring the UN Security Council using force to stop genocide, nuclear proliferation and terrorism, according to findings released Thursday. The findings were made public by two US research organizations, the Chicago Council on Global Affairs (CCGA) and WorldPublicOpinion.org, based on surveys conducted with polling agencies in 18 nations representing roughly 56 percent of the worldÃÂs population. "While leaders of nation states may be wary of giving the UN more power, it is clear that publics around the world are comfortable with the idea of a stronger UN," said Steven Kull, editor of Washington-based WorldPublicOpinion.Org. Large majorities in 12 of 14 countries polled agreed that the UN Security Council should have the right to use of force to "prevent severe human rights violations such as genocide," with the highest levels of support in France (85 percent), (83 percent) and the United States (83 percent). A majority in eight countries led by China (76 percent), the US (74 percent) and the Palestinians (69 percent) felt the Council has not just the right but also the "responsibility" to intervene militarily to protect people from severe human rights abuses. Large majorities averaging 71 percent and led by Israel (85 percent) and France (84 percent) also backed the use of force to "stop a country from supporting terrorist groups." Fifty-two percent on average agreed that military force should be allowed to prevent a country that does not have nuclear weapons from acquiring them, with highest support in Mexico (70 percent), Israel (62 percent) and the US (62 percent). Asked whether their own country should be "more willing to make decisions within the UN" when dealing with international issues even if this meant their country having to "go along with a policy that is not its first choice," 78 percent in China, 68 percent in France, 60 percent in the United States and surprisingly 54 percent in Israel agreed. "Having a standing UN peacekeeping force selected, trained and commanded by the " was backed by majorities in 12 of the 14 countries polled, 64 percent on average. The surveys were conducted from July 2006 to March this year in China, India, the United States, Indonesia, France, Russia, Thailand, Ukraine, Poland, , the Philippines, Australia, Argentina, Peru, Israel, Armenia and the Palestinian territories. In a separate review of US opinion, a July 2006 Chicago Council poll showed that 79 percent of American respondents endorsed the goal of "strengthening the UN." A majority of 66 percent in a December 2006 WPO/KN poll felt that the UN becoming significantly more powerful in world affairs "would be mostly positive." Several other polls in recent years indicated that a robust majority of Americans wants their government to work through the UN more than it does, even when reminded of the potential costs involved. A Chicago Council survey last July also found broad US public support for enlarging the UN Security Council. Sixty-six percent of Americans polled felt Japan should be admitted. 2 car bombs at Baghdad bridges kill 12 Britain's Brown vows to learn from Iraq Pope canonizes first Brazilian saint Sept. 11 suspect loses appeal in Germany U.S. confirms Afghan civilian casualties Most Viewed - World Iran, North Korea seek to boost cooperation Koreas adopt military agreement Britain's Brown vows to learn from Iraq Pope canonizes first Brazilian saint 2 car bombs at Baghdad bridges kill 12 CNN - 40 minutes ago Radler can&#39;t be trusted, Greenspan says CBC.ca - 2 hours, 52 minutes ago Politics and the Pope ABC News - Fri May 11, 9:34 AM ET Blair endorses Brown as successor CBC.ca - Fri May 11, 9:28 AM ET Mothers Day Flowers: $20 Guaranteed Mother's Day delivery.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_eu/britain_police_shooting	No disciplinary action for London police - Yahoo! News No disciplinary action for London police By ROBERT BARR, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 9:16 AM ET LONDON - Eleven police officers will not face disciplinary action in the death of a Brazilian man who was mistaken for a terrorist and gunned down in the subway days after the 2005 London transit bombings, a police commission said Friday. Jean Charles de Menezes, 27, was shot seven times in the head by Scotland Yard anti-terror officers as he sat on a London subway train July 22, 2005 &#151; two weeks after four suicide bombers killed themselves and 52 commuters on three subway trains and a bus, and a day after a failed set of attacks. Police acknowledged that they had wrongly identified de Menezes. Prosecutors decided last year they would not seek criminal charges against the officers involved. On Friday, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said the officers would also not face disciplinary action on the force. "The grief and anger of (de Menezes') family is entirely understandable and &#151; as I have been powerfully reminded &#151; remains unassuaged," said the commission's chairman, Nick Hardwick. "I would not do anything lightly that adds to that grief or anger." He said the decision not to discipline the officers was made after reviewing the evidence of the shooting, which he said pointed to the "challenges facing officers" in the days after the July 7 suicide bombings. De Menezes' family was outraged over the decision. "I cannot believe the police have been able to get away with this. It is disgraceful the IPCC can make such a decision &#151; they are letting the police get away with murder," said Patricia da Silva Armani, slain man's cousin. "First officials killed my cousin, then they lied about it and now the officers are walking away without any punishment," she said. A decision regarding four more senior officers involved in the shooting was deferred until the end of a legal case against the Metropolitan Police Department. The force faces charges under a health and safety law for allegedly endangering the public's safety during the shooting. The police force pleaded not guilty to the charges in September. If convicted, the department could face an unlimited fine.

News Democrats, White House clash on homeland security Wed May 9, 7:26 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives defied a White House veto threat on Wednesday, voting to increase job protections at the Department of and provide the agency with &#36;2.1 billion more than President George W. Bush President George W. Bush On a vote of 296-126, the House topped the two-thirds majority that would be needed to override a presidential veto, and sent the measure to the Senate for consideration. "This bill sends a message to the president -- America&#39;s security cannot be done on the cheap," said Rep. Bennie Thompson ( ), a Mississippi Democrat and chief sponsor of the bill. Republicans voiced outrage that before approving the bill Democrats removed or weakened a dozen provisions which had been approved unanimously by the Homeland Security Committee in March. "They were good ideas, but we haven&#39;t had the benefit of giving these novel ideas the full consideration that they deserve," said Thompson, who chairs the committee. These provisions would toughen penalties for alien smuggling; prohibit homeland security grants to colleges that bar Coast Guard recruiters; provide funds to protect the food supply, and fund employee immigration checks at high-risk sites, such as airports and nuclear power plants. House Republicans leaders dubbed the measure, "Homeland Security bill, minus security." Yet 73 Republicans joined 223 Democrats in passing it. The bill would authorize &#36;39.8 billion for the Department of Homeland Security for fiscal year 2008, &#36;2.1 billion more than requested by Bush. While designed to bolster emergency response efforts, the bill would give workers at the Department of Homeland Security the same protections as other federal employees. This, the administration contends, would reduce the flexibility it needs to assign workers to ever-changing threats. In addition, the bill would create what the White House called "burdensome and, in some cases, unworkable" acquisition policies. The administration also voiced concerns about a proposed Office of Health Affairs and new requirements for local, state and federal authorities to share information.

News Syrian action over Iraq, terror key to better US ties: Rice Thu May 10, 11:27 AM ET WASHINGTON (AFP) - US Secretary of State Thursday to close its border to foreign fighters and to crack down on Palestinian extremists if it wants to thaw frosty ties with Washington. Addressing members of Congress after she held an unprecedented meeting with her Syrian counterpart Walid Muallem last week, Rice said any improvement to US-Syria relations hinged on progress on those fronts. "It was not a conversation about US-Syria relations but about what Syria needs to do to stem the tide of foreign fighters" among other issues, she told a Senate foreign relations hearing. "Syria continues to be a major funder of terrorism, a major harborer of those elements of the Palestinian political elite for instance who are opposed to a two-state solution, who are the ones who continue to perpetrate violence in the Palestinian territories and in The secretary of state said that she told Muallem during their talks last Thursday, held on the sidelines of a conference on Iraq in the Egyptian resort of Sharm El-Sheikh, "that we should talk about Iraq." "But US-Syria relations would depend on a great deal more." Washington accuses Damascus of letting anti-US insurgents cross from Syria to Iraq, and of supporting terrorist groups in Lebanon and in the Palestinian territories. Syria meanwhile Thursday ruled out any cooperation with an international court to try suspects for the 2005 murder of former Lebanese premier Rafiq Hariri if it threatens its sovereignty. Syria, which has been implicated in a UN probe over the Hariri assassination despite its repeated denials, is opposed to plans for the court which have been endorsed by the UN Security Council. "Syria needs to allow that tribunal to go forward because people need to answer to what happened to former prime minister Hariri," Rice said.

News Attacks planned for U.S. targets in Germany: media WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and German officials say they believed terrorists were planning an attack on U.S. military personnel or tourists in Germany, ABC News reported on its Web site on Friday. "The information behind the threat is very real," a senior U.S. official told ABC News. German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told ABC: "The danger level is high. We are part of the global threat by Islamist terrorism." U.S. air marshals are providing additional protection of flights between Germany and the United States, law enforcement officials told ABCNews.com. The report, quoting U.S. and German law enforcement officials, said Patch Barracks, headquarters to the U.S. military&#39;s European Command, could be a target following reports that suspected terrorists had conducted surveillance at the facility.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_us/fort_dix_plot	Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail - Yahoo! News Fort Dix suspects all are denied bail By GEOFF MULVIHILL, Associated press Writer CAMDEN, N.J. - Six Muslim men suspected of plotting to massacre U.S. soldiers at Fort Dix were ordered held without bail Friday. Prosecutors argued that the men, all born outside the United States, pose a flight risk. They are being held at a federal detention center in Philadelphia. The men were arrested Monday night during what the said was an attempt to buy AK-47 machine guns, M-16s and other weapons. They targeted Fort Dix, a post 25 miles east of Philadelphia that is used primarily to train reservists, partly because one of them had delivered pizzas there and was familiar with the base, according to court filings. Their objective was to kill "as many American soldiers as possible," the documents said. The men have lived in and around Philadelphia for years, worshipped at moderate mosques and worked blue-collar jobs installing roofs, driving a cab, delivering pizzas and baking bread. Four are ethnic Albanians from the former Yugoslavia, one is from Jordan and one is from Turkey. As they were led into the courtroom, each of the suspects smiled to relatives and friends, many of whom wept and blew kisses to them. Only one of the men, Mohamad Ibrahim Shnewer, 22, asked to be released on bail, and friends and relatives offered to post properties they owned as collateral. Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Stigall argued against letting Shnewer be released to the custody of his parents while awaiting trial. He said many of the illegal actions that the government alleges Shnewer committed happened or were planned at his parents' house. Defense lawyers for some of the men said they are considering attacking the prosecution's reliance on two paid informants who infiltrated the group more than a year ago and recorded conversations with the defendants. Authorities said they first learned about the men in January 2006 after a tip from a clerk at a Mount Laurel electronics store. The clerk called police because a home video the men wanted transferred to a DVD looked like it might have terrorist links, U.S. Attorney Christopher J. Christie said. Earlier this year, authorities said, the men took a training trip to the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, where they fired weapons and played paintball to prepare for an attack. Five of the men &#151; Shnewer; Serdar Tatar, 23; Dritan "Anthony" or "Tony" Duka, 28; Shain Duka, 26; and Eljvir "Elvis" Duka, 23 &#151; are charged with conspiring to kill uniformed military personnel, an offense punishable by life in prison. Agron Abdullahu, 24, is charged with helping illegal immigrants obtain weapons. He could face 10 years in prison if convicted. Abdullahu, who faces the least serious charges of the six, will have another bail hearing next Thursday.

Media RSS enables content publishers and bloggers to syndicate multimedia content such as TV and video clips, movies, images, and audio. is a sub-element of .

Additional supported attributes for describing images, audio, and video may be added in future revisions of this document. have no limitations on the number of times they can appear, the general nature of RSS should be preserved: an represents a "story". Simply stated, this is similar to the blog style of syndication. However, if one is using this module to strictly publish media, there should be one element for each media object/group. This is to allow for proper attribution for the origination of the media content through the element. It also allows the full benefit of the other RSS elements to be realized. The following elements are optional and may appear as sub-elements of When an element appears at a shallow level, such as , it means that the element should be applied to every media object within its scope. Duplicated elements appearing at deeper levels of the document tree have higher priority over other levels. For example, level elements are favored over level elements.

Currently, restrictions are based on distributor (uri) and country codes. This element is purely informational and no obligation can be assumed or implied. Only one element of the same can be applied to a media object - all others will be ignored. Entities in this element should be space separated.

This element has 1 required attribute, and 1 optional attribute (with strict requirements for its exclusion). indicates the type of relationship that the restriction represents (allow | deny). In the example above, the media object should only be syndicated in Australia and the United States. It is a required attribute. If the "allow" element is empty and the type is relationship is "allow", it is assumed that the empty list means "allow nobody" and the media should not be syndicated. A more explicit method would be: specifies the type of restriction (country | uri) that the media can be syndicated. It is an optional attribute; however can only be excluded when using one of the literal values "all" or "none". "country" allows restrictions to be placed based on country code. [ "uri" allows restrictions based on URI. Examples: urn:apple, http://images.google.com, urn:yahoo, etc. The following are encouraged "best practices" when using Media RSS: If your feed is not an "incremental" in the traditional RSS sense, but rather an entire snapshot of all media available, please take note of the element. This element when set to "false" correctly informs the RSS reader that the current feed replaces the previously fetched feed. If you prefer to syndicate media more along the lines of traditional RSS, this specification also allows you to daisy chain multiple feeds together to compose a history of media that is available on your site. Expirations Using Dublin Core To the best of your ability, media that is scheduled to expire after a given time should be duly noted through Dublin Core's A recently created movie, using the RSS 2.0 element and without the use of the Media RSS module.

News U.S. charges suspected bin Laden driver Thu May 10, 7:53 PM ET SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico - The United States filed charges of conspiracy and providing support for terrorism Thursday against a Guantanamo detainee accused of working as a driver and bodyguard for Salim Ahmed Hamdan is the third Guantanamo detainee to be charged under a new set of rules signed last year by after the Supreme Court rejected the previous system. Hamdan, who is from Yemen, has been detained at Guantanamo since May 2002. It was his legal challenge that forced the Bush administration and Congress to draft new rules for the military trials, known as commissions, for the men held at the Guantanamo Bay detention center in eastern Cuba. In the charging documents, the military said Hamdan conspired with bin Laden and other al-Qaida leaders in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the attack on the in 2000, and the terrorist attacks in the United States on Sept. 11, 2001. In addition to working as bin Laden's driver and bodyguard, the U.S. said Hamdan transported and delivered weapons to al-Qaida and its associates and trained at terrorist camps. The documents do not disclose the potential sentence Hamdan could receive in a military trial, but they specify that he would not be subject to the death penalty.

News White House doles out millions in grants By DEVLIN BARRETT, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 5:37 PM ET WASHINGTON - The Bush administration on Thursday divided $445 million in grants to protect commuters, shipping ports, and transit systems from terrorist attacks &#151; a 10 percent increase from last year. devoted most of the money to seaports and mass transit: $202 million for ports, $155 million in grants to bus and rail lines, and $48.5 million for critical infrastructure around the United States. In the annual up-and-down of anti-terror grants to major ports, New York and San Francisco did well, while Louisiana and Texas suffered setbacks. "In many places there will be ebbs and flows in the funding," said DHS Deputy Secretary Michael Jackson. Smaller amounts were distributed to protect the nation's passenger rail carrier Amtrak, and bus services like Greyhound and Trailways, as well as trucking and passenger ferry services. Grant awards are closely scrutinized by city and state officials who measure their funding against previous years &#151; though the bigger fight is usually over which cities are judged at highest risk of attack, and how much money they each get. The exact grant amounts are based on applications from cities, and some, like Cleveland, didn't even bother to ask for port security funds, officials said. "We gave them every chance, we mailed them the packet," said Jackson, who called the money distribution process "a combination of art and science." New York City, which has complained of being short changed for years saying grants are spread around too widely, was a big recipient of transit and port aid again this year. The city and surrounding areas in New Jersey and Connecticut receiving about $93 million, compared to $79.5 million in 2006, and $50 million in 2005. Sen. Charles Schumer ( ), D-N.Y. called the increase to New York "a welcome sign that DHS may now realize that the terrorists' number one target should be number one on the list for funding." Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, D-Md., criticized the distribution for its 60 percent cut in funding to the Port of Baltimore. Louisiana saw nearly half of its port money from the previous year evaporate, although the New Orleans port saw its funding jump from $737,000 to $11 million. Baton Rouge had an 86 percent drop from $9 million to $1.6 million, while South Louisiana's port dollars went from $11 million to $2 million. Jackson said the $23.7 million total funding for Louisiana in 2006 was an anomaly and that the revised amount this year more accurately reflected what the state has been receiving annually over the last five years. Also facing a one-year downturn were the Texas ports of Beaumont and Port Arthur. Their funding dropped more than 50 percent, from nearly $11 million to $5.3 million. The money tide rose dramatically for port facilities in the San Francisco Bay area, however, leaping from $1.2 million in 2006 to $14.2 million this year.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070510/ap_on_re_us/national_guard_stretched_thin	Govs worry about depleted National Guard - Yahoo! News Govs worry about depleted National Guard By MITCH STACY, Associated Press Writer Thu May 10, 7:41 PM ET TAMPA, Fla. - With repeated deployments to leaving state National Guards without nearly half of their required equipment, some governors are loudly questioning whether they will be able to handle the next hurricane, wildfire or terrorist attack at home. "We are not going to be able to continue to rely on the National Guard as a full-time operational force" overseas if the Guardsmen are to do their job at home, North Carolina Gov. Mike Easley said. Easley said his state has about half the equipment it needs and could probably respond adequately to a hurricane, but "a pandemic or something like that may be a different question." The widespread problem of permanently losing National Guard equipment to the war was pushed to the forefront this week when Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius complained that shortages of equipment and well-trained personnel slowed Guard response to the killer tornadoes that ravaged her state. "A lot of equipment has gone to Iraq and the equipment doesn't come back when the troops come back," California Gov. The California National Guard is missing 700 Humvees and over 1,100 high-water vehicles &#151; nearly half the number it's supposed to have, according to documents reviewed by The AP. The Guard also has just 1,301 M4 machine guns, or less than a third of its required stockpile. Arkansas Gov. Mike Beebe acknowledged that his state, with much of its National Guard equipment in Iraq, could have similar problems as Kansas if disaster struck. Beebe said that much of the Arkansas Guard's engineering unit is deployed in Iraq, and that the state's Blackhawk helicopters also are overseas. "It would be nice if the federal government would provide (soldiers in Iraq) with sufficient materials so that the states would still have sufficient materials for their people in case of a crisis," Beebe said, National Guard troops take heavy equipment, such as Humvees, to Iraq where they are specially outfitted for combat and then left behind. Some states reported the equipment was eventually replaced or returned, but severely worn. Many are still waiting. Connecticut, for example, is missing more than 200 high-mobility multipurpose vehicles, a Chinook CH-47D cargo helicopter, 1,500 pairs of night-vision goggles and 21 large support vehicles such as tankers, wreckers and heavy cargo vehicles. officials have said that equipment sharing agreements among the states would ensure there would be adequate hardware available to handle any disaster. Such sharing is common place &#151; 48 states that belong to an emergency assistance compact, an agreement to help each other in emergencies. The Pentagon acknowledged this week that Army National Guard units had only 56 percent of their required equipment, the lowest levels since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said the Bush administration is asking Congress for $22 billion for the Army National Guard over the next five years, which would take Guard equipment levels up to 76 percent. Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley's office released a memo this week saying that the state's National Guard is facing "critical equipment shortfalls to meet its domestic homeland security mission." The report found "serious potential deficiencies in an array of basic, multipurpose items whose utility is clear for responding to incidents ranging from hurricanes to acts of terrorism." In a letter to this week, Democratic senator and presidential candidate Barack Obama ( ) said the National Guard's equipment was stretched thin in his home state of Illinois. Citing data from the , Obama added that the Illinois National Guard has only 45.6 percent of needed equipment on hand &#151; less than half of what he said would be needed to handle a Mississippi River flood, respond to deadly tornadoes or evacuate civilians wounded in an attack. "Our National Guard should never be overstretched to the point where we allow our homeland security and emergency response capabilities to erode," Obama wrote. "We cannot afford to learn a lesson about unmet needs each time a disaster strikes." The biggest fear in Nevada is the upcoming fire season. Last year, fire burned more than 2,000 square miles in the state. Guard officials there say they are ready, but Democrats in the Nevada Senate signed a letter urging Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons to petition President Bush to call Nevada guardsmen home by November. Gibbons does not intend to petition the president, his spokesman said. Oregon officials also worry about responding to earthquakes. Geologists say there is potential for a major inland earthquake or a tsunami off the Oregon coast. "We are in as good shape as we can be, given the circumstances," said Jake Weigler, spokesman for Gov. Ted Kulongoski. "But obviously, these war deployments have hurt our abilities to respond to these types of disasters." In Florida, where officials are preparing for a predicted busy hurricane season, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson ( ) has expressed concern that the state National Guard has only 53 percent of the dual-use equipment it once had for responding to a storm or domestic disturbance, according to the GAO analysis. But a Florida National Guard spokesman, Lt. Col. Ron Tittle, noted Thursday that the Guard responded to the 2004 and 2005 hurricanes with less equipment and fewer troops than are available now. "It's not a show stopper," Tittle said. "We proved we can respond effectively in 2004 and 2004. We will be there. There is no question in our minds &#151; we've got sufficient equipment to satisfy any emergency management requirements in Florida."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070510/ap_on_re_us/terrorism_arrest	Doctor in terror trial defends himself - Yahoo! News Doctor in terror trial defends himself By LARRY NEUMEISTER, Associated Press Writer Wed May 9, 10:54 PM ET NEW YORK - A Florida doctor accused of pledging to support terrorists testified Wednesday that he never believed he was agreeing to aid al-Qaida when he took an oath from an agent the government says was posing as a terror recruiter. "I am not a member of al-Qaida," Rafiq Abdus Sabir told the jury during his trial in U.S. District Court in Manhattan. "It is wrong to kill." He said there was "no way I'm going to align myself with al-Qaida." "That is just not me," he said. "I never had any thoughts about them whatsoever and all the nasty things they have done around the world, killing people, innocent people mostly and the big atrocities they have done around the world." Sabir was arrested after an FBI sting operation and charged with providing material support to a terrorist organization, a charge that could carry a prison sentence of up to 30 years if he is convicted. On Monday, FBI agent Ali Soufan testified that he administered an oath in May 2004 to Sabir and his good friend, jazz musician and martial arts expert Tarik Shah, in which both men pledged their support to al-Qaida and its leader, A tape recording of the pledge ceremony and Soufan's testimony are the centerpiece of the government's case against Sabir, who is standing trial alone after three co-defendants &#151; Shah, a Washington, D.C., cab driver and a Brooklyn bookstore owner &#151; pleaded guilty and agreed to sentences between 13 and 15 years in prison. Sabir said he thought the oath was a pledge to support Muslim brothers, meaning all Muslims, and it was the traditional oath given for centuries to Muslims who wanted to strengthen their commitment to their faith. He said he never heard bin Laden's name and, "I did not think al-Qaida was involved in this in any way, shape or form." When Soufan mentioned "Sheik Osama" on the tape, Sabir never thought it referred to bin Laden because "Osama" is a common name and "sheik" can only be used to refer to someone who has received religious training, which bin Laden has not, the doctor testified. Sabir said that when he made his religious pledge, known as pledging bayat, he had "no idea what I was getting into." "I had no idea what this bayat was going to cost me," he added. "I had no idea it was going to end up in something like this."

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070510/ts_nm/iraq_dc	Bush faces pressure on Iraq as Blair leaves - Yahoo! News Bush faces pressure on Iraq as Blair leaves By Steve Holland and Richard Cowan Thu May 10, 3:32 PM ET WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President George W. Bush President George W. Bush faced mounting pressure on Thursday from fellow Republicans as well as Democrats to show progress in within months or risk a collapse in support for the war. On the day that Bush&#39;s closest international ally on the war, British Prime Minister , announced he would step down next month, Democrats in the House of Representatives refused to back away from proposals to change course in Iraq. Bush, who vetoed a &#36;124 billion war funding bill last week because it set a deadline for the withdrawal of combat troops, fired back by saying Congress should give military commanders more time and flexibility. As for the House Democrats&#39; bill providing some war funds now and possibly more later, Bush said, "I&#39;ll veto the bill if it&#39;s this haphazard, piecemeal funding." After a meeting with U.S. commanders for an update on the war, Bush hailed Blair as a "political figure who is capable of thinking over the horizon," after the British leader made the expected announcement that he would step down in June. Blair told Britons disillusioned by the war, which severely damaged both leaders&#39; standing at home and abroad, that he had done what he believed was right. Members of Bush&#39;s Republican Party also have begun to more publicly question the war, which has killed at least 3,377 U.S. soldiers and injured more than 24,000 since 2003. "The American people are war-fatigued," Illinois Republican Rep. Ray LaHood ( ) told CNN on Thursday. "The American people want to know that there&#39;s a way out. The American people want to know that we&#39;re having success." LaHood was among 11 moderate Republicans who met privately with Bush at the White House on Tuesday. Most, if not all, could face stiff Democratic challenges in 2008 elections. They told Bush that by September the troop buildup he ordered for Iraq three months ago must show progress. Bush is sending 30,000 additional troops to Iraq, mainly for the offensive in Baghdad, which is regarded as a last-ditch effort to pull Iraq back from the brink of civil war. In a sign of growing U.S. impatience at Iraq&#39;s slowness in passing laws on oil distribution and other key measures, U.S. Vice President made an unannounced visit there this week and told U.S. soldiers on Thursday that militants had made Iraq the frontline in the war on terrorism. "We are here, above all, because the terrorists who have declared war on America and other free nations have made Iraq the central front in that war," Cheney told the troops at a base near &#39;s home town of Tikrit. In a positive sign, the office of Iraq&#39;s Sunni Vice President Tareq al-Hashemi said the senior Sunni leader had been "comforted" by recent meetings with political leaders aimed at addressing Sunni Arab concerns. Hashemi and other senior figures from Iraq&#39;s largest Sunni Arab bloc had warned they might quit the government of Shi&#39;ite Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki if their grievances were ignored. On Wednesday, Cheney held round table talks with Hashemi, Maliki and President Jalal Talabani, a Kurd. Sunnis want to increase their representation in Iraq&#39;s security forces and soften laws that prohibit thousands of members of Saddam&#39;s former Sunni-dominated Baath Party from playing a role in public life. Democratic lawmakers argue that withholding some funds could put pressure on Iraqis to step up attempts to stabilize their country. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( ) scheduled votes for later in the day on bills that would provide partial war funding and begin withdrawing troops. One bill, which even backers say will be defeated, would flatly deny funds for Bush&#39;s troop escalation and require U.S. troops to finish withdrawing within six to nine months. More likely to pass the House is a bill that would give the &#36;42.8 billion in emergency funds so it can continue waging war in Iraq and for the next two to three months. Congress would then vote in July on whether an additional &#36;52.8 billion would be released after Bush provides new assessments of the war.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070510/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/national_guard_authority	Gates rejects emergency command proposal - Yahoo! News Gates rejects emergency command proposal By LOLITA C. BALDOR, Associated Press Writer Wed May 9, 11:02 PM ET WASHINGTON - Defense Secretary Robert Gates has rejected a proposal to let governors command active duty troops responding to disasters, officials said Wednesday, though the will grant National Guard leaders more authority to coordinate with other military and homeland security agencies. Gates told Congress Wednesday he had approved 20 of the 23 changes recommended recently by an independent commission in an effort to improve Guard funding, equipment and coordination in emergencies. His comments came just days after tornadoes in Kansas highlighted deficiencies with Guard equipment and gaps in planning that were exposed by the Gulf hurricanes more than 18 months ago. Gates did not reveal which recommendations from the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves that he rejected. But two defense officials familiar with the matter told The Associated Press he didn't agree with the panel's suggestion that governors be allowed to direct active duty troops responding to emergencies in their states. The officials requested anonymity because Gates' decisions on the commission report have not yet been made public. Asked for comment, a spokeswoman for Oregon Gov. Ted Kulongoski said, "The governor doesn't believe the best structure is dual command during a time of emergency." "He thinks there needs to be further discussion and review of whether a governor and adjutant general should be given command of all troops assisting in the response during a time of emergency," said the spokeswoman, Anna Richter-Taylor. Arizona Gov. Janet Napolitano, chairwoman of the National Governors Association, had no immediate comment on the development, spokesman Jeanine L'Ecuyer said. In previous situations such as Hurricane Katrina, military leaders have worked side by side with governors but have maintained command of their active duty troops. The governors have authority over their own National Guard troops during state disasters, but the U.S. military takes command if the Guard is federalized by the president, such as in major crises such as the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. The governors cannot command regular, active-duty forces. The commission in its March 1 report, concluded that states and governors are not adequately considered in decisions relating to the Guard. Gates concurred with the panel's other proposals to have the governors work more closely with the Pentagon. He told the Senate Defense Appropriations panel Wednesday that the department is "trying to deal with some of these Guard problems. And we will be more than happy to work with you all, with the governors association, with the adjutants general to get at this problem." Specifically, he said, he approved making the chief of the National Guard a four-star general, rather than a three-star. According to the officials, Gates also agreed that the head of the National Guard &#151; currently Lt. Gen. H. Steven Blum &#151; should be made an adviser to the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other top military commanders. In its March report, the commission concluded that the National Guard and Reserves don't get enough money or equipment and are left out of important planning for national emergencies. The panel found a significant lack of communication between reserve officials and other military leaders, the Department and U.S. Northern Command, which is responsible for the military's defense of the U.S. Many of the 23 recommended changes are largely administrative, aimed at improving coordination between the various federal agencies. Gates also rejected a proposal that would require that at all times either the commander or deputy commander of U.S. Northern Command be a Guard or Reserve officer, and a change that would elevate the Guard to a joint military command. During the Senate hearing, lawmakers expressed repeated concerns about whether Guard units in the states are adequately prepared and have all the needed equipment to respond to disasters. "These Guard and Reserve have answered the call when they've been sent abroad. But we also need them to answer the call at home if they're needed," said Sen. Patrick Leahy ( Gates said there is nearly $22 billion in the budget for the Army Guard between 2008-2013.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070511/ap_on_re_eu/germany_sept_11_trial	Sept. 11 suspect loses appeal in Germany - Yahoo! News Sept. 11 suspect loses appeal in Germany By DAVID RISING, Associated Press Writer Fri May 11, 9:17 AM ET BERLIN - Germany's top criminal court on Friday said it had refused to take up the appeal of a Moroccan man convicted of helping three of the Sept. 11 suicide pilots in their plot, leaving the 33-year-old with no further legal action possible in the country. Mounir el Motassadeq was convicted in November of being an accessory to the murder of the 246 passengers and crew on the four jetliners used in the 2001 terrorist attacks. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, the maximum penalty possible under German law, and the Federal Court of Justice said it found el Motassadeq's appeal to be "unfounded" in a May 2 decision. Germany's constitutional court in January had already refused to hear a separate appeal in which el Motassadeq's attorneys claimed that evidence from other terrorism suspects was not properly considered at his trial. The decision Friday was a final step in what has been a long trip through the German legal system that began when el Motassadeq was arrested two months after the Sept. 11 attacks and has featured two full trials. El Motassadeq's attorney Udo Jacob has said in the past that once he had exhausted appeals in Germany he would consider taking the case to the European Court for Human Rights. El Motassadeq was first convicted and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison in 2003, but that verdict was overturned by a federal court the following year &#151; largely because of lack of evidence from al-Qaida suspects in U.S. custody. At a retrial in 2005, the U.S. provided limited summaries from the interrogation of, among others, Ramzi Binalshibh, a suspected liaison between the Hamburg hijackers and al-Qaida. The Hamburg court acquitted el Motassadeq of direct involvement in the attacks, but sentenced him to seven years for belonging to a terrorist group. Prosecutors appealed the decision, and in November the Federal Court of Justice ruled that evidence showed el Motassadeq was aware Hamburg-based hijackers Mohamed Atta, Marwan al-Shehhi and Ziad Jarrah planned to hijack and crash planes, even though he might not have known the specifics of the plot. It convicted him of 246 counts of accessory to murder in addition to the membership in a terrorist organization charge. Judge Klaus Tolksdorf ruled then that el Motassadeq had helped "watch the attackers' backs and conceal them" by doing things such as helping them keep up the appearance of being regular university students &#151; paying tuition and rent fees, and transferring money. Tolksdorf said it was irrelevant to el Motassadeq's guilt whether he knew of the planned timing, dimension or targets of the attacks.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070511/ts_nm/cuba_usa_dc	Cuba says U.S. broke anti-terrorism treaties - Yahoo! News Cuba says U.S. broke anti-terrorism treaties HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba accused the United States on Friday of violating international anti-terrorism treaties by failing to prosecute an anti-Castro militant and former operative wanted for bomb attacks against the country. Cuba said Washington should have arrested Cuban exile Luis Posada Carriles under its own Patriot Act as a security threat and called for his extradition to Venezuela to stand trial for plotting from Caracas the downing of a Cuban airliner that killed 73 people in 1976. "The U.S. government should have tried Posada Carriles for terrorism," Cuba said in a statement that deplored the freeing of the accused bomber in United States after a U.S. judge dismissed immigration fraud charges against him on Tuesday. "Let&#39;s see what the White House does now. It still has the option to fulfill its international obligations to detain Luis Posada Carriles and extradite him to Venezuela," the statement published in the Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Cuba said the immigration indictment was a "smoke screen" to avoid prosecuting Posada Carriles for acts of violence that would have revealed his links over 25 years to the Posada Carriles, 79, was arrested in Miami in 2005 after illegally entering the United States. Cuba also accuses him of plotting a wave of bomb blasts in Havana hotels and nightclubs that killed an Italian tourist in 1997. By not prosecuting Posada Carriles for his violent past, the United States had failed to comply with U.N. Resolution 1373, a wide-ranging counter-terrorism adopted in the wake of the September 11, 2001 attacks, among other international conventions, Cuba said. The Cuban exile could yet be indicted on terrorism charges in the United States by a federal grand jury impaneled in Newark, New Jersey to determine his role in the 1997 Havana bombings, the Miami Herald reported last week. took the unusual step of sending agents to Cuba to gather evidence late last year, the newspaper said. In a 1998 interview, Posada Carriles told The New York Times he plotted the wave of bomb blasts from Central America. He later denied saying so. Trained by the CIA for its failed Bay of Pigs invasion to oust Cuban leader in 1961, Posada Carriles was jailed in Venezuela for the 1976 bombing of the Cuban airliner, but escaped from prison in 1985. He was jailed in Panama for plotting to blow up Castro during a regional summit in 2000, but was pardoned by outgoing President Mireya Moscoso in 2004. Cuba has displayed in an exhibition hall evidence of the string of bombings allegedly masterminded by the man it calls Latin America&#39;s Photographs show plastic explosives smuggled into Cuba in shampoo bottles, digital clocks used to make time bombs and damages caused by the blasts. Targets included Havana&#39;s famed Tropicana cabaret and the Bodeguita del Medio, where writer Ernest Hemingway once drank his mojitos.

News Veto threat looms over security bill By JIM ABRAMS, Associated Press Writer Wed May 9, 9:40 PM ET WASHINGTON - The Bush administration warned the House on Wednesday that legislation to authorize Department programs would face a veto if it gives the agency's 170,000 employees greater collective bargaining rights. The White House said eliminating the current personnel system would "diminish the department's ability to respond quickly to security threats and would negatively impact the security of the nation." The bill, which approves $39.8 billion for Homeland Security programs in the budget year starting Oct. 1, passed by the House on Wednesday on a 296-126 vote, sending it to the Senate. The labor dispute was a major sticking point when Congress in decided in 2002 to consolidate 22 agencies into the new department after the Sept. 11 attacks. The bill creating the agency easily passed the House, but it stalled in the Senate for months. Democrats balked at 's insistence that he needed the power to hire, fire and shift workers without the civil service protections most federal workers have. According to the final compromise, the agency has the ultimate say over labor rules if there is an impasse. The president was given the authority, in an emergency, to strip workers of bargaining rights. The White House said eliminating this system would upset the balance "between the flexibility needed to defend against a ruthless enemy and the fairness needed to ensure employee rights." Beth Moten, legislative and political director of the American Federation of Government Employees, said morale at the department is lower than in any other federal agency. "It's time to restore the rights and protections of employees at the Department of Homeland Security so they can concentrate on the job they need to do, which is protecting all of us," she said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( ), D-Calif., said the bill would restore funds for grants "that allow those on the front lines to prepare and respond to threats or disasters" as well as streamline management, reform contracting practices and improve oversight at the agency. But Republicans complained that the final version undercut several security programs, including one funding employee immigration checks at high risk sites and another allowing emergency communication grants to be used for first responder training. At the end of the debate, Republicans succeeded in pushing through a measure allowing the Homeland Security secretary to authorize the Automated Targeting System that uses information already available on high-risk passengers entering the country. Civil rights and privacy groups have criticized the program, which is being used by the Customs and Border Patrol.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070510/ap_on_re_eu/russia_bomb_plot	Russia orders 2 arrested in bomb plot - Yahoo! News Russia orders 2 arrested in bomb plot Thu May 10, 4:08 PM ET MOSCOW - A court Thursday ordered the arrest of two men allegedly involved in what security agents said was a thwarted terror plot planned for Victory Day involving an explosives-laden car, a spokeswoman said. The Lefortovo District Court sanctioned the arrest of Umar Batukayev and Ruslan Musaeva in connection with the investigation, said court spokeswoman Anna Usacheva. She identified Batukayev as a student at a Moscow law university, but gave no other information on Musaeva or any other details. Earlier, Russian news agencies quoted officials with the Federal Security Service, or FSB, as saying that law enforcement agents had discovered an explosives-laden passenger car near a residential building in a Moscow region on Tuesday and only finished defusing it on Thursday. Demolition experts used a robot to retrieve bomb components, including a radio to set off the bomb, a grenade, a fuse and electric detonators, as well as a submachine gun with two cartridge clips, Interfax quoted the FSB as saying. A search of the back seat revealed a bomb containing 15 pounds of plastic explosives and ball bearings, computer chips and additional charges, Interfax said. Russian television broadcast video of security agents shooting a water cannon at a small, partially wrecked Russian-made sedan. An FSB duty officer confirmed the reports, but refused to elaborate. News agencies quoted the FSB as saying that several people from the North Caucasus region had been detained in the investigation. RIA-Novosti quoted a defense lawyer for Batukayev as saying that the court order for his client's arrest was illegal and that he would challenge the order. The Russian organization For Human Rights said Batukayev's relatives complained they could barely recognize him when he appeared at the Lefortovo court Thursday, that he could not stand up, and that he appeared to have been brutally beaten. Law enforcement officials could not be reached for comment on the allegations. Security forces routinely go on higher alert during Victory Day, which marks the triumph over Nazi Germany in World War II.

http://us.rd.yahoo.com/dailynews/rss/terrorism/*http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070509/ap_on_re_eu/germany_raids	Fear of G-8 violence prompts German raid - Yahoo! News Fear of G-8 violence prompts German raid By KIRSTEN GRIESHABER, Associated Press Writer Wed May 9, 4:50 PM ET BERLIN - Hundreds of German police used anti-terrorism laws Wednesday to raid the offices and apartments of globalization opponents they fear could disrupt next month's Group of Eight summit with firebombings and other attacks. Security officials also announced tighter border controls ahead of the June 6-8 summit in the northern resort town of Heiligendamm. Some 900 federal and local police officers in Berlin and other cities searched about 40 offices and apartments used by several left-wing activists and groups, they said. Prosecutors said they were investigating more than 18 people suspected of organizing what they called a terrorist group that planned to carry out firebombings and other violence to hinder the summit of world leaders. "The militant extreme left groups and their members are suspected of having founded a terrorist group, or of being members of such an organization, with the specific goal of staging fire bombings and other violent attacks in order to disrupt or prevent the upcoming G-8 summit in Heiligendamm," federal prosecutors said in a statement. Germany's interior ministry announced it would tighten border controls to screen out violent protesters. People can usually travel freely within the but individual countries maintain the right to tighten checks for security purposes. Violence has marred past summits, particularly in 2001 in Genoa, Italy, when police and protesters clashed in the streets for days. Federal prosecutors said the raids focused on dismantling a computer server where they said many leftist groups maintained Web sites and mailing lists. Activists, who will hold approved marches in nearby Rostock ahead of the summit, said the raids were aimed at silencing protests against the G-8, disrupting communication among anti-globalization groups and tracking down the names of individuals involved in them. Some of groups that were targeted in the raid planned to block roads leading to Heiligendamm on June 6 to prevent politicians, journalists and service staff from reaching the summit, said one activist. "The consequences of these searches for us is that it will bring the groups closer together and we will continue to mobilize for a massive blockade of the G-8 summit," said Tim Laumeyer, a member of the Anti-Fascist Leftists of Berlin. Police took copies of the group's mailing lists and data on their computers. Investigators also searched private apartments, a photo archive, left-wing publishing houses and community centers. "The goal of the raids was to collect information about potential disruptions during the G-8 and intimidate activists ahead of the summit," said Christoph Kliesing, a lawyer for the protesters. A member of Gipfelsoli Infogruppe, a group that collects and spreads information about protests against the G-8, said that their Web page had been down all day. "They cut the cable of the server," said Matthias Monroy of Gipfelsoli. "This is really awful for us &#151; all our information about the protests is not accessible anymore and we don't know if we will be able to retrieve all the material." German security officials have built a $17-million fence around the northern seaside resort of Heiligendamm, hoping to keep protesters away. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is hosting the event, and the leaders of the United States, Russia, Britain, France, Italy, Canada, and Japan are to attend. The protesters say they oppose the G-8 summit because the world's rich leaders ignore the suffering of people in developing countries while unrestrained globalization helps big business at the expense of the environment and workers.
